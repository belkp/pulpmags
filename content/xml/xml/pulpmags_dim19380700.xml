Her bare head, crowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a duchess braid of luxuriant, raven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">black hair, was lowered as her tall, well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed body bent into an eddying gust;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high-boned cheek was waxen pale,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the strong white hands clenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly before her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the first dusty fingers reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from the seething wall to mold the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silken blouse against her breasts, and im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pudently flip the hem of the graceful</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirt above her knees. And when, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last minute before the storm swallowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, I saw her fling her head up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash a wild look into the boiling mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing down upon her, I had the fantas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic thought that the pained contortion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her regal features was caused not by fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the storm itself, but by terror of some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing she had seen in the writhing dust!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, before she could pass in her de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined eflfort to press on westward, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick, black cloud moved across the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow, completely wiping out our view. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As swiftly as it came the storm moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">on.

I hardly heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieks and whimpers of fright that rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">up from the group, for paralyzing terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">held me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the girl, the lovely stranger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had come into view just before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm struck. But God! What the storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done to her!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The tall, well-formed body was nude</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for a few ragged wisps of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer garment that, as the retreating wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maids for the Dust-Devils</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped back at them, whipped around</seg><seg type="columnLine">her waist. The black hair, loosened from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its braid, was now tumbled into wanton</seg><seg type="columnLine">curls as if it had just been rumpled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">play of love. The red mouth, morst and</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-open, seemed to bear the burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">print of fierce kisses. All the strong grace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her hinted shockingly of a Delilah's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruel ecstasies--just consummated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But, in the split-second of my paralysis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stared at the great, ragged abrasions---</seg><seg type="columnLine">flecked with queer, gelatinous globules--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that scraped her white shoulder, diag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onaled her arrogant breasts, and dug</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper across the undulating line of stom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ach and thigh, as if made by some mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster from whose huge, destructive, hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had just escaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She turned, and her long-lashed eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to stare straight into mine with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flash of dazed triumph. Then she flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hand high--her right hand--grasping</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange-looking grey thing. And as</seg><seg type="columnLine">her long-drawn, ululant cry split the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she pitched face down on the dusty side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TNSTANTLY I was in the street with</seg><seg type="columnLine">•** the villagers and Saturday-idle farm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers who surged out from the stores where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been watching the storm, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began to realize a dreadful seriousness</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">For three years, the simple people of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this little farming community had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">their labor bear nothing but sterility, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched their homes slipping away, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">families reduced to want. The losing</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle against unremitting deluges of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust had left minds agonized, nerves taut</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the breaking point, and imagination</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild and morbid. And now&gt; even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last few months had brought new</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope, they were ready to stampede at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first appearance of anything they did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Immediately their oft-flayed minds re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verted to the superstitious rantings of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">John the Hermit to supply a supernatural</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation of this strange occurrence in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their midst. There is little wind in a dust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm and so, they whispered to each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, the girl's attacker--her lover--must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have.-been the Dust Devil!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I had no time to think of explanations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for somehow, though I had accepted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistant directorship of reclamation here</seg><seg type="columnLine">because Kay Frazer, my fiancee, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">teaching their small school, my work had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to mean more than a job, and I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible now. So, sending Kay inside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I mustered all possible firmness to deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the terrified mob crowding around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nude, unconscious girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I urged them to stand back. With mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinous mutterings, they slowly gave a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, but I saw nerves quivering in toil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn faces and superstition slinking into</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust-reddened eyes, as Dr. Larmer, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">village practitioner, crowded through and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knelt with me over the inert body of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She lay prone, right arm doubled be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath her. The left arm was outflung and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left knee bent as if bracing against un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterable agony. Dr. Larmer did not look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the girl's pale, patrician face half-cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered with the loose ebony curls, but, hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fumbled his scarred stethoscope from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the battered case, he placed it against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue-veined whiteness of her superb back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just under the left shoulder blade. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd held its breath while he squatted</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, listening for her heart-beat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred uneasily when, a moment later, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to growl, testily, "Well, she's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, but somebody's got to take care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Who is she?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The question was flung all around, but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this village where each least detail of</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone's life is common knowledge, no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body claimed to know her. Who she was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where she had come from, or why she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had entered the little isolated town, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a complete mystery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But Dr. Larmer was impatiently insist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that someone take her for a few day's</seg><seg type="columnLine">care. Knowing the town had no hospital</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no hotel, I looked around the ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">of staring faces, expecting many offers</seg><seg type="columnLine">from these usually hospitable westerners.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grim silence met my unspoken appeal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mrs. Bailey," I finally began, "won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But Mrs. Bailey recoiled with shudder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing protest, and her husband crowded for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward toward me, belligerently.

"Dan,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said to me, "why not let me take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor girl up to my cottage?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Involuntarily I recoiled, a protest</seg><seg type="columnLine">springing to my lips, while for an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was flicked by the same illogical un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">easiness that had touched the supersti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tious mob.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But Dr. Larmer was enthusiastically</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepting Kay's offer, and, ashamed of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange momentary lapse, I had to agree</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the little cottage, where Kay and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her bronze-haired assistant, Anna Falk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived, was the best place for the lovely</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger. The staring circle had closed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, but someone pushed through to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread a blanket beside the still, white girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I helped the doctor turn her over, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to wrap the blanket around her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, I saw--the thing she clutched in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hand!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A wave of fantastic thoughts washed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over my mind, and I was hardly aware of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the recoiling circle as, terrified, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped on each other in their haste to</seg><seg type="columnLine">back away. But my own wild thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were prodded by their choking, staccato</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear: "The Dust Devil! ... I told you!</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . .

It was Satur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day afternoon, and yet there were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">children racing gayly in and out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">candy and ice-cream cones. No romances</seg><seg type="columnLine">budding on street-corners and at soda</seg><seg type="columnLine">fountains. No chattering women peering</seg><seg type="columnLine">through windows at gay prints. No men</seg><seg type="columnLine">swapping yarns at the curb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead, families were huddled together</seg><seg type="columnLine">in old Fords and ramshackle wagons, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the care of the strangely-silent women-</seg><seg type="columnLine">folk, while nearby knots of men talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">together in urgent tones. One throng</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught sight of me; the group pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">together and lowered their voices to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In front of the barber shop, a cluster</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my men--laborers on the reclamation</seg><seg type="columnLine">project--suddenly stopped their talking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked toward me, as if hoping for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some reassurance. But I only waved and</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed on, for what did I have to say?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">So, with a queer intangible dread tag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging at my heels, I walked the few blocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Kay's house.

So, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anna, Kay's assistant, with the sick girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I drew Kay into the living-room,' and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed her dear warm body close to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying desperately to regain a feeling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">normality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But she herself was strangely nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">and distraught.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement had been all out of propor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to what had happened. It was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple. A bottle of add had overturned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and broken the thing down into a harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less pool of dust and almost-clear fluid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And somehow I felt relieved. I was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to phone Kay to reassure her, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">from out somewhere in the street a cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">of terror rose up.

I pushed my way in among</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, stood behind the plate glass where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kay and I that very morning had watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first dust storm. And a cold, fatalistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">premonition swept over me. I felt that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gears of time had slipped backward--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had lived this exact moment before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what had happened, and must there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore happen now, predestined from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As before, the street was deserted, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time not even John the Hermit was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there to cry out his frantic warnings. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust-cliff was slipping down the street.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now it was scudding past Rankin's Hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ware across the street, now beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw a curtain across the show-window</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Henry's Cafe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was like a movie film I had seen be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore. I knew its inevitable sequence. So,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a queer daze, I stared into the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for what must come, waited until,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the moment the storm was almost upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, there appeared, as was fated to appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a girl, one lone girl!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But this time it was not a regal</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger; it was Gertie Glass, the pretty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">little blonde waitress, coming out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rosebud Beauty Shop across the street, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspaper held over her fresh finger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave. She was dashing for Henry's Cafe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just two doors west of the beauty shop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurrying to her five-o'clock shift.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Blind, unreasonable fear clutched at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me--fear for the girl--fear that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the verge of some cataclysmic, soul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattering discovery. Something my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not support.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She was in sight only a split second, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw a teasing finger of wind reach out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and press the flimsy green uniform-blouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">against her breasts; another eddy whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green skirt close about her firm, young</seg><seg type="columnLine">hips. Then in the boiling palisade of dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was almost upon her, I seemed to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">a denser, more definite blob, with long</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous feelers pushing out from its huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">amorphous body--like some rhizopodic</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster bred from the dust, eagerly seek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a victim. My wild imagination saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, grey tentacle reach out, slap the</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspaper from the girl's hair, clutch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">still-wet, yellow ringlets, and--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Somehow I broke my paralysis, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang to the door. But by the time I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside, I saw her hand reach out toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The door opened and then the storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit, blotting out everything. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The illusion of a monster in the swirl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing dust had lasted no longer than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flicker of an eyelash, yet as I jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">back inside and stared into the dust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkened street, I could not keep from</seg><seg type="columnLine">picturing an insatiable, inhuman menace</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalking our town. I tried to recall my</seg><seg type="columnLine">glib explanations of what had happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the. strange girl whom Kay was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving shelter.

Yet, I watched. . . .

The orange-cuffed sleeves</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly outflung; extending from beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flimsy green skirt, the cheap silk hose</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching out limply into the high-heeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">pumps. The Weekly Clarion, the news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper that had covered her fresh finger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave, scudded toward the gutter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knelt above that strange arrangement</seg><seg type="columnLine">of garments, and peered at the row of</seg><seg type="columnLine">buttons, beginning at the close-fitting or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ange collar and running down the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the blouse--still buttoned.

Can the mind of man endure</seg><seg type="columnLine">more ? I cried to myself as I plunged up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street toward the cry, the others stum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling after me, crashing into each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their panic. Two blocks up, we came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the creature who had uttered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream of agony--a mother, standing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her front yard, staring with glazed eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a strange arrangement of dainty gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments--like a limp, paper-doll cut-out!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another girl gone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then before the full horror of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene could sink into our minds, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther on in the deepening twilight, an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other scream. Hoarse, agonized, torn from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strong man's throat. And others, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north, to the south, rising up from every</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like leaves driven by a gust of wind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terror-maddened crowd swept through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the streets of that little town, tracking</seg><seg type="columnLine">down tragedy. But I did not follow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heart cold with fear, I ran into a corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">grocery and called Kay's number.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the blessed relief of hearing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maids for the Dust-Devils</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, I clung to the phone-box weakly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Darling! Darling, are you all right?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shouted wildly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, of course, dear. But I seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear shouting down the street. What is</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Thanking God that the little school</seg><seg type="columnLine">house and cottage was at the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">town and she could not know the horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping around her, I calmed myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say, "I'm coming right up. Promise me</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will not go outside until I get there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As I turned from the phone to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Kay, Shelton came in the door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grocery. Pale and tense, he forgot his</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual annoying over-politeness and spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me without greeting. "Dan, I've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get Mrs. Shelton and our daughter out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of here. Dynamite will drive us into Ok-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lahoma City. You'll have to hold the</seg><seg type="columnLine">works until I get back. The men have</seg><seg type="columnLine">their orders for tonight, so there'll be just</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sunday shifts. We'll be back by Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then, the full weight of my responsibil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity settling upon me, I stepped into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusk of the street, and saw "Doc" Walters</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbling down the walk back toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Catching sight of me, he stopped to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell me of the swath of horror cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the little town. With terror-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk tongue, he enumerated the names</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the victims, described the nuclei of</seg><seg type="columnLine">grief and madness, scattered among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people--two, four, five, seven! Seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">feminine costumes lying limply in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street! Seven lovely bodies, by some hell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish metamorphosis, delivered into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of an incredible monster!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Seven mates for the Dust Devil. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      CHAPTER THREE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      Into the Darkness</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T HAD found Kay at the point of col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapse, for she had learned, after my</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephone call, of the disappearance of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">girls. And Anna Falk, her assistant, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them! But now a dull incredulity</seg><seg type="columnLine">had settled upon her. There on the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Anna's volume of Swinburne, marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her favorite book-mark. Over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair-back was flung her blue scarf. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">her desk, letters from her mother and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweetheart waited to be answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But she was gone. And there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing we could do. No coffin to buy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No body for the undertaker. How?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where? In what hideous state did her</seg><seg type="columnLine">body exist? Impatiently I jerked my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, for I must not let it slide off again</seg><seg type="columnLine">.into the wild thoughts I had had when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I looked at those empty clothes on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side-walk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"It can't be," Kay kept saying; "things</seg><seg type="columnLine">■like this don't happen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet they had happened. Gertie Glass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pretty waitress; clear-eyed Jane</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thomas on her way to a violin lesson;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lovely, black-haired bride of Lloyd</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones ; the vivacious, red-headed Kelsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">twins, in town from the farm; the taffy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired, blue-eyed, slow-speaking Bertha</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christman; and Anna--here at the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Kay's lawn!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was madness to enumerate them, try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to force some pattern from those awe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some tragedies. The only certainty was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these girls were gone--gone most</seg><seg type="columnLine">horribly. . . !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly, a thought burst in my brain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The victims had not been chosen indis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">criminately !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a pattern! A frighteningly</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious one: all victims were girls, beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful girls!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Again the wild thought flashed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind that these girls had been taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">to become mates for the dust monster. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lovely unknown in the adjoining room</seg><seg type="columnLine">had won the struggle--at the cost of only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit of flesh. The others had lost, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bodies had, at the vile touch, flowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to--God knew what!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Disgustedly, I checked my thoughts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for I knew I must get rid of these wild,</seg><seg type="columnLine">intangible ideas. Now was the time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">common-sense; there was danger here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No use to deny that. Menace was lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">in wait for every lovely woman in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">town. And Kay--Kay was the loveliest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them all!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And it seemed to me, now that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced myself to think straight, that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only one answer. Some degenerate</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster was loose in our land; some sex</seg><seg type="columnLine">criminal, under the cover of the dusters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had invaded our town, stolen the flower</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our womanhood. Thank God, Kay had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been inside attending the sick girl!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I had come here to make sure of Kay's</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety and await the telephone call to</seg><seg type="columnLine">announce that the posse, which was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">organized, was ready to start. I was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager than ever to start now--to track</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the fiend who stalked our girls; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began charting a route of search in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">notebook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Kay excused herself saying, "I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepare my sick guest something to eat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I succeeded in getting her to take some</seg><seg type="columnLine">soup at lunch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">While Kay was making the soup, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went into the bedroom and looked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">pity at the lovely ghost-pale face, framed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in heavy black waves of hair. The cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose and fell with her quiet even breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, but her waxen face was like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exquisite death mask. When Kay came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in to feed her, I went back through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">living-room to the kitchen and stood look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the stubbornly silent telephone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly, I heard a crash--a tray of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dishes clattering to the floor, and Kay was</seg><seg type="columnLine">calling, "Dan! Dan!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I hurried back through kitchen, dinette,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and living-room to help Kay with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient, and pulled up sharp, staring in</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismay at--emptiness!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dishes lay in a shattered heap beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">an overturned chair. The covers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed were in wild disarray. The bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room's outside door swung ajar against</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness outside. Both girls were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T DON'T know all the things I did dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing those next few hours. I plunged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all directions down dark streets, even be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond into the country road. I flooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little two-roomed schoolhouse with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flashlight, and searched in every closet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and corner. I called, I wept, I cried-out</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kay's name. I went down town and</seg><seg type="columnLine">begged Constable Sears for help. He said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the posse had been difficult to or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ganize, but that it would be ready to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">before long. To him, Kay was just an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other girl--not the only girl in the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Completely exhausted and defeated, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to the little cottage, for then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I seemed closer to Kay. I threw myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the bed, buried my face in her pillow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried desperately to make sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last ten hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  God! Only ten hours, for it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet midnight, and it had been almost two</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I had stood over the nude body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beautiful stranger who had been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first to be attacked by the foul fiend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And as my thoughts came around to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, I realized how selfish I had been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my grief for Kay. Not one thought had</seg><seg type="columnLine">I given the girl whose scarred body had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been snatched from the sick-bed. In what</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin could she and Kay be? Were they</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this minute in the arms of a sex-crazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiend? How could he have stolen them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with so little noise ? . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Suddenly, I heard the door-lock click,</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly. I raised my head, stared, as slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knob turned. I never moved, gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">riveted to that little brass ball moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost imperceptibly. At last, the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell back, and, framed in the doorway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the black background of night, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the lovely stranger!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Her beautiful, perfectly-molded body</seg><seg type="columnLine">was covered only by the sheer flowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">folds of a chiffon night-gown. The clas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sic strength of her--the long, firm thighs;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maids for the Dust-Devils</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the plastic, curving waist; the proud, lift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing breasts; the straight, smooth throat--</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like the perfection of a beautiful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grecian statue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I sprang to her, gripped her fine, white</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders. "Kay!" I cried out. "Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">is Kay?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Her dark violet eyes looked deep into</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine, her arms encircled my neck, her tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">body swayed against me, wilted in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Hastily I guided her to the bed, tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stretch her out upon its tumbled sheets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">make her comfortable. But she pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">me down to the edge of the bed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved herself close against me, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong, young arms fast around my waist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hair a black pool against the grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapel of my coat, her eyes closed as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">in deep contentment, her full scarlet lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling provocatively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Impatiently I shook her. I shouted at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her: "Where is Kay?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Her beautiful mouth curved as if for</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech. My heart stood still as I waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her words. But suddenly her lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed tightly and terror seemed to flick</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her features. Then all the tense-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness was gone out of her and, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long sigh, she fell back in my arms, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious. ...</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">When the call finally came and I rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the dark village to join the posse</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the court-house square, I could see, here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there, lighted windows where, I knew,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bereaved families were keeping the death-</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch without even the comfort of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold, peaceful body of the loved one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">We searched every possible hiding-place</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the whole barren countryside, including</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shacks at the reclamation camp, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we returned in the chill prairie dawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no word for the bereaved, I won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered if it were possible that their grief</seg><seg type="columnLine">could match the aching despair in my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, as I had never ceased to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the long futile night of search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, I kept thinking of the stranger who</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay in Kay's bed. And it seemed to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the clue we needed must rest with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. By what strange coincidence had she</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped--twice!--when the others had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been swallowed up so completely? Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">she a hellish decoy, an accomplice in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">diabolic plot that had carried away our</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls? It is true she couldn't have car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried Kay away with so little struggle; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could have signalled to someone out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. How else could anyone have known</seg><seg type="columnLine">that for that brief instant, Kay was out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my sight?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet, if she were a fake; if she were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a girl in a hypnotic trance induced by</seg><seg type="columnLine">fright, then she was the cleverest de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiver I had ever seen. At the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">town, I left the posse, and went by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cottage where I had left her with Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larmer, the only person I had been able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to persuade to stay with her.

And a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little further on was a ramshackle Ford,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its trailer filled with pitiful remnants of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nHHEY were on their way out I knew.s</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  These were the people Kay and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried so hard to help.

My grief became identified</seg><seg type="columnLine">with this tragedy of the people and settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">more inexorably upon me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But the deserters were few. And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mass-meeting was over, I had a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciation of the courage and common-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of these level-headed, laconic men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For even though an ungodly, supersti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tious fear gleamed in the eyes of many,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had, with a few, brusque words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound themselves together in a pact to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick with their homes and their land.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rather than drag their families out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">join the thousands of hopeless, unwanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanderers driven from town to town, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were going to stay, pinning their last</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes on the work of reclamation--our</seg><seg type="columnLine">work--today, my work. For the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">since I had lost Kay, I remembered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole project was in my hands for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At the thought, courage rose in me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">match the hope and determination of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. I got my car and drove the five</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles to the center of operations--the al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most-finished irrigation well and its sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem of canals--to supervise the day shift.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though I was late, and the night-workers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were already off duty, the day men had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet gone to work. They were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">huddled in nervous groups around the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">long pine breakfast tables, talking fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively. It was the first time work had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever stopped since we had begun opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion six weeks before. As soon as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw me, the night men scattered, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others went to work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The day was a tortured blur. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn between duty and love. Yet, I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would have deserted the work had there</seg><seg type="columnLine">been anything to be done for Kay. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the night, our posse had covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything. Soon the state police would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be out. Now there was nothing I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But I wore myself out dashing into</seg><seg type="columnLine">town to inquire for news, and back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp to try to keep the nervous, restive</seg><seg type="columnLine">men on the job. As the day wore on, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">activities no longer seemed separate</seg><seg type="columnLine">events, but were all jumbled together into</seg><seg type="columnLine">one blur of restless unhappiness. I kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">wishing there were forests, or hills, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">some place in this barren country where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could spend my energy in search. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">it must have been a need for a change that</seg><seg type="columnLine">took me, late in the afternoon, over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry coulee which I had always felt, in spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Shelton's arguments, should be made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a useful part of our work. And when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood on the steep cliff at the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arroyo, I wondered crazily, if I found good</seg><seg type="columnLine">use for this sun-baked, dust-blighted hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, the Almighty might accept it as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of bribe to help me find Kay, safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and untouched by horror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly, far down, at the other end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dry coulee, I saw a little cloud of mist</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovering close to the ground, strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the mists that hovered over the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth when first life began to stir.

With her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">movement, a wisp of slimy green loosened</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a translucent shoulder and slithered</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the mound of breast and floated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. With a deep, hungry bellow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blunt leaped forward and snatched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's slender body to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And the sharpness of the horror broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">through into my consciousness, for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl--that creature who had surrendered</seg><seg type="columnLine">--was Kay!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Tugging at my gun, I plunged down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slope and scrambled upon the high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose dirt that flanked the narrow canal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As if Blunt's advance had been a signal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other men had plunged forward.

Then directing her toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the group of men and girls so strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">and quietly huddled in the basin between</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, he--struck a match!

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall, somber figure of the man had dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms, lifted his eyes from the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gaze moodily at Stefanie and myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we came up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was death there at his feet, tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">and immaterial death--but symbolic.

We can say when an</seg><seg type="columnLine">organism begins to function, it is what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">call life; when it apparently ceases to</seg><seg type="columnLine">function, it is death. But in man, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is something beyond this mere bodily</seg><seg type="columnLine">functioning, something beyond the mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even. We choose to call it the soul. Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">does this soul come from before we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">born; where does it go when we die ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am a scientist, mind you, and scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tists can explain life and death in terms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of physics and chemistry.

But what happens</seg><seg type="columnLine">when life is suspended ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"We see a girl swimmer suddenly seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a cramp, see her go under.

Then, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did use the hypodermic, I was so clumsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nervous I feared at first that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a terrible mistake, missed the vein</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the precious antidote.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it worked--it worked as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were a necromancer's magic potion--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as Nathaniel Creighton had died he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back to life--he returned to full con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness a trembling, eager, wildly ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cited man who leaped from the couch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized me by the arms. His eyes burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a mystic fervor, he shouted at me:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have done it! I have done it!

Besides, the turmoil in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart would have kept me from paying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">much attention to even a worse night than</seg><seg type="columnLine">this black, stormy one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I started down the village's one street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">past house after house--and not one light</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed. And that was odd. Even in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small town there are usually a few people</seg><seg type="columnLine">who are up at midnight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I think the people in Boganville are</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of something." The conductor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">words came back to me. "They don't roam</seg><seg type="columnLine">around in that town after dark."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Afraid of the name of Corse, perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought bleakly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TpRED, last of the Corses, was an aris*</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ tocratic looking young man. Probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">generations of almost feudal power over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ignorant, backward residents of Bog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anville had given the family that aspect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But there was something subtly disturb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about his slender elegance that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally stopped my acquaintanceship with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, though I had let it drop with no open</seg><seg type="columnLine">break.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a sort of serpentine grace</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his body; a kind of veiled deadliness</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his. dark eyes and triangular face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Added to that, in college, had been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">queerness of his library: one of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">extensive collections of books on after-life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit-visitations, and ghost-lore that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A curious person was Fred Corse, full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of contradictions; a dark mystic. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd come to know Stella better I had asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">her what she really thought of him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had confessed to a suppressed fear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dislike of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And now--she was married to him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"He forced her, some way," I swore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I slogged through the rain and mud</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the cliff.

Could Corse have sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, signing Stella's name to it, for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy reason ? He was arrogant enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Oh, yes, Fred was arrogant enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare anything. The Corse family owned</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the land surrounding Boganville.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The inbred, moronic villagers all worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Fred.

And the knife that cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">them was a scream. A girl's scream! Once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice, it split the eerie darkness, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hair on my scalp prickle with the terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">it contained. Then it stopped--and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">running toward the source of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The scream had come from the muddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">road beyond me. I couldn't see any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, but obviously a woman, ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me somewhere, was in danger of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind and urgently needed help.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"They don't roam around in that town</seg><seg type="columnLine">much after dark."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The lightning ripped a jagged splash in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black veil of the night, and I saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">person who had screamed, directly ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me in the road. I got to her quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A girl of nineteen or so, she stood in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the mud, with the rain plastering</seg><seg type="columnLine">her brown hair to her cheeks and dripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">unheeded from long lashes over wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunted eyes. She had on a white dress--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the garment was in rags over her</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapely body, exposing her soft breast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">graceful shoulders. Her eyes, beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, glared at me with a haunted, stunned</seg><seg type="columnLine">look in them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She was staring straight at me as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped her bare wet shoulder, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't seem to see me. It was very queer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt a cold sensation touch my spine. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like a person in a hypnotic trance. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">more sound came from her lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's the matter ?" I said. "Are you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt? You called for help, didn't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She said nothing. Not one thing. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">just kept on looking at me--or, rather,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through me--as if I didn't exist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was then that I felt moisture on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers that clasped the silky skin of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder which was not the cold moisture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rain. It was warm, sticky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"After me . . ." she mumbled wildly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Dead Ones ... They3re after me ..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUDDENLY she was running crazily</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ from me in the rain, with her body</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking like that of a naked woman be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of the way the rain plastered her</seg><seg type="columnLine">white dress to her. It was then, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning flared, that I saw the thing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her back: a long thin stripe of ragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">red, where blood had come from a kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gash, or cut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She didn't run far. At the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street was an old church. It was a hulking</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruin with half its roof long gone, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its steeple long since caved in. The girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran toward that, and the lightning flared</seg><seg type="columnLine">just in time for me to see her white, nude-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking figure dart within the sagging</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I followed her. The urgency of my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">business was shelved for a moment in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membrance of the horror I had seen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl's streaming face. I heard her voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounding ever more loudly as I neared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruined church.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Save me! Save me from the Dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones! Merciless spirits ... I have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">no wrong . . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The words broke once more into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">keening, terrible scream that I had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. It stopped just before I got to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and hurried inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was as dark as the grave in the ruined</seg><seg type="columnLine">church--till the brittle lightning streamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from a drenched heaven.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw the girl, then. She lay down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the aisle that led between brok-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en, long unused pews. She lay before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">overturned thing that had been a pulpit, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">white and streaming, like a naked woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But the lightning revealed other red</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripes on her white back now, besides</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one I had seen as she ran from me out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. Other gashes down her snowy flesh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And it revealed for one brief instant some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else which left me utterly bewildered</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I ran down the aisle toward her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Three vague white forms seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hover in mid-air near the body. At least I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought they were hovering there, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">patches of mist in the blackness. I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sure that they weren't simply hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">strips of paper, or white blotches of plaster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the wall behind the upset pulpit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"They're after me . . . the Dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones ..." the girl was babbling. "Souls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dead ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I bent over her, started to gather her up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my arms, to take her away from there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, in the lightning's incessant flaring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw a figure at the door. It was the figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an elderly man, straight, spare, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">lank grey hair and a fanatic's blazing eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He strode toward me, and I straightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">up from the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He, too, seemed to stare straight at me</seg><seg type="columnLine">without seeing me at all. It was as if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a ghost on that black night. He came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the girl and dropped on his knees beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. I saw a resemblance of feature be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween them. He must be her father.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"The souls," he whispered--not to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was still paying no attention to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The souls of the dead, scourging those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who sin .. "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He whirled toward me with a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">madness shining in his eyes. He crooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fingers toward me, like horns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Go! Get back to where you came from,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and take your hell's scourge with you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I stood in hesitation as he glared at me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the fire died from his eyes, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent to pick up the body of the girl. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">strode toward the door with her, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly followed. I made no move to help;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was easily able to carry her. I simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the ruin of the church, going into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashing rain again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">What lunatic talk was this of Dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones? Of scourging souls? What had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made those lone gashes on the girl's white</seg><seg type="columnLine">back? I couldn't answer. Something pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">saic and ordinary was at the bottom, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course; some natural thing distorted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorant villagers into talk of the souls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I shrugged it aside, telling myself that</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably the girl was subject to seizures</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some kind, and that in one of them she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had inflicted those wounds herself, by con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsive clawing of her own nails. I started</seg><seg type="columnLine">on toward the house atop the cliff--then</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped in my tracks. The lightning's</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash was silvering the world again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it, far ahead, I thought I saw three</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating, wraithlike shapes. Like patches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mist drifting up the cliff path ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Three things like great slow birds, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlike any birds ever seen before!

My fingers were trembling a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I pressed Corse's bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard the peal clang hollowly inside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started a bit as the door was opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner than I expected. I shrank back</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a vision of the girl's streaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounds before me. But there was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful or fantastic at the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A woman had opened it.

Were her eye-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pupils dilated because the light in this big</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">front room was dim--or because of fear ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Mr. Corse can't possibly see anybody,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"He's got to see me!

His hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched, and he paused till he could con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol his voice. Then, with his eyes glit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering more wildly, he almost smiled. "She</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't be gone from me, though," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooned.

I read it. It was a marriage</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">certificate, announcing the union of Fred</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Corse and Stella Leigh in this, the hill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">county of Crile.

His shaking hand had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone to his trembling lips. He started for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, but I beat him to it. I leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the dimly lit hall. Steps pounded on</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs at the back of the house. The steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man. Doctor Jeanne, probably. I ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward them and saw a rear stairway lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down. I started down them, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped. A sound at the back door had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught my straining ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The upper half of the rear door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house had a glass pane in it.

'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was the face of an old man, maddened</seg><seg type="columnLine">by rage.The lips were twisting under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, curving nose.

The scream from the basement</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed more important than the face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A woman's scream. The shriek of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">human being in horror. Stella's wild cry?</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Stella was dead.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I didn't pay much attention to the door--</seg><seg type="columnLine">then. My gaze was riveted to a sight in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the big room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A woman lay there. Fred's housekeeper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The doctor was bending over her, holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spoonful of some sort of dark liquid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lips. Her face was as white as a sheet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her breasts stirred with her gasping for</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. Beautiful breasts, completely ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed, for her dark dress had been ripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the front almost to her waist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a long gash between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white mounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"One of Them," I heard her pant to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor.

"It will help."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She forced the liquid down. I saw her</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat move with the effort. Then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at Doctor Jeanne vacantly, started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say something, and relaxed in a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint in his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Corse had come down the stairs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed me. Jeanne looked at him for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. I thought I saw something like grim</seg><seg type="columnLine">accusation in the doctor's level eyes. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he nodded toward the unconscious woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Help me carry her upstairs, Fred."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fred, lips ashen with something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be more than fear, bent down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Together the two men carried the lovely</seg><seg type="columnLine">body to the stairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I came after, apparently unnoticed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">both men in that crowded moment.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was alone in the hall. I drew the shroud</seg><seg type="columnLine">back . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A gasp came to my lips. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little statuette on a pedestal in the niche</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the curtain.

The fact that at first glance the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little statuette seemed to depict a kindly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">benign being--and only at second glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was revealed as a thing of pure frightful-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness--emphasized the shock its appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">So this was the kind of "spirit," of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"white soul" Fred Corse saw in his sickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams!

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped on a dim light and wordlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to a silver cigarette casket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHE took one too.

It was coming, floating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward me, with misty things like arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">outstretched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I tried to move, and couldn't. I got my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head around enough to see a white shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">looming slowly behind me, from the di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection of the windows. I heard my breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">rasp from terror-tortured lungs. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing I had first heard was near enough for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to feel a sort of clammy cold mist touch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I tried to crouch, tried to leap.

It was very dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I could barely see my hand as a dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">blotch when I held it before my face.

I sank to</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Town the Dead Things Claimed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">my knees and looked through the tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I was looking into another basement</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">room. I saw bare stone wall, illuminated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">faintly by a bluish light. I saw the end of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a table, or slab of some kind. I saw two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dainty bare feet at the end of the slab, like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">things carved in snowy marble. I gasped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at that, and the last shreds of fog fled from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my dazed brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The shock of what I saw on the slab</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when my vision had cleared is with me yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">On the black-draped slab as on a funeral</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bier, was a lovely white body. It was the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">form of a nude woman, with hands crossed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the breasts. So beautiful she seemed,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and so peaceful, that you would think she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was only sleeping there. But then I saw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the throat and face, and knew differently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The face was that of Stella Leigh! And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the throat was almost covered over by one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">great bruise.

One was Fred Corse, with his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feverish eyes glittering like black dia-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">monds. The other figure was robed all in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">black ; veiled by a garment like a priest's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cape. Over the face was a black hood, like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that of an executioner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Watching impotently through the key-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hole, I saw Fred kneel beside the nude,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">alabaster body.

As if it had been a signal, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on me.

Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one way out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I was still near the door.

I yelled toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. "They've--got--me--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I scratched at the door with bleeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingernails, then was utterly still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Over me, the white wraiths floated, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the agonizing torture of razorlike gashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued.

Under my right arm I could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway. Corse stood there, dimly to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen in the weird light that trickled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the other room.

"See how they rend him--■"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I sprang then. I saw the unholy lust</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eyes turn to amazement and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fear. I saw the black-robed figure try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shut the door in my face. Then I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the threshold with Corse's throat be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween my slashed hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Horror and loss of blood had weakened</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.

Corse saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">"materialized spirits" and was almost in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of mind to do anything Jeanne</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted.

Jeanne recognized in her the inspira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion for the little wraith in stone, in the hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">niche. It looked like Jeanne's chance. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could show Corse the materialized spir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">it of this girl, after death, the will was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">good as drawn up. Then Corse could die</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the family fortune would go to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Jeanne drugged Stella while she went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a wedding ceremony with Fred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he doped her into unconsciousness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">painted a deep bruise over her throat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Corse she'd died of a fall over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff. From the draped bier on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stella lay, one of the great bats was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">flutter up, convincing Corse that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen her soul take wing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I got there.

Instead of leaving, I tried to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigate.

The street was dark, gloomy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">imperfectly lit by the rays of a sputter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing arc lamp, shining through amorphous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coiling tendrils of fog.

The house was set</seg><seg type="columnLine">far back from the street, surrounded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tall hedge. Silently Wendell darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the gateway, crouched behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hedge. He fumbled in the pocket of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">topcoat, drew out a small flashlight. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">other hand closed around the butt of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver. With muscles tensed, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense alert, he waited for what was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Footsteps shuffled eerily over the pave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, drew nearer. Out of the gloom</seg><seg type="columnLine">swam the figure. It hesitated, stopped di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly in front of him. He jerked erect</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly thumbed the button of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash. A strangled cry broke from his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">as light sprayed over the nightmare crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was tall, thin to the point of emacia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, its skeleton body outlined beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, black cloak it wore. Bony fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were lifted malevolently, shaping into tal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ons. Underneath a felt hat, pulled low</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the forehead, sunken eyes burned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a skull without a face!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">That was the quintessence of the hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror gibbering in Dave Wendell's brain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where the features should have been there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing but scar tissue, with bits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark skin still clinging to it. The nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">was white cartilage, the cheeks eaten away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teeth gleamed in the lipless mouth, fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a perpetual, frozen grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Even as Wendell stared petrified, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous creature.snarled and struck at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">viciously. The odor of kerosene smote</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nostrils as he ducked the blow. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped on the dew-soaked grass, and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawling. He was on his feet again almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately, but that split second of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">was long enough to give the thing a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape. The sound of its footsteps thud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ded on, merged with the stillness. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wendell reached the pavement, the mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster had disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The detective cursed softly, the hair on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his scalp still crawling at the memory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horror he had seen.

Why had it smelled so strongly</seg><seg type="columnLine">of kerosene ? Unanswerable questions that</seg><seg type="columnLine">must tie up in some way with George Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's frantic telephone message. Benton</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be able to clear things up for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Pocketing his revolver and flashlight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wendell turned and followed the concrete</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk to the house. He crossed the porch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rang the bell. The door swung open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just inside stood a slight, middle-aged</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with thin, tanned features. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">semi-darkness of the hall those features</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirrored suspicion and a certain desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are Detective Wendell?" the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked tersely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wendell nodded, keen eyes studying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"And you are not connected with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police department?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wendell gestured impatiently. "I'm a</seg><seg type="columnLine">private operative, if that's what you mean,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said curtly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The man sighed with relief. "I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were," he muttered. "But I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make sure. A private detective can help</seg><seg type="columnLine">me more than the police can. I--I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">George Benton. Come into the library</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'll explain why I called you here</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The room they entered was wide and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spacious, dimly lit by scattered lamps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three walls were lined with books. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth was filled with glass cases, in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were mounted specimens of animal life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mainly native to tropical America. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were vampire bats, tiny monkeys, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">armadillo, several kinds of insects, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluding the deadly tarantula. In the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of the room was a huge desk, and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side it stood a tall, young man whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun-blackened skin contrasted oddly with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his blond hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"My secretary, Paul Lambert,"' Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton said. "Paul is as much concerned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with what I have to tell you as I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, Wendell," he continued hastily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terror Has No Face</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Both our lives, as well as the lives of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, are in terrible danger!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Danger?" The detective's eyebrows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted. "From what, may I ask?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">P EORGE BENTON didn't speak for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ long time. When he did, his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sunk to a whisper. "We are being</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatened--by a dead man!" he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarsely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wendell had schooled himself not to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised or startled by anything. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was a little too much. For an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gazed angrily into Benton's haggard</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance. Then he turned and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sorry, but I can't appreciate a prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical joke," he said coldly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm not joking," Benton panted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutching at his arm. "I'm telling you the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth, Wendell! The man who is going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill us died six months ago! We're posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive of that. And yet--we heard from him</seg><seg type="columnLine">today! We got letters from him, threaten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing our lives. You've got to'believe that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You've got to!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The detective swung around, his fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head wrinkled in a puzzled frown. Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton sounded sincere. And certainly both</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and his secretary were badly fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened. There might be something to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's crazy talk, after all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Suppose you start at the beginning and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me all about your trouble," Wendell</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton swallowed convulsively. "As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">said before, it began six months ago,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he faltered. "We were in Brazil at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, collecting specimens for the Museum</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Natural History in Washington.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Besides Lambert and myself, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were three others in the expedition. Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor John Brant, well known zoologist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was our leader. Then there were Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Melvin Shaw, on leave of absence from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Columbia University, and Philip Dray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, a brilliant young pupil of Shaw's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We--we all liked young Drayton, thought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd be a great help to us on the trip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How could we guess that the time would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come when we'd curse the day we took</seg><seg type="columnLine">him along?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then Drayton is the person you're so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much afraid of?" Wendell put in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton nodded. "Philip Drayton died</seg><seg type="columnLine">while we were in the Matto Grosso, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildest and most dangerous region in</seg><seg type="columnLine">South America," he said huskily. "There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">no question about it&gt; And still, he's found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a way to return from the dead and mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the rest of us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"It was his own fault that he lost his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life," Benton continued hysterically. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had turned back when we wanted him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to, everything would have been all right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had spent weeks along the Amazon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were well satisfied with the specimens we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had secured. It was the beginning of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rainy season, and the very breath of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle was laden with fever. Our quinine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other supplies were running low. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the circumstances it was sheer insan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity to keep on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"But Drayton insisted. He had learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a rare species of butterfly, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cyrestis thyodamas, to be found in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior of Brazil near the Rio Madera. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was determined to add the insect to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">collection. And. so he persuaded us, much</seg><seg type="columnLine">against our will, to accompany him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't know how long it took us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the Madera. I--I can't remember.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it seemed ages. The river, a tributary</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Amazon, is navigable for only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short distance because of its many falls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cataracts. We left our boat at a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">village along the stream and struck into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart of the Matto Grosso on foot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We didn't find the butterfly we sought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We found only trouble--with the Catu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quinas, a tribe of Indians native to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">region.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Apparently they had little use for</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men, for they were unfriendly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicious of us from the start. They did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not openly attack us. It would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a relief if they had. They kept out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight after the first glimpse we caught of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. But as we went through the jun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gle, their arrows began to fall around us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickering through the trees, getting closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and closer, driving us to the point of mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"A hundred times we tried desperately</seg><seg type="columnLine">to catch sight of our invisible enemies and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight back. But we never succeeded. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were too clever for us. And then, one day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an arrow struck Drayton in the hip, crip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pling him. It was too much for the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us. We broke and fled--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"And left him to the mercy of the sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages ?" Wendell said slowly. The scorn in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice cut like a whip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton flushed. "It was the only thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could do," he whined. "If we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed behind and tried to save him, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would all have been killed. What was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of sacrificing our lives for his?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"As we ran, Drayton shouted curses</seg><seg type="columnLine">after us, swore he'd pay us back for desert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him.

Benton's voice wav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered into silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"And then?" Wendell prompted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"There--there isn't much more to tell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Catuquinas didn't try to follow us. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose they were satisfied with just kill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Drayton. At any rate, we reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madera and our boat without being furth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er molested. But we didn't feel safe until</seg><seg type="columnLine">we left the jungle behind us and got back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to civilization once-more.

Six months after</seg><seg type="columnLine">his death, Philip Drayton is trying to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">good his threats and revenge himself on</seg><seg type="columnLine">us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">George Benton stopped talking abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fumbled in the pocket of his coat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He drew out a folded sheet of paper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased and frayed at the edges through</seg><seg type="columnLine">much handling. Without a word, he un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">folded it and gave it to the detective. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">k was written in huge and sprawling let-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ters the following mysterious sentence:</seg><seg type="columnLine">YOU SHALL DIE AS I DIED--</seg><seg type="columnLine">WITHOUT A FACE!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER TWO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Death Is Kind to Cowards</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T^OR a full minute Wendell studied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">message. Then he glanced again at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton's pale, frightened face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "When did you get this?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">tersely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It came in the regular letter delivery</seg><seg type="columnLine">about two o'clock this afternoon. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">envelope was postmarked New York.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drayton must have mailed it from a let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter box or a local postoffice some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the morning--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "A dead man mails you a letter, threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening your life?" Wendell exclaimed. Be</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasonable, Benton! Why are you so cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Drayton sent it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The note is in his handwriting," Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton insisted stubbornly. "I'd recognize it</seg><seg type="columnLine">anywhere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It might be a forgery," the detective</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupted again. "Someone else could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have sent that note, who knew Drayton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">handwriting well enough to imitate it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Someone'who might have been with you</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that expedition, and is using the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's threat against you now for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason of his own. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But that's impossible," Benton pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested. r'The three men who were with me</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Drayton was killed--Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brant, Doctor Shaw, and Paul Lambert</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, are entirely above suspicion. None</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them would do a thing like that even</seg><seg type="columnLine">as--as a practical joke. Besides, they all</seg><seg type="columnLine">received letters just like this one!" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to his secretary. "Show him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one you got, Paul," he gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Lambert's note was identical in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect with that of his employer's. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained the same single sentence, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same sinister warning that Benton insist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terror Has No Face</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ed had been written by a dead man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">" 'You shall died as I died---without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">face!'" Wendell read once more, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time aloud. "What does it mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">George Benton shuddered. "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know," he whispered. "Possibly the Catu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quinas did something horrible to Philip</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drayton's face before they killed him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They must have tortured him in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiendish way--before he died! And now,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton's fingers were digging into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">detective's arm. "Drayton has come back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the grave to do the same thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us! You've got to stop him, Wendell!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You've got to save us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">His voice faded away. He was trem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling all over, his blood-shot eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">piteous. And Paul Lambert seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally affected by the intangible aura</seg><seg type="columnLine">of menace that hung in the room. Sweat</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaded his tanned forehead, and he clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the desk as if for support.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wendell's eyes raked their features, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts going back to the ghastly shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had followed him through the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this very house. It had been inhuman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful. What was even more significant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was without a face! Could that strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape be the very thing these two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so afraid of--the corpse of Philip</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drayton, animated by some unholy power</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger than death, creeping through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness to fulfill its vow of revenge?</seg><seg type="columnLine">A corpse trying to commit murder! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fantastic. A dead man seeking ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geance on the living! Reason and logic</seg><seg type="columnLine">rebelled against such an impossibility.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And yet. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">With an effort Wendell shook off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eerie mood that gripped him, handed back</seg><seg type="columnLine">the notes. "What about the two other</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who received these threatening let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters--Brant and Shaw?" he asked abrupt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. "Where are they now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I--I invited them to come here to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night," Benton faltered.

Suddenly a voice was scream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing--the voice of a man driven insane</seg><seg type="columnLine">with horror and fear. Muffled, terrible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it sounded inside the room, seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from the wall itself!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Mercy!" it shrieked.

Mercy--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The voice rose to a frenzied screech,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped abruptly.

A form bobbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in the dimness, swaying a little with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ghastly simulation of life. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of a dead man, dangling from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hook in the wall like the carcass of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheep hanging in a butcher shop. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dave Wendell felt black sickness churn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and twisting in his stomach as he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hideous way death had struck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The head and face of the man who hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">there before him was entirely bare of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh, as though picked clean by vultures!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only the skull remained, naked white</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone, with not even a vestige of skin or</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair clinging to it!

He turned away with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shudder, to explore every square inch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the closet space. He rapped on floor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls with his knuckles, pressed onto</seg><seg type="columnLine">panelling, but his search was fruitless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aside from the dangling body, the closet</seg><seg type="columnLine">was absolutely empty, its walls solid!</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no sign of the murderer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no evidence of any secret passageway</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which he might have escaped!</seg><seg type="columnLine">There wasn't even a clue to the grisly</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon he had used to mutilate his vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tim's face so horribly! Whoever--what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever--had killed Melvin Shaw had van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished utterly without a trace!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wendell spun around unsteadily to</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare at the pallid, stricken men behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "Well?" he grated. "What do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">two know about this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Paul Lambert moistened his dry lips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Drayton did it!" he choked. "He killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shaw just as he threatened he would!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He murdered him while we were standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">here talking--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"But if Drayton did it, how did he get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away afterward?" Wendell interrupted</seg><seg type="columnLine">harshly. "There's only one exit from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">closet--through the door leading into</seg><seg type="columnLine">this room! Drayton couldn't have made</seg><seg type="columnLine">his escape that way! He couldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in the closet at all--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"But he was in there!" Benton panted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We heard Shaw talking to him, didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">we? We heard the poor fellow begging</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his life! And then Drayton--or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that was Drayton--murdered him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disappeared before we could open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">closet door! I tell you, Wendell, we're up</seg><seg type="columnLine">against something inhuman--something</seg><seg type="columnLine">with unearthly powers! Something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">can vanish through solid walls as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they didn't exist!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nuts!" the detective muttered. "Ghost</seg><seg type="columnLine">or no ghost, the killer's going to have a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hard time pulling a vanishing act when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we get him behind iron bars!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But his words lacked conviction. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more he felt superstitious terror plucking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his nerves, threatening his self-control.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once more he was battling, fighting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst of all fears--fear of the unknown!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had heard a man screaming behind a</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed door. Barely five seconds later he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had jerked open that door to find the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">man a hideously mutilated corpse! Five</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds for some fiendish killer to strip</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flesh from that man's face and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear as if into thin air! It was all so</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly fantastic and impossible. It could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have happened!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, it couldn't have happened," Wen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dell mumbled to himself. "It must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been done in some other way." He wiped</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the sweat forming on his forehead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Benton again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Were you and Lambert at home all</seg><seg type="columnLine">day?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton looked puzzled, then shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. "We spent most of the afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a museum," he said. "We were exam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ining a collection of insects in the natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">history department--■"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"And I don't suppose you opened this</seg><seg type="columnLine">closet after you came back ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"No. We had no occasion to. We sel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom use it--" Benton broke off suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face going livid. "What are you driv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at, Wendell?" he-gasped. "Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean that the murderer--that Drayton--</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought Shaw to this house while Paul</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I were away, forced him to go into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that closet? Do you mean that both of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them might have been in there since this</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's quite possible that Shaw might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been, at least. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"But even so, that doesn't explain why</seg><seg type="columnLine">the murderer delayed killing Shaw until</seg><seg type="columnLine">just now!

"What</seg><seg type="columnLine">did Shaw mean by screaming, 7 don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have it! Brant's the one who does!' just</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he died? What was that thing he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't have and the killer wanted? Have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you any idea, Benton?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I don't know," Benton said hastily. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">--I couldn't even guess." But his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't ring true, and he refused to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the detective's eyes. Could the man be</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying, keeping something back? "You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to ask Professor Brant," he added</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'm going to," Wendell said grimly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And right away. What's Brant's ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress?" He scribbled it down, turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trembling secretary. "Call the police,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lambert," he ordered. "I'll be back as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as I can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But you can't leave us alone," Benton</seg><seg type="columnLine">whimpered. "You've got to stay here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">protect us! Brant will be along in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes anyway. He said he would--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Brant will never keep that engage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment with you," Wendell interrupted</seg><seg type="columnLine">harshly. "If he isn't dead now he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be soon! The police will take care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and Lambert, Benton. I've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">warn John Brant before the killer gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Even now I may be too late!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He heard Benton's despairing cry be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him, Lambert frenziedly telephon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing police headquarters. Then he was out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the house, racing down the street to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner. He hailed a cruising taxi,</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Professor Brant's residence, 300 Olive</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street," he panted. "And step on it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER THREE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Crawling Death!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flTHE driver made good time. Scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten minutes later they stopped with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeal of brakes in front of a brownstone</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. Wendell tossed the hackman a five-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollar bill, raced up the walk without wait-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for his change. The front door was</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly ajar. He pushed it open, entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dark, shadowy hall. Light sifted out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him through drawn curtains hanging be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore a room to his left. Cautiously Dave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wendell crept toward the source of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. He yanked the curtains apart, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coiled with a sick gasp of horror at what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Near the doorway lay the body of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, legs bent, hands clenched even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">death in a spasm of agony. The face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone--obliterated! As in the case of Mel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vin Shaw, the flesh had been stripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, leaving only a bone-white skull</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose jaws yawned open as if in silent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hellish laughter! And bending over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous corpse, frantically searching its</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets, was the slim figure of a girl!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wendell must have made some sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for suddenly she jerked erect and whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him. For a moment she stood perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless and rigid. Then a strangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry broke from her lips and she cowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, eyes dilated with terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The detective reached for his revolver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leveled it at her menacingly. "Sorry to</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupt your little murder party," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said grimly. "But I think the police would</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to have a talk with you. That," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestured toward the thing on the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"was Professor John Brant, I take it ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl nodded, her face a white, frozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask. "But I didn't do it," she whispered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I didn't kill him. I--I don't even know</seg><seg type="columnLine">who did.

Wendell's lip curled. "Just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">common, little thief, robbing a dead man ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angry color flamed in her cheeks. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time he noticed how pretty she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. "I'm not a thief!" she cried furi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously. "I was only after something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't belong to him--something he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my husband. Something that means</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything in the world to Phil!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Phil?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Philip Drayton, I mean.

Philip Drayton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to George Benton's story, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">died six months ago in South America!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philip Drayton, or so Benton said, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come back from the grave to exact a ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible vengeance on four men who had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to a horrible fate! Two of those men</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already been murdered, dying as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drayton was supposed to have died, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a face! And now here was this lovely</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, who said she was Drayton's wife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching the pockets of one of Drayton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">victims, looking for something she claimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant everything in the world to her for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer husband! What in this world could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be important to a dead man anymore ? It</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't make sense!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let's get this straight," Wendell said</seg><seg type="columnLine">feebly. "First of all, what is this 'some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing'1 you want so badly?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl's lips set in a thin line. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of your business," she said defiantly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But if it isn't on Brant's body," her voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardened, "one of the others must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.

Wendell rasped. "I don't think so!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not if I can help it, at any rate!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Murder?" she gasped. "But I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder anyone! I just told you I--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her voice broke off suddenly and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lief flooded over her face as she caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of someone over the detective's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. "Philip!" she cried joyfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thank God you're here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The rank odor of kerosene, more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">what she said, warned Dave Wendell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horror that lurked behind him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled around, his blood turning to ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his veins. One split-second glimpse he</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught of the inhuman shape that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">trailed him to George Benton's house ear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lier that evening--the ghastly, faceless</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature that must be the corpse of Philip</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Drayton! Then a club in the thing's hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept up and descended with crushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">force on his head. Crimson lights whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and danced in front of his eyes. Pain ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploded inside his skull, snuffing out con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness as a strong wind snuffs out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">candle. ...</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TT SEEMED hours later when Dave</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wendell opened dull, suffering eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more. He was sprawled on the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his revolver lying a few inches away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his outstretched fingers. With the excep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the mutilated body of John Brant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was alone in the room. Both the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the faceless thing had vanished!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wendell staggered to his feet, picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his revolver. Drums of agony boomed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side his head. He rubbed a shaking hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his aching forehead," tried to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight. The thing without a face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind these murders. He was positive</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that now. Whether it was human or in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">human, a living creature or a corpse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't matter. It was killing, destroying</seg><seg type="columnLine">life!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl must be its accomplice! She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had declared that she knew nothing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the murders, but she must have been lying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She and the thing had already killed two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men--Melvin Shaw and John Brant!</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would kill two more--George Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton and Paul Lambert--unless they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He'd stop them! He'd save Benton and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lambert! With that determination seeth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in his brain, Wendell stumbled from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room and out into the night air. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could never recall afterward how or when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reached Benton's home. The next thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">he remembered was running up the path</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the house, dark and silent as a tomb.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even before he burst through the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">door he knew death had preceded him!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even before he rushed into the library, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew he would be too late!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The body of a man lay there in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desk. Like the bodies of the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terror Has No Face</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">who had died that night, it was hideously</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutilated, the face and head stripped clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flesh! But by the clothing it wore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wendell identified it as the corpse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paul Lambert. Lambert who had died,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, without a face! Lambert who was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third to be hunted down and murdered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfy a dead man's lust for vengeance!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But where was Benton, the fourth vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tim marked for slaughter? There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of him in the room! Had he escaped ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And why weren't the police there? Lam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bert had telephoned them to come! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been calling them when Wendell</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed away 011 that wild goose chase to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brant's home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Or had Lambert called the police ? With</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inarticulate cry, Wendell leaped for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephone, snatched it up. Dangling wires</seg><seg type="columnLine">trailed across the desk as he lifted the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strument ! The killer had made the phone</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless so that Lambert couldn't get help</seg><seg type="columnLine">that might have saved his life!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wendell returned to the corpse, knelt</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside it. Lambert had been dead only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes; his flesh was still warm to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the touch. The detective got to his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brow furrowed in thought. Significant</seg><seg type="columnLine">happenings of that night of horror whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a stream of lurid pictures through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. He recalled the two ominous notes</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had read that evening. He thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">another corpse he had seen. He remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered a man screaming in terrible fear--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man who was found dead and hideously</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutilated seconds afterward. These frag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of a jigsaw of mystery should form</seg><seg type="columnLine">a completed pattern of crime if only he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could put them together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Again Wendell was at the desk, run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning his fingers underneath its edge. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened up finally, waited. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a voice was shrieking in the room once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more--a voice so muffled and terrible that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it froze the blood with horror. "Mercy!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">it shrieked. "Dear God, have mercy! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't have it! I don't have it, I tell you!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brant's the one who does! He's the man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you want! Kill me if you want! But not</seg><seg type="columnLine">like this! Mercy--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was Melvin Shaw's voice! Shaw had</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed those same words once before!</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Shaw was dead--his corpse dangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a hook in the closet! Dave Wendell</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pale and shaking as he listened. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment later he smiled grimly as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous voice rose to a nerve-tearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">screech, and rasped away into silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"As simple as all that!" he muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud. "Just a recording of Shaw's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">--what a fool I was not to spot it! What</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fool to let the real murderer escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I had my hands on him! But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be still in the house! And this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tricks won't help him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Whirling, the detective went plunging</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the hall. The other rooms in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house were dark. They were vacant, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wendell switched on lights as he ran. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the kitchen, stopped in front of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">door leading into the cellar. Dim light</seg><seg type="columnLine">filtered up to him as he opened the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down below the killer must be lurking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparing his next move in this desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">game of life and death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Cautiously Wendell descended the stair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">case. His hand was thrust deep in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket, gripping the butt on his revolver.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He reached the concrete floor of the cellar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and moved across it on tiptoe. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no trace of the killer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But on a table in the center of the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a transparent, circular object that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected the light--a huge, glass jar. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside that jar was a dark ball that moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swayed with hideous life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WTENDELL'S breath was frozen vapor</seg><seg type="columnLine">' *, in his lungs as he drew nearer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw what that living ball was. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made up of dark moving bodies, millions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tiny insects. They were vicious South</seg><seg type="columnLine">American ants, the vilest scourge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropics! They devoured everything that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unfortunate enough to be in their way</seg><seg type="columnLine">--leaves, plants, other insects, and living</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures many times their size! All ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals even man, fled in terror at their ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proach! They were more to be dreaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the most savage beast that roamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">This, then, was the hideous murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon the killer had devised! There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wooden bottom to the jar, and, in it, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole large enough to admit a man's head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once fastened in there, the victim's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be exposed to the ants. They would</seg><seg type="columnLine">devour skin, flesh--everything, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but grinning bone behind! This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was why three men had died--without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">face! No wonder Melvin Shaw had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">screame3 in horror when he saw what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be his fate!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Sick, nauseated, Dave Wendell stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the swarming insect horrors. So fasci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated was he that he failed to notice that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">door was opening inch by inch at the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the cellar. He didn't hear a black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">furtive shape creep from its hiding place</seg><seg type="columnLine">and start silently toward him. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of no danger until a vicious blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the side of his head with terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">force. Arrows of anguish shot through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain. He felt hideous darkness envelop</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He felt his limbs turn to rubber, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor rushed up to meet him as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell____</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Consciousness returned to Dave Wen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dell slowly, consciousness filled with agon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">izing pain. His head throbbed excruciat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly, and there was the flat taste of blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his mouth. He groaned, opened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. He was lying on the floor, bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and foot. Near him stood the shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">owy figure, watching him through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slitted eye-holes in its masked face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You should be punished for interfer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with my plans, David Wendell," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure droned. "But I am inclined to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">merciful. I am succeeding in what I set</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to do in spite of you. I have already</seg><seg type="columnLine">revenged myself on Melvin Shaw, John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brant, and Paul Lambert for the wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did me! There remains only--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Stop it!" Wendell cried hoarsely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're just wasting your breath by try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to feed me that nonsense! I know the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole cursed scheme! I know who you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are and the reason for your hellish</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Really?" A snarling note crept into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gloating voice. "In that case it may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to include you in my list of</seg><seg type="columnLine">victims, after all! But go on, Wendell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You interest me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">An icy wind seemed to blow through</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dave Wendell as he caught the menace</seg><seg type="columnLine">underlying the masked fiend's words. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew too much. He was in the way. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less a miracle happened, he would meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same hideous end as the others. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready the insect horrors were scurrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">around more rapidly in their glass cage as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if scenting the flesh of another victim!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, I understand the whole devilish</seg><seg type="columnLine">plot now," Wendell continued, sparring</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately for time. "I know what really</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to Philip Drayton on that expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition to South America. You wanted me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to believe you had been forced to leave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind when you fled from an Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack, didn't you? But that was a lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cover up your own guilt! You and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others did leave Drayton behind--but to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate infinitely more horrible than anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tribe of savages might have done to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You tied him up in the path of an army</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ants, knowing what would happen when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insects reached him, planning to mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der him by the same means you used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder your three accomplices tonight!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have no proof of that, of course. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am just as positive you did it as if I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been there to watch you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"But why did you and the others wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">to murder Drayton? There could be only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one motive--greed for wealth. Drayton</seg><seg type="columnLine">had something the rest of you wanted--</seg><seg type="columnLine">something so valuable you were deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined to kill him to get it. Something, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out a short time ago, that was small</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to be concealed in a man's pocket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terror Has No Face</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">61</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">What could be so tiny and still be of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such value that you would commit mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der to possess it? Only one thing--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewel of some sort, a precious stone. ..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER FOUR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Mask of Horror</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">66'V7'OU'RE much too clever, Wendell,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the masked figure snarled. "Too</seg><seg type="columnLine">clever for your own good. You're right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drayton was left in the jungle for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants to devour him. He did have a pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious stone--a diamond known as the 'Eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Light' and worth a small fortune. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was given to the poor fool by a rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brazilian whose life he happened to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">while we were in Rio de Janeiro. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment I saw that diamond I knew I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have it for my own. The money I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">get from selling it would leave me in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable circumstances for the rest of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">days. And I did get it at last! I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">it now--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I thought so," Wendell interrupted</seg><seg type="columnLine">harshly. "But it didn't really come into</seg><seg type="columnLine">your possession until tonight, did it ? For</seg><seg type="columnLine">after you and the others robbed Drayton</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the diamond and disposed of him, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewel disappeared. You found out then</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was no honor among thieves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">let alone murderers! You knew one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your three accomplices had stolen it, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you weren't sure just which one. And so</seg><seg type="columnLine">you thought of a scheme that would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only frighten the thief into giving up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">diamond, but would also eliminate him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and your two other confederates so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proceeds from the sale of the jewel</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be yours alone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ironically enough, you decided to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philip Drayton in that scheme. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and your three partners in crime left</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drayton to die in the jungle, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed threats after you, vowed he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would find a way to get even. You knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">your accomplices remembered those</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">threats. If you could convince them that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drayton actually had come back from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead for his revenge, you could break</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the nerve of whichever one had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolen the diamond to such an extent that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be only too glad to give it up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once the diamond was in your possession,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you could murder all three of your con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">federates and pin the blame on a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">man!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"And you did it well. You started your</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror build-up by imitating Drayton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">handwriting in the notes you sent to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">victims, warning them they were going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">die as he had died--without a face. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">also mailed one to yourself, of course, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep them from suspecting you. And since</seg><seg type="columnLine">you lived in the same house with one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your intended victims, you got your note</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time he got his and could study</seg><seg type="columnLine">his reaction. You pretended to be just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as panic-stricken as he was, even agreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him that I, a detective, should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">called in as a protective measure. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the police were bound to find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was going on anyhow, and hoped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">convince them through me that a super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural influence was actually at work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You did go to a museum this after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon. But you didn't stay there long, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you wanted me to believe. You slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">away after a short time and went to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shaw, your first victim. You brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">him here, compelled him to enter this cel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar with you. Then"--Wendell shuddered</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he glanced again at the hideous, swarm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing death in the glass jar--"you showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poor wretch the murder weapon you</seg><seg type="columnLine">had devised to carry out the threat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">those letters. You had brought the colony</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ants in that jar from South America</seg><seg type="columnLine">for just such a purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Shaw went crazy with terror when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out what was going to happen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He vowed he hadn't stolen the dia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mond, accused Brant of taking it instead..</seg><seg type="columnLine">You let him rave on for a little while</seg><seg type="columnLine">before you killed him. You had rigged up</seg><seg type="columnLine">62</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a dictaphone outfit in the cellar which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was making a record of what he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You figured even then that you might</seg><seg type="columnLine">need such a device to pull the wool over</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes a little later on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"When the ants were finished with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shaw, you went after Brant next. Wrap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping up the glass jar so that no one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell what it contained, you drove with it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Brant's house. But before you mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered him, you found out he didn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the diamond either. Only one person</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have it--the third man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped you take it from the original owner</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You had gone with that man to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">museum earlier in the afternoon. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still there, not knowing that death had</seg><seg type="columnLine">already struck down his two companions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You rushed back here then to set the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage for the performance tonight. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged Shaw's corpse up from the cellar</seg><seg type="columnLine">and put it in the closet. Concealing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dictaphone record of the dead man's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind a bookcase near the closet, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected it with an electric switch under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the edge of the desk. You could</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand beside the desk and start the record</seg><seg type="columnLine">without anyone noticing what you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing. You were all ready now for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little drama of horror you played this</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"And I swallowed the bait you had set</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me, hook, line and sinker," Wendell</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on bitterly. "When you clicked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the switch and I heard Shaw's voice ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently coming from the closet, I reacted</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as you hoped I would. I thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, that someone was in the closet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Shaw, murdering him. And when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">yanked open the door and found the poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil's body hanging in there, that belief</seg><seg type="columnLine">was intensified. Your little trick helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">you in two ways. In the first place, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave you an ironclad alibi, since obviously</seg><seg type="columnLine">you couldn't have just killed Shaw when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you weren't even close to him. Second-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, it sent me racing out of the house in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">foolish attempt to save Brant who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already dead, leaving the third victim of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your hellish scheme completely at your</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercy!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I didn't get wise to you until I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back here again from my wild-goose chase</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Brant's house," Wendell continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">harshly. "Then when I found the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your last victim lying in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk and the telephone wires cut, I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to smell a rat. Why should a super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural killer need to take the precaution</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cutting telephone wires so that its vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tim couldn't call for help ? I remembered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, that Shaw's body had felt cold when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I touched it, instead of being warm as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have been if he had just been mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered. I knew then that both he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brant had been killed hours before and</seg><seg type="columnLine">your alibi wasn't worth a nickle. I pried</seg><seg type="columnLine">around a little bit more and discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">how you had apparently made Shaw talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">long after his death. Those murders</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't been committed by an inhuman</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, the corpse of a dead man avenging</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old wrong! No, a human agency was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at work: you, a fiendishly clever murderer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who would stop at nothing to accomplish</seg><seg type="columnLine">your purpose!

"After</seg><seg type="columnLine">you left for Brant's home, my last victim</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to pieces completely and confessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had stolen the diamond. He surren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered it to me and began to plead for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. But my little pets soon stopped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">yammering, the damned, sniveling thief!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was getting ready to destroy the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">criminating evidence--the murder weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had used and the dictaphone record of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shaw's voice--when you interrupted me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You just gave me time to hide in the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the cellar when you came rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">down here. But though you've discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">who I am, I'll still get out of this mess</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terror Has No Face</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">63</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with a whole skin, Wendell! I'll still save</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hide--by killing you! And I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well use the same weapon on you I used</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the others--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You can't get away with it!" Wen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dell cried hoarsely. "You needed me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove your alibi! The police are sure to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find you out now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't be stupid, Wendell," the robed</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure chuckled. "I don't need an alibi!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The police will never dream I committed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the murders, and you know it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">How true that was, Wendell realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitterly. The fiend would escape and never</seg><seg type="columnLine">be punished! If only he could stall the</seg><seg type="columnLine">killer off a little while longer! The masked</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape had lifted the terrible glass jar, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming toward him with it. Inside it, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark ball burst into a thousand scurrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrors, ready to devour his lips, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue, his eyelids, strip the raw, red flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his skull! Sweating, panting, Wen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dell struggled with his bonds. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving slightly, but not enough for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach the revolver in his pocket. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed just a little more time! Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">must happen to stop the murderer for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few more seconds!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And something did! Suddenly the stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading down the cellar creaked ominous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. A thing was descending those stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a thing of horror! It was gaunt, hideous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">faceless--the corpse of a dead man! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpse of Philip Drayton, returning at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last for its revenge! Slowly, remorselessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">it drew nearer the fiend who had murdered</seg><seg type="columnLine">it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The masked man must have heard that</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow approach, for he whirled around to</seg><seg type="columnLine">confront the horror stealing upon him. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">jangling scream rasped from his lips and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass jar with its awful contents</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped from his fingers and splintered</seg><seg type="columnLine">into fragments on the floor. Whimper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, crazed with fear, he cowered back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking from head to foot, his red-rimmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes rolling wildly in their sockets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You have come back!" he bleated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You have made good your vow! No, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't be! It can't be! Stay away from me!</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the love of God, stay away from me!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thing that had been Philip Drayton</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't answer. It was as though death</seg><seg type="columnLine">had robbed it of speech. In ghastly silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">it continued on, fleshless jaws open in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarl of hate, skeleton fingers shaping into</seg><seg type="columnLine">claws to bury themselves in the masked</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure's throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"No!" the fiend screamed again. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed you once! I'll try again, make sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time! If the ants didn't finish you in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle, a bullet will now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The murderer was pawing wildly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side his coat, striving to jerk out a gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Wendell's hands were free at last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own revolver in his fingers. Orange</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame stabbed suddenly through the gloom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cellar. The masked figure shrieked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">weaved back and forth uncertainly, crum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pled in a grotesque heap to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Swiftly Wendell untied the thongs</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his ankles, bent for a moment over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the form of the murderer. "Too bad my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet only stunned him," he muttered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But perhaps it's just as well. The electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair will be a better punishment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The detective straightened up, turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the hideous creature behind him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw now that the thing's features weren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">so badly mutilated as he had supposed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Enough of the face was left to indicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">that its owner had once been handsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">and manly and young. A girl had entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cellar and was standing beside it now</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the same girl Wendell had seen at John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brant's home a short time before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The detective went toward them, gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing's hand. "Thank God you came</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you did, Drayton," he said fervent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. "You saved me from a horrible death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You"--he hesitated as he forced himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look again at that ghastly remnant of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a face--"you weren't killed in the jungle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the girl who answered. "Philip</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't talk very well yet," she explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">64</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">huskily. "No, he wasn't killed as his en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">emies thought he had been. He was res-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cued by a tribe of friendly Indians be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the ants finished him. But even now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hasn't fully recovered from his terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience. Even now"--her voice broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">--"he imagines the awful insects are still</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling on him and insists on dousing</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself with kerosene. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I understand," Wendell said gently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've heard that people in tropical coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tries use kerosene to keep the horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">little beasts away. I"--he tried to grin--"I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wishing for some kerosene myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary Drayton shuddered and drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer to her husband as she glanced at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscious form of the murderer on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor. "And to think George Benton</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned all this," she whispered. "To</seg><seg type="columnLine">think any man could be so cruel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiendish--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Benton?" Wendell interrupted. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't Benton." He stooped once more over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black-clad figure, ripped off the mask.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thin, tanned features beneath were</seg><seg type="columnLine">distorted with fear and rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WpAUL LAMBERT!" the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">panted. "I--I can't believe it! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw his body--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"That was George Benton's body you</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw upstairs in the library," Dave Wen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dell said grimly. "Planting Benton's corpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">there to be mistaken for his own was an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other of Lambert's tricks to keep every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one from finding out he was the murder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er. He killed Benton, destroyed his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prevent recognition. He then changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes with the dead man, knowing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton's body would pass for his, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were both approximately the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">height and weight. Lambert, you see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't sure he could convince the police</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a supernatural killer had committed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the murders. But he figured he could still</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a clean getaway by having it appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he himself was a victim of the killer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">With Paul Lambert apparently dead, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could take the diamond he had schemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">so hard to get, adopt an assumed name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and go to another country where he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never be suspected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I fell for his gag myself at first,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wendell continued harshly. "Then I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered the two threatening letters Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton had showed me earlier in the evening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The one Benton had received was worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and frayed, indicating it had worked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nerves so much that he had looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it countless times during the day. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other note--Lambert's--had hardly been</seg><seg type="columnLine">handled at all. In other words, Lambert</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't been terrified by the ominous warn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in those letters because he was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">author of them himself. I recalled, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how Lambert had hung around the desk</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the time, waiting to turn on the record</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had made of Shaw's voice. I knew then</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Lambert was the killer, saw through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the devices he had used to shift suspi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cion away from himself. . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Letters ?" Mary Drayton gasped. "De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vices? I--I don't understand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Briefly Wendell explained to her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her husband the part of Lambert's scheme</seg><seg type="columnLine">they hadn't heard. "The whole thing origi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated in the brain of a madman, driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">insane with greed," he added. "Thank God</seg><seg type="columnLine">he didn't succeed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He bent again over the killer as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked, found a hidden pocket inside of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat. He drew out a small, square box,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flipped open the lid. Inside, on a mound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cotton, rested a magnificent gem, glit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering, sparkling with dazzling radiance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the diamond, the "Eye of Light"!</seg><seg type="columnLine">But there was something sinister about</seg><seg type="columnLine">its loveliness, something evil in its cold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scintillating beauty. Because of it three</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had died. Because of it still another</seg><seg type="columnLine">man--Paul Lambert--must go to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">death in the electric chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, it is evil," Dave Wendell mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mured. "And yet good sometimes comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of evil." He turned to Mary Drayton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terror Has No Face</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">65</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">saw her slim fingers tremble as he put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great jewel in her hand. "I think I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">now why you wanted it so badly," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly. "I think I know why you told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me it meant everything in the world to</seg><seg type="columnLine">your husband. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"We need it to make Philip look like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">human being again," she whispered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We've consulted a plastic surgeon who</seg><seg type="columnLine">is sure he can restore Philip's face through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long series of treatment.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">added a snake-like writhing of her supple</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, then her contortions became still</seg><seg type="columnLine">more abandoned as her stomach muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuddered and she slowly rose to her feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying and undulating to the sensuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhythm of the music.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then, each part of her body continuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">its unique, provocative motion, she slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">began to bend over the amphora; through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheer pantaloons could be seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunching of her thighs from the pull of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowering torso. Then her hand snaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to unstopper the amphora--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly stopped!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Her eyes widened with fear, a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread seemed to grip her. Yet it was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly overcome by her trouper's instinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go on that the pause was nearly im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceptible. Quickly she composed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, reached down, unstoppered the am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phora. And then I felt it--something evil,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something malign, something that came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of hell through the narrow neck of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sinister bottle!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The very air seemed to throb with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible destructive force. But when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed my gaze over those near me, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">no surprise or fear.

But any emotion she might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have felt was now well under control and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she continued to dance smoothly as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtain of smoke steadily rose before her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, as it suddenly thickened, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely hidden from view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I breathed a sigh of relief; the scene was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and nothing had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But why didn't Bogolowski yell, "Cut!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cameras still ground at that opaque</seg><seg type="columnLine">greyness and my forebodings returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly as it seemed suddenly to stir with</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, to gather into a myriad of ectoplasmic</seg><seg type="columnLine">globules that shifted and writhed and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">formed fantastic shapes and swiftly chang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing patterns. For a second, it seemed, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">illusion persisted and then there was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke again, settling and thinning, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealing . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> God! I can still hear the screams that</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose, the hoarse cries, the horrified</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouts.

"That scene can be taken as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">medium long shot and if we keep the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the girl taking Miss Ladd's place away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the camera, there need be only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">superficial resemblance." He hesitated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We have such a person in Miss Boyne."</seg><seg type="columnLine">A faint gasp came from Mary and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was already half out of my chair to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">test when Gold swept on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may be sure I would not suggest</seg><seg type="columnLine">this," he. urged, "if I felt I were placing</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone in danger.

That was my chill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing thought as Abou Malik's warning ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">through my brain again in an insidious</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper: "It is dangerous to trifle with</seg><seg type="columnLine">these things. I wished he had returned, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I could ask what he thought of this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A girl killed without a sound heard or</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything but a patch of smoke seen by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">score of people within a dozen feet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her...</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"As for any other idea," Gold continued,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though he read my thoughts, "a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not torn--is not killed without human</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands touching her. In a few minutes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">film of that scene will be developed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can look at the rushes. The inexpli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cable will be explained, I am sure, by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camera's less emotional eye . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He was right, I supposed, and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no right to deny Mary this chance. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was eager for it, now that she had gotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her reluctance to double for a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl. Yet I could not shake off my dread,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not keep from feeling that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was some connection between Claire</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ladd's death and the sinister amphora.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But at least that scene was done; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">amphora was not used in the one in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary would play. A little ashamed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus admitting to myself that I did fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing, I was still glad that Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have to perform the ritualistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance of invoking the jinni.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then it was that one of the men from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the developing room rushed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd, caught Gold as he was walking off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the set. His agitated whisper cut through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sudden silence: "The film must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been exposed. There was nothing on it!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gold swore, groans rose, Bogolowski</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed, "Then we're licked!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm damned if we are!" shouted Gold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We'll still finish this picture today!" A</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of approval went up as he issued his</seg><seg type="columnLine">order: "If it takes all night, shoot both</seg><seg type="columnLine">scenes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Only then did the full significance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this accident strike me. Mary must re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">peat the dance that had brought Claire</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ladd a strange and brutal death I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tpOR three hours Bogolowski rehearsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary in the dance, and for three hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">I struggled with a dilemma that kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing more frightening but never be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came clearer. Unquestionably Gold was</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and any other attitude was insane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But there was still this horrible thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to torture me: if the other, the incredible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were true--Mary was doomed! I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">risk it.. r</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the end, my change of feeling came</seg><seg type="columnLine">about paradoxically. Abou Malik sudden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly was walking beside me as I paced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor nervously. Into my hand he thrust a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth, dark object--like an amulet with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out any inscription. "A charm against cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain evils," he said and quickly left my</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. An instant later his tall figure passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the building out onto the lot. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly I felt very foolish; his melo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dramatic manner and his "charm" had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cured me of my ridiculous fears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But when they were ready for the take,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went to the stand at the side of the set,</seg><seg type="columnLine">near Mary but out of range of the cameras.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was just a precautionary measure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had satisfied myself that there were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap doors in the stage floor, but I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to stand where I could see behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen of smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then the take began and I was quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost in admiration at Mary's performance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It did not have the heavy sensuality of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Claire Ladd's, but it seemed to strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer to the meaning of the dance. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually seemed a devotee of some ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult, sincerely supplicating the jinni to</seg><seg type="columnLine">manifest himself. That ring of authenticity</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbed the dance of all obscenity and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she rose from the first kneeling position</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the amphora and her whole undu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lating body was revealed, I felt that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more than wanton exhibitionism.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There seemed a real ritualistic significance</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the devotional, entreating gesture with</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which she unstoppered the evil amphora.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I felt it again--some emanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">that spread from the amphora in great</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful surges! Yet it was different</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time, different in a way I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">characterize until suddenly, as if in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponse to it, a wave of sheer wantonness</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to sweep over Mary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In a second she seemed to have a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">lavishly endowed, more provocatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped body than Claire Ladd's. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements of that body changed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time, became slower but stronger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more stirring, seeming to pick up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce, deliberate rhythm of passion's own</seg><seg type="columnLine">surge!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">One part of my brain said that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">only been caught up by the spirit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance. The other shrieked that a demonia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal spirit had found her pleasing, that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was responding to his demand, giving her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to a fate worse than Claire Ladd's!</seg><seg type="columnLine">God! Why didn't I listen to it and stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">her before it was too late? But I poor fool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew my thoughts were mad; I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoil the take, which would be over in</seg><seg type="columnLine">another minute, now that the smoke was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising before Mary. And, from where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood at the side, I could see that no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">else, nothing else, stood behind the thick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening curtain a foot in front of her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She was safe, I told myself; the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty was with my imagination. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke once more seemed to be gathering</seg><seg type="columnLine">into misty shapes that swirled in exotic</seg><seg type="columnLine">patterns and strove avidly to press against</seg><seg type="columnLine">her body. And she seemed to shudder with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecstasy; her thighs trembled, her soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist swelled and flattened with her heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing, her whole body began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremble--as if in the amorous embrace of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lover! God! I was able to endure it only</seg><seg type="columnLine">because I knew it was smoke I was seeing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And there was a definite space between it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mary. As two separated things I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see her pulsing white body and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtain of smoke. Two separate things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see them both.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And then I could see only one! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">madly gyrating smoke. Before my very</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, Mary had disappeared--as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been erased . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rT1HE huge, giddy clouds of multi-colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">A light that filled the sky slowly receded</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into my own brain and then I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was walking along upper Holly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood Boulevard. It was nearly midnight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the five hours since I had left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">studio were a blank to me. I remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first consternation when the lowering</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke had shown the others what I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">already, the panic that had ensued as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruitless search went on; the police, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions, the discovery that again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">films were mysteriously spoiled; Bogolow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ski arguing with Gold, who had been called</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, and at last convincing him that noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing could now be done to finish the picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">on schedule; everyone being kind to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">as together we left the lot for what I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be the last time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I was alone, thinking of it for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time, and I remembered no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And now my thoughts began to spin in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanely again as I faced the incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth--Mary was gone! Gone to the em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brace of a creature of hell-born desires</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deathly corruption!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I fought for a saner view but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult. Claire Ladd was one matter;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were ways, even if I could not say</seg><seg type="columnLine">how, that she could have been killed. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary had vanished into thin air! And be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore she had disappeared with my eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon her, I had felt the perverting power</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the amphora, seen Mary's passionate</seg><seg type="columnLine">response to the embrace of an invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">lover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps my subconscious mind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">directing my stumbling feet for I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly to the Eldorado lot when the wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought came to me. Where would Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">be but in the grotto where the jinni was</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed to have transported her?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was insane, but as I broke into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Love Me--And Perish!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">run I was cackling gleefully. To my shaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind the thought seemed perfectly logical</seg><seg type="columnLine">and evident. Even after I had let myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the gates and was flying past the</seg><seg type="columnLine">false-fronted buildings of a frontier town</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed by an English Village, down a</seg><seg type="columnLine">street in Montmartre at whose end stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">a plaster Taj Mahal, and round a corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a section of the U. S. Navy Yard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it did not seem incongruous that on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hollywood movie lot I should be seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lair of a demon out of the legendary</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arabian Nights. I slowed up as I passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the studio building where the weird affair</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had its beginning. Quietly I opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door of the adjoining studio, crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the end where the artificial grotto</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been built.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was only partly roofed and as I en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered its narrow mouth, far ahead I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the pale moonlight that pierced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skylight of the building. I went toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">it over a thick carpet of moss and gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally I made out the monstrous figures in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cised on the wall, the huge rocks at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grotto's end. Then, standing beside them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw Mary! Exactly as I had seen her</seg><seg type="columnLine">last; with one sweep I took in everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her half-closed eyes to the unmarred</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty of her profiled figure in the flimsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">costume that was not even rumpled. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unharmed, had not been touched!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">An exultant cry rose to my lips--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">was never uttered. Mary had tilted back</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head, lifted her lips, extended her arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">--as if in invitation! But no one else was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Incredulously, I watched her torso arch</seg><seg type="columnLine">provocatively, her body sway forward. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not understand. Against this screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light there was nothing visible except</seg><seg type="columnLine">her body, standing out in fine detail. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was seeking an embrace, begging ca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly the silk taut over the curve of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her breast was indented--by the print of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man's hand! The print but not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand ...</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DERHAPS I hadn't really been con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced until that second. All I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">is that with that physical evidence of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hell-born being who was material yet in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible, fear closed over my heart and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chilled its beating. My breath oozed out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my strength trickled away. The jinni</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually stood before Mary! The jinni,</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible, yet capable of dimpling Mary's</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast with the touch of his hand, capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fondling her, of--God! It was the hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror of that thought which rooted me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground, made me look upon the weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooing as though in a trance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The separate indentations made by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster's fingers slid together and I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see her soft flesh firming at the touch--</seg><seg type="columnLine">flattening, suddenly under a pressure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be seen! An ecstatic shudder</seg><seg type="columnLine">rippled Mary's body and she inched for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, her arms curving about empty space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if enfolding a material lover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  My own hoarse shout snapped me out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my trance and I lurched forward awk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wardly. What happened in the next split-</seg><seg type="columnLine">second seemed composed of many separate</seg><seg type="columnLine">events. Mary stiffened, started to turn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A form shot past me. Mary's turn was</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrested and the cloth across her waist</seg><seg type="columnLine">tautened, as if a restraining arm had en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled her. The figure ahead of me</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, whirled, faced me. I saw Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gold!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The first thought that flashed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind was that Gold, though he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no conceivable motive, had staged this</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole weird affair, that I had been mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken in what I believed I had just seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I looked at Mary again and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">provocative expression and sensuous ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures could allow only one meaning. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">jinni did exist!

In the dim light</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see his eyes were black with hate</seg><seg type="columnLine">72</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and in his hand--he held a revolver!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"My God!"

It was coming, coming quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as my eyes darted to Mary for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">last look. She was turned toward us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer could I see the imprints of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible hands on her! But her eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifting, as if watching something stalk</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward us . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard a click. The revolver was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocked!

And without a hand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be seen touching his throat he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gag and his eyes bulged monstrously in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a face that quickly turned livid, then black!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Something that had been pushed far</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in my mind made me plunge my hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">into my pocket for a small object there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was forgotten again in the horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what I next saw. Suddenly, as if re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased from support, Gold's body crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor, jerked convulsively once and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still, while from his mouth and nostrils</seg><seg type="columnLine">gushed rich claret blood.

Iron bands bound my chest and each</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath of air I sucked into my lungs was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a searing flame. My head pounded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the excruciating pain deep inside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, waves of blackness rolled up over my</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain. This, I thought, is the end . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But I was to live for a far greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The pressure subsided and though I</seg><seg type="columnLine">retched violently I did not lose conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.

Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood when suddenly I saw Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">raise her arms once more, saw her blouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">buffeted under an invisible touch. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster had been too eager to return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Her thighs were bunching, her torso</seg><seg type="columnLine">was inclining backwards, bending her</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist into a voluptuous curve; I could al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most see the missing parts of the picture,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the monster's hand in the hollow of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">back supporting her, his vile body leaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her white form--causing that sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den flattening of her waist.

Then it was that Mary straight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened, for the first time stepped backward!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wild hope fluttered in my breast--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">died, as slowly, languorously, Mary sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon a bed of moss!

His gun half-lowered, and hi3</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes came back to me. "What are you doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my house--and how did you get here ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"We got here by being shipwrecked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">78</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the coral reef at the north end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island/' I said. "We found a path which</seg><seg type="columnLine">led to your house. We were unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rouse anyone, so I tried the door, found it</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlocked, and came in. There is a dead man</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying there on the floor--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He said, "Quite," and thrust his pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into its holster. He came toward us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirting the corpse without giving it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance, and stopped in front of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Forgive my inhospitable gesture," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on. "Since no one has landed here</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the past ten years, I was naturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled." He held out a tanned hand. "My</seg><seg type="columnLine">name is Richard Wanderleigh."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I took his hand. "Mine is James Towne.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is my wife."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wanderleigh stared at Marion an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessarily long time, it seemed to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he bowed and murmured some</seg><seg type="columnLine">banal acknowledgement of the intro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duction. Only then did I realize that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl might as well have been naked for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the protection her gown afforded her. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer silk one-piece dress, it was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could stand aboard ship in those lati-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tudes, and she wore nothing at all beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, the sandals on her feet being her only</seg><seg type="columnLine">other articles of clothing. Now, drenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the seas we had fought through, it clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her deliciously rounded, slender body</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a coat of paint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you have any dry clothing for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife--" I suggested--"a pair of ducks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a shirt, perhaps--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wanderleigh smiled. "I can do better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that. My sister would be delighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to loan Mrs. Towne a frock. Come with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, please."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He picked up a lamp from the table, lit</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and led the way into a corridor that</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened off the living room. Wanderleigh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, was dressed in white shorts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt, and carried a pith helmet, all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were dripping wet. What had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">been doing out in this storm--while a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mangled body, to which, as yet, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no reference, lay in his living room ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Apparently his sister was not at home.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He entered her room Without knocking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened a closet door, revealing a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dresses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are welcome to any of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">frocks, Mrs. Towne," he said, and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brilliant black eyes clung to the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tours of her figure in a manner that began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make me see red. "We will await you</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the living room."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">We went back to the front of the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Wanderleigh, for the first time, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at the corpse on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Poor Nara," he murmured. "They got</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at last--just like the rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"A native of the island?" I asked. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wondering what frightful thing had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wanderleigh looked at me with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely calculating expression in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. "This island has no natives," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said after a moment. "It's been ift ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istence only about fifteen years. Volcanic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know. We, too, were shipwrecked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a baker's dozen of a crew. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">chartered a junk to take us from Rapa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Island to the Marquesas where we hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to catch a liner for England. Judging</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the size of the largest trees, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island had been in existence about five</seg><seg type="columnLine">years at that time. The south end is</seg><seg type="columnLine">riddled with lava pits, boiling soda pools,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and is covered with pumice and volcanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">ash. How there happened to be fertile soil</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this end, God only knows. Probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island has emerged above the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ocean intermittently for millions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of years."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I nodded. "It certainly didn't appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my charts," I said. "That seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange, too, since they are supposed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be revised every year."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wanderleigh shrugged. "They're re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vised with respect to the main maritime</seg><seg type="columnLine">routes. It would take the entire British</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet five years to make a complete geodetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">survey of the two million square miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied by the South Pacific archipelagos.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goddess of the Half-World Brood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">...

At Wander-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leigh's direction we carried the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">about half a mile below the house and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">it on a small grass-tufted hummock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Burials are impossible here," he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained.

"As</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of fact," he said with queer hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tancy, "I don't know what they are. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">look something like jackals--and also</seg><seg type="columnLine">like something else. I have a theory that</seg><seg type="columnLine">some zoological expedition was wrecked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this island before we were, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">these beasts, picked up God knows where,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are the only survivors. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was obvious to me that Wander-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">leigh had no faith whatever in his alleged</seg><seg type="columnLine">"theory"--but somehow I didn't feel like</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing the matter. Instead, I changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subject.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I hope I'm not,being unduly inquisi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive," I said, "but I was wondering where</seg><seg type="columnLine">your sister is.

"Apparently they</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught Nara snoozing on the verandah.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I dragged him inside and went gunning</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the beggars. I still have a few bullets</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, but ordinarily I hate to use them</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the beasts.

"Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have been multiplying since they</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed here ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wanderleigh laughed shortly. "Yes,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he muttered, "I guess you would call it</seg><seg type="columnLine">that . . . But you were asking about my</seg><seg type="columnLine">sister.

"And while we are on the subject, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">may as well prepare you for Sicily--my</seg><seg type="columnLine">sister.

"But prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably when you get her back to civiliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion again--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I left the sentence unfinished, as we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the front door--and at my words</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wanderleigh turned suddenly and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me for a moment in silence, while a</seg><seg type="columnLine">80</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">faint smile curved the thin lips beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">his short, black mustache.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh--quite!" he said at last, with un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistakable sarcasm in his tone.

I felt that she carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoided looking at the bloodstains on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carpet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Wanderleigh smiled at her. "You look</seg><seg type="columnLine">charming, Mrs. Towne."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I hope your sister doesn't mind," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Wanderleigh's smile became a bit twist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. rfAs a matter of fact, she has peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas regarding her costumes, nowadays,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he murmured. "I have just been warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">your husband, Mrs. Towne, that my sis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter has developed a few odd idiosyncra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sies during the past few years. This utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">isolation, you know--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh!" murmured Marion, "I'm so</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She was interrupted by an infernal</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamor which suddenly arose apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">just outside the cottage. The next instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front door burst open to admit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender, sun-browned figure of a girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad solely in a sort of brassiere and girdle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what I took at first to be white fur--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but which I subsequently learned was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of the breasts of small white birds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cured and cleverly stitched together. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl carried a long leather whip in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. She whirled about and slammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door shut, falling back against it as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though to brace it against the attack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some pursuer--and an unearthly howl</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Damn you, Dick," she began, "you</seg><seg type="columnLine">fed them that--" and then she noticed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Marion and me for the first time, and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"We have visitors, my deaf," purred</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wanderleigh.

Taller than Marion, she was as ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quisitely, if more voluptuously, formed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The outside comers of her dark eyes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">an upward tilt which gave her a slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oriental appearance. The tips of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">small ears, exposed by her tossed-back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">raven hair, came almost to a point--like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a faun's. Her full breasts, only half-cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered by the downy bandeau, rose and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the violence of her breathing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl's eyes widened as she stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at us for several moments in silence. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, my God!" she murmured in a low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">husky voice. "Two more. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"My dear!" put in Wanderleigh quickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Calm yourself. They're quite safe, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But somehow his remark seemed hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">appropriate to her exclamation.

"See here," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goddess of the Half-World Brood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">protested, "we can't Jlet her go out there</seg><seg type="columnLine">with those beasts--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Heavens, no!" exclaimed Marion ."Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">go out and get her--please--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's quite all right," said Wanderleigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a soothing voice.

And strangely enough, the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to reciprocate her feeling for them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ordinarily they fawn upon her like big</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs, and obey her with an intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is weirdly human--although they al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways become a bit intractable after they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have--dined--as they have tonight."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good heavens!" breathed Marion, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank back in her chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOMETHING in Wanderleigh's atti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">K-' tude told me that he would resist</seg><seg type="columnLine">with physical force any persistence in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my attempt to get out to the girl. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanting to precipitate a crisis unless it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were really necessary, I went to a window</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In the moonlight, in front of the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange scene was being enacted. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl stood in the center of a ring of cring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing beasts--the animals she had called</seg><seg type="columnLine">"shrouds." They had stopped their in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fernal howling, but now and then one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them would turn toward the house, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though about to slink off toward it. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">that her whip would flick out, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal would jump back toward her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whining, with its tail between its legs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She seemed to be talking to them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually they quieted down entirely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatting or lying in a ring around her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if listening intently to her words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">For the first time I had a good view</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the beasts, and I could understand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">both Wanderleigh's reference to them as</seg><seg type="columnLine">jackals, and his reluctance to insist on</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a designation for them. Actually they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were much larger than any jackal, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bodies were thicker in proportion to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their length, especially across the shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders. Their heads, although terminat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in a typically pointed jackal snout,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wider across the cheek bones, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper from cranium to jaw. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole they resembled what might result if</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ape were successfully crossed with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I watched the weird tableau, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">term the girl had applied to them again</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed my mind. Shrouds. Shrouds are</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clothing of dead men. Why did she</seg><seg type="columnLine">call them that ? I have often wished I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never learned. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning Marion was too list-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less and drowsy to get up, but the heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove me from bed early. As no one«else</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be about, I made myself a cup</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tea--which Wanderleigh, I learned, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded in cultivating on the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and went for a stroll, heading for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">south where my host had said the volcanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">formations were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Naturally, the island looked entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">different than it had during the night and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storm. It was a riot of color and light</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but somehow its air of other-worldliness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its mysterious faculty of seeming a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of land from some strange planet, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained. This island harbored some dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret, of which I had no hint, as yet.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't take much of an earthquake to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wipe an island of this size out of existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and we were helplessly marooned on it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of miles from the next island</seg><seg type="columnLine">84</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and thousands of miles from civilization.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A muffled boom sounded faintly behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and I whirled about in time to see a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solumn of black smoke ascend rapidly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">file sky, and then mushroom out into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic black flower over the southern</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I started for the house at a dead run--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hadn't taken a dozen strides when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world seemed to move sideways under my</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and I was thrown to the ground with</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunning force. As I got to my feet, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of low rumblings came, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">from deep in the earth, and another ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosion boomed out behind me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew» from past experience with vol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">canic earthquakes, that this was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a serious one. The shocks were com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at two- or three-second intervals and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly increasing in force. I fell a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen times before I finally reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house* which was still intact, and burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">in at the front door. I shouted Marion's</seg><seg type="columnLine">name at the top of my voice--and received</seg><seg type="columnLine">no answer. I dashed upstairs to the bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room we had occupied--and found it</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty. I was about to leave, when I no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticed a thing which brought me to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathless halt on the doorsill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Marion's clothes were still neatly piled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the back of a chair, as she had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the night before. The bed was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">riot of disordered blankets and sheets--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beside it, on the floor, lay the night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gown which she had borrowed from Sici-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly's supply. It was ripped from neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hem!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The severest shock of all came, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I had to hold onto the jamb to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">from being thrown to the floor. The house</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed as though in a high wind, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">joists cracked like fireworks. I staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the stairs, and suddenly the beams</seg><seg type="columnLine">supporting the ceiling gave way. The walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed inward. The staircase behind me</seg><seg type="columnLine">collapsed and I had just time to get out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the door when the house folded up like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a paper bag and crashed to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It had not been more than five minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the first quake, but already the skies</seg><seg type="columnLine">were becoming overcast, a wind was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up, bending the palm trees and scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering a shower of ashes and pumice from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exploding volcano all over the island.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stood looking at the ruins of the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few stupefied moments, trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">decide what direction to take in my search</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Marion, but I had not the faintest</seg><seg type="columnLine">clue to work on. I shouted her name re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peatedly, but the noise of the wind and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the approaching cataclysm made my yells</seg><seg type="columnLine">all but inaudible even to my own ringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I was frantic with indecision, but at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">I decided on a plan. Having no idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">where to look for Marion, the best thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could do would be to start a systematic</seg><seg type="columnLine">search of the entire island. God only</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew if it would remain above the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ocean long enough for me to cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of the territory which would have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be explored, but it was the only course of</seg><seg type="columnLine">action that seemed to have the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of bringing success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I plunged directly into the jungle, head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing east from the house, intending to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">on until I reached the beach on that side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the island, then make a circuit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north end and work back « south, criss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossing through the brush. It was clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough that Wanderleigh had kidnaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marion, and I cursed my negligence in</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving her unguarded in the house of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">homicidal maniac--but of course, I hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">any idea of what he really was when I left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place that morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS I fought my way through the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shocks continued with gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasing force, and the wind rose stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily. The thicket was in an uproar, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bats, stirred from their daylight slumbers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluttering about blindly in the tree-tops.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Time and again I was thrown to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, or forced to cling to a swaying</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree trunk as terrific shocks shook the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goddess of the Half-World Brood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">island. Already I could hear the acceler-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ating beat of the surf, licking ferociously</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the shoreline as if in eagerness to beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">it into oblivion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then simultaneously I emerged into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small clearing, and the shocks subsided.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This, I knew, would probably be no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a brief intermission, and I could ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect even more violent tremors to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. But it gave me a chance to get my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I was about to strike off through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side of the clearing, when suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the shrouds appeared directly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my path. The beast came to a halt and sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">back on its haunches, regarding me grave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly for a moment. Then it turned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and began to walk off. I started on</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my original direction--and instantly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shroud turned about and came running</seg><seg type="columnLine">after me. I whirled to protect myself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">expecting an attack, but the beast merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned again and started off in the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion it had first taken, halting, after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few steps, to look back at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As plainly as though it had spoken, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that it wanted me to follow it. I played</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hunch, then, and walked over to it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal immediately sprang into the bush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me close behind it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Straight to the south, the shroud led</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, through jungle, across occasional open</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaces and over rocky, black outcroppings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We skirted a small lake which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed within the past few minutes when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a landslide had dammed off a creek, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently reached the foot of a rugged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">black escarpment at the foot of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood Sicily and the rest of her ferocious</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking pets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hello," she greeted me calmly.

Then suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">she turned around, so that her smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">back was toward me, and said in a barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">audible voice, "Come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The pack of shrouds sprang ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, leading the way up a narrow trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">which ran along the escarpment, and I fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed, silently raging at the slowness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pace. Would we get to this boat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wanderleigh's before he had time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">weigh anchor?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The path ascended steeply for awhile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then suddenly broadened out into a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge. In the side of the cliff a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleft showed a faint yellow light. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird cavalcade came to a stop, and Sicily</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed into the cleft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"In there," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I brushed past her, abrupt in my eager-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, and entered the crevice--only to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to a startled halt as an eerily beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful sight met my eyes. Beneath my feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a narrow path fell steeply away to a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagoon enclosed in a vaulted cavern at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">far end of which daylight showed faintly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tossing on the agitated surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagoon was a tiny, queerly shaped boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing a single mast rigged with a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaff-mainsail and jig, both of which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been sheeted home and hung flapping list-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly. Two lanterns stood on boulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the water illuminating the scene--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now from behind the rock which sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported them came a man, his arms loaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with objects which I could not distinguish</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly from that distance. I started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">descend cautiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Wanderleigh deposited his burden on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cambered deck of his curiously con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">structed boat, and again disappeared be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the boulder. By the time he reap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared I had reached the bottom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path and was waiting for him. His arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">supported a large crate which he imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately dropped as he saw me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where's my wife, damn you!" I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead of answering, he snatched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol which hung at his right side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped it up and fired. The bullet struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in the right shoulder and flung me</seg><seg type="columnLine">back against the boulder. He fired again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but missed, near as he was to me. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to pull the trigger once more, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was on him, but the hammer clicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmlessly on an empty chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He slashed at me with the revolver butt</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I closed with him, laying open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scalp over my right eye for several inches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We crashed to earth, with me on top. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had only my weight to hold him, as my</seg><seg type="columnLine">right arm was useless. I swung at his jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my left, but missed as he dodged, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught him in the right temple, instead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wanderleigh screamed like a woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tried to fling himself sideways, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck at me again with the butt of his pis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tol, hitting me in my wounded shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pain made lights dance crazily in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of my eyes, and I knew that if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't get him within the next few seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have me licked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">With an effort which nearly cost me</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness, I managed to force my right</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm into a position where I could clutch</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hair with my hand, then once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">I swung my left fist. This time I connect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed squarely with his jaw, and felt his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body go limp beneath me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I sprang up and staggered to the boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which floated flush against the rocky ledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the shore in deep water. I pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself aboard and descended a compan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ionway leading down into the cabin. There,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound hand and foot, lay Marion on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunk. She cried out joyfully as she rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ognized me, and I began fumbling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ropes about her ankles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goddess of the Half-World Brood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Darling--are you hurt badly?

"I've got to go back and get that</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl and Wanderleigh. We'll keep him tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Up until we make a port--then I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring murder charges against him. Tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you about it later." I ran up the companion</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and came to a shocked halt as I hit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Instead of the unconscious man I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left on the shore, there was now a grue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some, bloody corpse--such a corpse as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marion and I had found the night before</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying in the middle of the Wanderleighs'</seg><seg type="columnLine">living room. While I was below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrouds had come down here and . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was no sign of the beasts, now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had done their bloody work and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared. I seized the cadaver by one</seg><seg type="columnLine">ankle and hauled it behind the boulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it would be out of sight when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought Sicily down. Then I started back</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As I reached the opening to the grotto,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second series of tremors began. I hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated for a moment. Was I justified in</seg><seg type="columnLine">risking Marion's safety by not putting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sea immediately? Then I caught sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sicily down below in the ravine. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted to her, and began running down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She stood in the midst of her beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for me, the animals milling rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly about her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Come on, Sicily," I said. "We're real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly in for it, this time. This island may</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow itself apart any minute--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She shook her head and put her hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind her back as I reached for a wrist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No," she said. "I'm going to stay here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Damn it, you can't stay here. I tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you the island's going under. You'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">blown up or drowned--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She shook her head again. The tremors</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to come more rapidly and increase</seg><seg type="columnLine">in strength. I decided there was no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to waste on words. I grabbed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swung her up in my arms, turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">start back up the trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly the shrouds leaped for me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One grabbed the heel of my boot and near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly threw me. The rest blocked my path,</seg><seg type="columnLine">growling savagely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sicily, call off those brutes!" I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded. "We've got to get out of here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She smiled up at me faintly and shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head again. "They won't let me go,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said. "You might as well put me</seg><seg type="columnLine">down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Another shock hit the island, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell to my knees, still holding Sicily. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">she immediately struggled out of my grasp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got to my feet and lifted her up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good-bye," she murmured and slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arms about my neck. Her lips met</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine and clung. I held her smooth, slen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der body close for a long moment. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she broke away from me and fled down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ravine, followed by her beast pack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She stopped for a moment as she reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entrance. She turned and waved brief-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, then quickly disappeared around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of the escarpment. With a wild, bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion I dared not name raging in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, I turned and made my way labori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously back up the path....</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The little boat stood out to sea in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quartering, puffy wind. The waves were</seg><seg type="columnLine">high and broken, as in a circling storm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and giant peaks of water would suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">pile up without warning and threaten to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp us. I pulled in as close to the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I dared, striving to pull directly away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the land--which was, of course, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief source of danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Within the past five minutes a great cone</seg><seg type="columnLine">had arisen at the extreme southern tip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island, and from its .mouth there</seg><seg type="columnLine">88</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">belched a solid column of fire which lit</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea for miles with a weird, infernal</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow. It was necessary to skirt that end</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the first tack, and it brought us closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">than was comfortable to the flaming cone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I kept a narrow watch on it--and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was how I happened to witness the ghastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">drama which took place on the blackened</seg><seg type="columnLine">hillock to the right of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TCTROM the glimpse I had caught of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">while on the path leading up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the escarpment I knew that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no true hillock, but the side of a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater, in the center of which raged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed a lake of boiling lava. The molten</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock cast an eerie green and yellow light</seg><seg type="columnLine">upwards, which illuminated several fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures standing along its western rim. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Marion to take the wheel and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">my whole attention to that group on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lip of the crater.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The distance was great, but I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was Sicily--and twelve other be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings--who stood there, etched by the weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">light into high relief against the smoke-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtained sky. But a curious change had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken place--so that I could not be sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my eyes were not playing tricks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As I watched I felt an icy hand closing</seg><seg type="columnLine">about my heart, and unconsciously my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm rose in a gesture of protest against</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I sensed was about to happen--what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sensed was inevitable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl's arms raised slowly above</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head, and she stood poised there for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minute, her nude, slender form painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in shimmering greens and yellows by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sulphurous flames below her. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, her body arced forward--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">launched into space!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A small geyser of flaming lava sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">into view--and subsided. I covered my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes with my hand for a moment, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I looked again I saw Sicily's twelve weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions plunge downward. And in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that next instant, twelve small geysers</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped up. . , .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was many moments before I had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength to go back to the wheel; and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did, Marion, whose intense preoccupa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with the handling of the ship had mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cifully saved her from witnessing what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just seen, looked at me with anxiety</seg><seg type="columnLine">written on her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"What is it, Jim?" she said. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you think we have a chance ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Go below, Marion," I muttered. "Make</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything fast. We've got a chance--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">things are going to happen. And damned</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon, too!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As if to verify that, a terrific rumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose, seemingly from the very bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sea, and a huge wall of water rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">off our port bow. Quickly I lashed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel and lowered the mainsail, furling</seg><seg type="columnLine">it on the boom. Then I went forward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took in the jib. Next I freed all the stays</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sheets, unstepped the small mast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wanderleigh had built a couple of sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports fitted with straps, and I hoisted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mast onto these, so that it lay along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck on the port side. I buckled the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">straps over the mast and went back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wheel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wanderleigh had built his little boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">well--for the purpose he had had in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. It was completely turtle-decked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with the hatch battened down, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be as streamlined as a submarine about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">submerge. And that, as he had foreseen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was precisely what it was going to do, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island sank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The wind now appeared to be coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from every direction at once, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't tell whether we were bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on the island, or going away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. But enough was occurring on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island, itself, to drive consideration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything else out of my mind. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment I forgot about the boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly the crater-Iake into which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sicily and her followers had disappeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">boiled over. At the same moment, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new cone next to it emitted a blast of fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam and smoke which seemed to cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goddess of the Half-World Brood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole sky--and a tremendous, livid</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack appeared in its side, out of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured a torrent of flaming lava.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The air quivered with terrific detona-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tions--and abruptly a portion of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">island's surface, at least five acres in ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tent, leaped into the air, propelled by a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">torrential column of billowing steam and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lava.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The end was approaching. I went be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">low and battened down the hatfch. I lay</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down on the bunk beside Marion and used</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the leather thongs attached to it to strap</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">us in. If we were still living at the end</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the next few minutes, we would be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">safe. ...</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">* * *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But it was nearly an hour before I dared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">venture above-decks. In that time the ship</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had tossed madly, gone on her beams' ends,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and turned completely over more than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">once. But she had lived, never breaching</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a seam or shipping a pint of water. And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the mast was still in its brackets when I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came on deck. In fact, I could find no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">part of the little craft that had not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">withstood the fury of the tormented sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">All signs of the island had disappeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except, in the distance/ some floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreckage--perhaps up-rooted trees or oth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er refuse of the cataclysm. The seas were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still high, and faint rumblings came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep beneath the boat at wide-spaced in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tervals. I stepped in the mast and sheeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">home the jib. The wind had steadied, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was still too strong to risk hoisting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mainsail. I sat at the wheel, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back over my shoulder at that floating stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">far astern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I cannot tell you all the thoughts that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to me, then--but this I will tell you;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you may believe or not, just as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I said, before, that after Sicily had</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped to oblivion in that lake of boiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">lava, her companions had cast themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it after her.

So I came to ask you about that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred shares of Standard Cereal I</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought last year."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A startling change came over Dad's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. That doesn't happen often, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it does, it means something's up. "Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">stocks have gone crazy," he said tersely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"along with everybody else's stocks." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was silent for a minute, looking at me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I were a business proposition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which surprised me.

I stopped feeling enthusiastic, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was nothing in me but a queer spon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneous sickness, not unlike the queazi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness I'd had a year before, when I stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto the mat for the intercollegiate wrestl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing finals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Because Harry looked like the ungod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liest job I'd ever tackled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">6&lt;*T'M TAKING young Ronnie into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm," my Dad said in a tight voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He'll have the other desk in your office.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We need new blood in this outfit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaines was considerably leaner than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered him, shoulders sagging with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer emaciation, his narrow face white</seg><seg type="columnLine">and taut as though he'd been digging</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Werewolf of Wall Street</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ditches all day in the August heat instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sitting in an air-cooled office.

We need--new blood."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He barely looked at me, but there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something just not right about the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said it. "New blood." He thinks I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">a kid. I told myself angrily, Chet Wal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lace's kid, and nothing more. I'll show</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him, yet.....But what I really felt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was--half-sick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mind--if I take some water, Chet?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lean man continued. "Parched--in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this heat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I stared at him as he drank cupful after</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupful from the water-cooler, till I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought he'd burst. Dad started saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">something about Atlantic Copper, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry went on drinking, as though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't understand. At last, he finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a gurgle, and shambled toward me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">extending a bony hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I shook it--and dropped it hurriedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The white hand was like ice. Actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold and dry as that, not like any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">human hand you'd touch in a New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">August, unless--you happened to be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the City Morgue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I turned to Dad, when Harry left, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "He's sick, Dad. He's the sickest</seg><seg type="columnLine">guy I ever saw standing on two feet."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sick or crazy," Dad dismissed it sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply, "Or both."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But it didn't seem as simple as that to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I'd been hired to get a more compre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hensive answer. Suddenly I remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the ti red-looking people in the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">office, and I thought, they looked that way</seg><seg type="columnLine">because they've been trying to find out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The scientifically air-cooled offices of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wallace, Brown and Gaines was thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an intangible hopelessness. I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, in a hurry, into the comparative nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mality of ninety degrees in the cab of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">doughnut truck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew Dad was having company for</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinner that evening. Very private com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany--Sandra Howard, in fact. So I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up dinner somewhere in the Vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage, and then continued uptown to Terry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ramsay's place. I had a lot to tell Terry</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">If I put her onto it, would she coax</seg><seg type="columnLine">her sister Marcia to take Harry away for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few weeks' vacation? If she didn't, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the darndest feeling that the Ramsay</seg><seg type="columnLine">pere and mere would be burying a son-in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">law before they acquired a new one. God,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how I wished Harry would leave town!</seg><seg type="columnLine">For his own sake--and for ours. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, with nothing to go by but that per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistent queaziness at the pit of my stom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ach, I felt more than a little uncomfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the thought of Harry. It wasn't some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing ordinary he'd picked up, I thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a cold or the mumps--it was a disease</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And Terry--she was fair as an angel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and just as good. But the remote, trou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled look in her grey eyes when she met</seg><seg type="columnLine">me at the door--that was something new.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ronnie," she told me, her warm voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a little strained, a little harsh, "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing you up tonight. You'll have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">excuse it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Terry, what's the matter?" I asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply. I felt a momentary pang of jeal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ousy--and then I realized from the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression on her face that she wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking this date because she wanted to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It wasn't anything as simple as another</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in her life. She seemed worried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened, and as alone as I've ever seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">a girl look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, she hadn't any right to look so</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone! I was there, wasn't I ? I guess she</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the way I felt, because her lower lip</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembled, and she slipped into my arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging to me as though I were her sal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vation. That didn't make me feel much</seg><seg type="columnLine">better, because I still didn't know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">66'OONNIE darling, have you--have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you seen Harry?" she whispered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I--don't know what it is, but Marcia--</seg><seg type="columnLine">94</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I promised to go to Marcia's tonight. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must go. She needs me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Marcia needs me. Still only a partial</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation. Later, I was going to curse</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself for an inhuman beast, remembering</seg><seg type="columnLine">how I thought, then, that even future in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laws were a bother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, I've seen Harry," I told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">coldly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then," she whispered, "you know al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most as much as I do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The look on her face would have melted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rock, and I wasn't a rock. I didn't even</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind that almost. "You can't go there</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone," I told her. "If you're in trouble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm in trouble too. That's how we are,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt like a dog, seeing that gratitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">and love in Terry's eyes, and knowing I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't deserve it the least little bit. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it weren't my primary business to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be beside her when she needed me ....</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">We were sitting in the roadster I'd been</seg><seg type="columnLine">given for graduation with my arm around</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. It was much cooler driving than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">-bakery truck. That angd-fair face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm against my cheek, as I told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerfully that my truck-driving days were</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, and here I'd just march in tonight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and give Harry a good lecture, bring him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his senses, and thus earn my seat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Exchange.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">". . . and we'll all be happy ever after,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I concluded, though that queaziness in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach was acting up again, "if you just</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust Ronnie the giant-killer." That made</seg><seg type="columnLine">her smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She smiled, and I smiled back, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time, I half-sensed the nightmare that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to come . . . 4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no answer to our ring at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marcia's apartment. Terry looked at me</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously, and pulled a latchkey from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">purse. I don't like breaking in on people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even your future sisters-in-law, so I rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. This time there was an answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Aa-ouw!" The scream rose icily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly, broke on a note that I heard with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">my spine rather than my ears. I shouted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My God!" and pushed Terry away as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the key from her. She wasn't going</seg><seg type="columnLine">in there, not while I could help it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">No lights, I stumbled through the liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-room to a lamp. The room was emp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty, and undisturbed. I shouted, "Marcia!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marica, are you hurt?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A thud sounded beyond the bedroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. I burst in, snapping on the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch as I went. The first thing I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">was--a white rag of a face, snarling at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me from outside the bedroom window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Words shrieked through my brain; Skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't look like that. Human beings don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have twitching purplish eyes, and thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">liver-colored lips curled back on--red</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I stepped toward it--and stumbled over</seg><seg type="columnLine">something softly solid on the floor. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">I looked again, the face was gone. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I looked at the thing that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tripped me, I guess my own face stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">being a thing not good to see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">My hands were wet and cold with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat that had nothing to do with sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer heat, and my mouth was dry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soundless as a desert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">That face through the window--I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have sworn it, though I couldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">sworn to my own sanity--had belonged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Harry Gaines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And inert--a twisted thing on the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">--lay the body of his wife, Marcia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Her thin nightdress lay in shreds over</seg><seg type="columnLine">her body. Under the tatters, pulsing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempo with the aorta, blood oozed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">her white side, forming a widening, dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">stain on the carpet. I picked the girl up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blood smeared my linen suit, covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I soaked every towel in the bathroom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried to wipe the blood away. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the towels had been changed three</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, after I'd called a doctor, that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach began to churn in revolt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As soon as I relaxed for a moment all</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Werewolf of Wall Street</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the horribleness of it crashed home to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Marcia's right cheek was gone. It had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been gnawed away, as though by rats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Long strips had been torn from her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">throat, and there was no tip on her right</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">breast. Here some ma-d Shylock had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">claimed his pound of flesh. Then blood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had filled the wounds again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The woman on the bed stirred. She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was staring at me now, eyes wide, lips</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">parted in an unvoiced wail of intolerable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pain that was turned into a gurgle by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rush of blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Take my hand," I told her, in an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">agony of helplessness. "Squeeze it hard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--that helps, sometimes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Her finger-nails dug into my wet palms,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her eyelids dropped, and a scream started</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through her tattered throat. There were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">words scattered through the piteous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sounds . . . "Harry! No . . . my God!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It can't . . . be . . . Harry . . .!" Har-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ry.

I threw a sheet over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Marcia's poor white body, and stumbled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was a doctor in the corridor,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">walking toward the apartment with an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">elevator man.

In fact, I don't dare go near a cop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But you've got drag.

You'll be better off here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I wasn't going to be better off any-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">where but where Terry was, but there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wasn't much sense in saying so. If I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">didn't get away, soon, the law would see</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to it that I wasn't even free ta look for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her. So I went home ....</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CANDRA HOWARD, looking like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sophisticated schoolgirl in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her two marriages and her grown-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter, was perched there on the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parlor settee. She screamed when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the blood which covered me. Dad</seg><seg type="columnLine">patted her shoulder with the half-conde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scending affection he'd shown her always,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said to me, "You'd better change</seg><seg type="columnLine">your suit, Ronnie.

You look like a butcher."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Terry," I pleaded with him. "You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">called the cops about Terry?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dad nodded, slowly. Sandra started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">weep, softly, and Dad talked to her the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way you'd talk to a child. He had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fondness for her that big men always have</seg><seg type="columnLine">for people they've been kind to. Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sandra had cracked up in that motor ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cident a year ago, and Dad had come for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward as a blood donor to save her life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she'd been a pretty constant visitor at our</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He snapped her out of it quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, and she grew tearfully maternal</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward me. "It's--just so terrible to hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">all this, Ronnie, and to see you--looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">that way." There was something brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her, as though she sensed an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minent peril that would warp all our</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives. "I'm getting you a drink," she told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. firmly. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the most sensible thing anyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have done for me at that point. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulped it down with a gasp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A respectful face, full as the moon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed itself at the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mr. Brown, your partner, to see you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir," announced Jason, our butler, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then Dad shooed me into my own room to</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I did as good a job as I could, but my</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger-nails were still dark with clots of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marcia's life-blood. Maybe Sandra knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">a way to clean them--women often did---</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I paused in the doorway, because it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless to ask Sandra anything any more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She looked--panic-stricken, half-mad with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear. And Bob Brown, standing between</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and my father, wasn't at all the full-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodied man I'd met six months earlier.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a ghost of a man, an emaciated</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck with a white face and feverish</seg><seg type="columnLine">twitching eyelids.

"I said, Get the hell out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Sandra's small nervous hands caught</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dad's wrist, stopping a sure blow at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick man. "I'll go with him," she whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered. "I've got to go, Chet--maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's a reason . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And then, she reached for her purse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even as Dad cried after her, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. Out into the night . . . holding to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reedy arm of a man who was evilly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dad stood there, tense and white. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was impotent with rage. "Dad, I'm fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing them," I shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm coming with you," he said. "My</seg><seg type="columnLine">God, she didn't want to go ... .*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I was out the front door as I shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to him, "You stay where you are,</seg><seg type="columnLine">They may phone you back--about Terry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T THOUGHT I saw Sandra's silver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blonde head through the rear window</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a cab that was waiting for a red light</seg><seg type="columnLine">to change, and that was good enough lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow. I raced my car down Park</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avenue after the cab, lost it in traffic, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it again at Union Square. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">following the wildest of hunches, but then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything that happened was wild, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbelievably horrible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">First, Terry had been frightened, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had gone someplace she didn't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go--because of a sick man, Harry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaines. Now, another sick man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned up, and summoned another woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was obviously panic-stricken at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of accompanying him. Somehow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt Bob Brown and Sandra might lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to Terry. Bob was stricken by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same disease that cursed Harry Gaines.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had to stick to him--he was my only</seg><seg type="columnLine">clue!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">If there'd only been time--if I'd only</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a breathing spell in which to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vince the cops about seeing Harry's wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">face at the window--I might have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">allies in my search. Now, there wasn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">time, and I had to handle it alone.....</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry. God, I prayed, don't let me lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">track of that cab again.....down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Werewolf of Wall Street</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">97</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">town. Why were we going downtown?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown didn't live downtown, I knew, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither did Sandra. Nor was it likely that</seg><seg type="columnLine">either of them knew a soul south of Four-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teenth Street. They weren't that kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. That cabbie was some driver--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he shot through a light at Astor place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was stopped for trying the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't think I heard a word the traffic</seg><seg type="columnLine">cop bawled at me. I was in a fever of</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatience to get going . . . and when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that the bawling-out was likely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take some time, I stepped on the gas, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">while a whistle shrilled imperatively be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind me, I did some fancy stretching with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the New York City speed limit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was gone. It might take me all night</seg><seg type="columnLine">or all year to locate that cab again in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">maze of little alleys that make up old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manhattan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But--this was familiar territory. I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered it the day before in my bakery</seg><seg type="columnLine">truck . . . and then I knew where Brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going with Sandra, the one possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">place they could go in that part of town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was insane, at this hour, for anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be going on there, but something was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on--in the Street. In Wall Street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry. Terry with her grey eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">angel's face .... No, there wasn't a sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an angel's face on the deserted alley</seg><seg type="columnLine">that by day was the richest little lane in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world. For at night the skyscrapers</seg><seg type="columnLine">are dark, their doors locked, and from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">areaways come the drunks, the derelicts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all the spawn of the waterfront near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">No window of all those thousands was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit. Brown--Sandra--Terry--where in</seg><seg type="columnLine">God's name were they ? Or was this dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness hiding them?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw a girl walking slowly ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, a girl I hadn't noticed before. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something oddly familiar about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">gait ... I ran to her, and she turned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The dark face, garish with cheap cos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">metic, assumed a tired smile. She said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hello, Mister," and stood still. So did I.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Damn you, I told myself, this is one case</seg><seg type="columnLine">where you don't say, Haven't I seen you</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. But it was exactly what I wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say, even while I knew that I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly have known a woman like that at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any point of my life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The girl shifted to her right hip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well?" she said. There was an odor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfume coming from her, and it wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">five-and-dime stuff either. I stepped back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">involuntarily. She shrugged her shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders, and walked on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Maybe it was because she was the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">living thing that I could see. I was up</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a stone wall. Anyway, I followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. I had to do something!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I pussy-footed close behind her, keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as much in the shadows as she did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once I had to step aside, into the gutter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because the pavement was too narrow for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to side-step a swaying drunken sailor</seg><seg type="columnLine">who barred my path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She was going toward the building--</seg><seg type="columnLine">our building. The entrance was barred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and padlocked, but she had a key to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate. I ran now, not caring how noisily</seg><seg type="columnLine">my heels thudded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TT MISSED me by inches, breezing</seg><seg type="columnLine">against my face with a harsh whoosh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then it hit the pavement with a dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack. I looked at the thing that had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the window, and important small</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters like nerves and blood-vessels</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped working inside me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In a smear of broken flesh and trickling</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood, it lay on the pavement, face up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That face might have been lovely once--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I didn't know. It was a young girl and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was stark naked. I didn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether she had jumped, fallen, or been</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed to her death. I didn't know who</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was, or why she should have been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that darkened building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The barred gate opened again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy images emerged, with a far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy speed. I recognized the girl who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had accosted me earlier, saw two others</seg><seg type="columnLine">stoop to the thing on the sidewalk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Whatever, whoever they were, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't any business there. I sailed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">them tooth and nail, only to be repulsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by what I touched. I tell you, it wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">human flesh that my fists pounded--too</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold for that. It was the icy cold of death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These creatures weren't alive! They</seg><seg type="columnLine">faded away like mist before me, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was alone in the deserted street. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of the girl was gore. I heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">click of the closing gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I rattled at the padlock, shouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarse vain threats. A dim procession</seg><seg type="columnLine">was vanishing down the corridor, toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elevators, but there was steel between</seg><seg type="columnLine">us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Out of the echoes of my own cries and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those ghostly footsteps thudding on</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare stone, came a dim call. My own</seg><seg type="columnLine">name. "Ronn--" It was cut off, muffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mid-air. But I knew it. Knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice as I knew that I was alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It had been Terry Ramsay, calling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me from the shadows, out of unspeak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able and unknown hell, with cold relent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less steel between us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I was clinging to that gate, shouting at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the things within, when something hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck me between the shoulder-blades.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a cop behind me, the third to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a dislike to me that night, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">one seemed ready to do something about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Some remnant of reason warned me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was the wrong person on whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">to resume wrestling practice, much as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt like it. "What you think you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">doin'?" he asked, collaring me intolerant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. "Better make it good, brother. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I tried to shake him off, but I couldn't.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This time, I had to explain. "A girl," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him. "She jumped out of the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow, and they took her inside ... get me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in there, officer, for God's sake!" It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all I dared say. If I'd told him that I was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trailing the second woman to disappear</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night in the vicinity of a man name-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly sick, I'd have had to identify my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self as the man who found Marcia's</seg><seg type="columnLine">butchered body. That might mean months</seg><seg type="columnLine">of proving to a jury that I wasn't a mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And I didn't have months! I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have--minutes to spare. "I've got to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside!" I shouted at the officer again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He gave me an odd look, wavering be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween credence and disbelief, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the balance all on the side of disbelief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">God, if he were going to do something,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why couldn't he do it in a hurry! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniffed at my breath, while I cursed si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lently, and then rapped his nightstick</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the gate. A sleepy-eyed watchman</seg><seg type="columnLine">shambled up to us from the shadows, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquired, "Wha's going on?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"This guy says he saw a girl jump out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a window in this building," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer. "He says somebody came and</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up the body and took it back in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. Seen anything like that, Pop ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The watchman sniggered, a senile stu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pid snigger that made me want to kill him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sounded so sleepy, I was sure he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">been doped. "He's dreamin', orfisser. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">oughta know what goes on here. Been</seg><seg type="columnLine">here every night for twelve years, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't seen a girl yet. Wouldn't be so bad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thanks, Pop," said the officer. To me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he added, "You've had a snifter, haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you? Say, do you think I ought to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to the precinct or the nut-house ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Make it the nut-house," haw-hawed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the watchman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw red. Dammit, a girl had died</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, five minutes earlier, and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing ... a girl had died, and another</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl might die, if I didn't find a way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting to her. I slipped out of my jacket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">let the, copper have one on the chin as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came after me, and tried to take myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">elsewhere. Instantly, the Street was loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">with whistles, alive with blue-coats, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Werewolf of Wall Street</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">99</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">knew in a kind of hopeless agony that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't going farther without police escort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dad came down to the police station</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as I called him; but by the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got me and my roadster out of hock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having convinced the Department that I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a good son and a good citizen all</seg><seg type="columnLine">my life, it was almost dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dawn--for everyone else in the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For me, it might mean only the day of</seg><seg type="columnLine">judgment.

That was all my</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ father said, sitting heavily beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in the roadster. He looked old some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how, and the white breast-pocket hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kerchief was crushed and crumpled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Over the darkness, grey visibility crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the east; there was a hot wind blow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, Dad?"

I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to get in there--got to find her!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You mean Terry?" he asked. "Terry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right--thank God. At least I can give</seg><seg type="columnLine">you that much good news. Sandra called</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a little after one, last night, and said</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was home. Brown had taken her--</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the aquarium. Said he was go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to introduce her to the fishes. Crazy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like all the rest. She gave him the slip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"She found Terry at her own place</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she got home. Her own daughter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxie, met Terry in a bad nervous state</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside Marcia's corridor.

Maxie made</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry come home with her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I yelled, "I'm going to her.

"She won't let Terry talk till</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl's calmer . . . and the whole Ram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">say family's too upset about Marcia to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind leaving Terry in capable hands. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll just sit tight, son . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Sit tight? After the previous night's</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror, a kind of numbness had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">over my brain. Everything had been too</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible, too beyond belief--was it my</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses that had gone mad, and not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside world? I half-believed that. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to tell Dad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"It doesn't make sense," he sighed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Harry Gaines mutilating his own wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">--I'm taking your word for that, Ronnie</seg><seg type="columnLine">--girls plopping out my office window at</seg><seg type="columnLine">midnight. Maybe the watchman was right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe you dreamt it, Ronnie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Maybe I did," I echoed. If Terry</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated me--didn't want to see me--any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"The healthiest thing for you to do,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dad advised, "is to go back to the office,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wait.

She can be trusted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Sandra could be trusted? I supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. I began to feel that I couldn't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusted. "It was pretty brave of her to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with Brown," Dad said. "Brave--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and damned foolish. She thought she</seg><seg type="columnLine">might find something--for your sake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ronnie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly I felt that the thing wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. One girl had died, and a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">was probably dying rigth now. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick men were still at large. "Dad," I said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you'd better go to Sandra's. I'm--scared</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her. Scared for every female in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">town."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dad shook his head. We had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the Street, and the sun was a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">orange ball over the East River. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving you here," he said. "I've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get to Harriet Brown's."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He borrowed the roadster, and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. There was a faint dark stain in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our building, a stain that had evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">been rubbed almost out. Today, hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unconscious passers-by would tread</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stain, thinking of it, if they thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it at all, as part and parcel of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city's untraceable muck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But to me, it was unholy proof that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't been dreaming the night before--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stain was a young girl's life-blood!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TVTO ONE had arrived at the office</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I came in. Dad had given me</seg><seg type="columnLine">the keys to every office and room, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigated each one. Even the woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wash-room, where I had no business at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. And it was there, unmistakable, faint,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lingering, that I caught the scent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfume. That perfume which had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the girl who accosted me the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, and whom I felt I should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known, but didn't.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   She'd been here, all right! But she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't here now--she was in the limbo</seg><seg type="columnLine">where devils dwell in the daytime. I ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to my phone, and dialed Sandra's</seg><seg type="columnLine">number. I listened to the buzzing signal</seg><seg type="columnLine">for what seemed a lifetime. "Sorry, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not answer," said the operator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And then I was sure that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">trapped! When I saw them again, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be broken corpses . . . but, God,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what could I do?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The memory of Dad's heavy voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to me. "Sit tight." And I sat tight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had to. The phone was ringing, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">I answered it, it kept ringing with scarce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly a pause. I had come to work early, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day of the biggest crash since '29.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a hot job to handle alone, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">August day when the bottom dropped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the market. I sat at my phone, collar</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, shirt soaked, jacket draped over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat-tree, and I sold. God, how I sold--</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I could find a buyer, which wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">often.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">There was the slimmest of reasons for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. It was pandemonium dropped without</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning. Oh, there'd been war scare, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drought in the west--but it hadn't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to make the market insane, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this way!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Somewhere in the back of my brain a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought persisted, and if I'd only had time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to examine it, it might have clicked. First,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been the panic's shadow--Dad</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting that the brokers had gone crazy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the panic within--with men like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaines and Brown going horribly sick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with revolting death gripping the Street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and those connected with the Street. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now---the panic in full force. It was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though that hidden underworld which</seg><seg type="columnLine">skulked through the Street by night had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come into the sun, blasting our lives by</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ronnie. Need help--? I'll--dive right</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I turned to see who had spoken, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad rush of anger made me tremble.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Standing there, pale and sick, but with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Werewolf of Wall Street</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">101</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">good shave and a shine on his shoes, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry Gaines!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I dropped the phone I'd been holding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and screamed, "You've got Terry, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirty murderer! You can't do to her what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you did to Marcia! I'll kill you for it!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The eyelids jerked into a mild sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised "Marcia--poor Marcia!

I'll say someone hurt her!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I saw you outside her window!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The leer didn't go from that white</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, but Harry retreated, as though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were afraid of me. "And I saw you," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured. "It--wouldn't be funny--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell police I was in my own apartment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They--expect that.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could tell them something, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">My arm dropped to my side. I knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I had known all morning, how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">damnably guilty feel. I mumbled, "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry . . ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't know," said the trembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">husk of a man. His eyes avoided mine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he slunk to his desk. The phone was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringing again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was later, and hotter, and financially</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleaker, before I had time to notice what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry Gaines had been doing with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone on his own desk. And when I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice, I went rabid. He was--buying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As fast as I sold, Harry was buying up</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. It wasn't gambling, either. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">suicide! I opened my mouth to call him</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unprintable name--and my jaw just</seg><seg type="columnLine">wabbled there, in mid-air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'DECAUSE, while he'd been sitting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, while the morning had waned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to afternoon, Harry's face had turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">white as chalk . . . and his eyes were pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plish, and his liver-colored lips were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin gash in a rag face. It was the face I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen snarling from Marcia's window!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You've--cancelled my orders all--</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, Ronnie," came from the unspeakably</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vile visage, words croaked as the unrest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing dead might croak them. "Maybe--I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">die for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're damned right, you'll die!" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">howled at him.

His thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips barely breathed forth the words.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'll want to save me--because if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">die, Terry is going to die with me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">His words trickled down my spine like</seg><seg type="columnLine">separate drops of frozen air. I wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill him . . . and I tried to. I tore into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that icy thin body, and when I'd stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking him, he could hardly stand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">His lip was split, and something trick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">led over his chin from the gash. It was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">weak and thin as water! And that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">what Harry had in his veins!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Blood. That's what had been the matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them. With Harry and Bob, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">God knows how many others. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'd better not hurt me," he whim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered from a corner. "You'd better come</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me tonight. They'll kill Terry if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't come with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I clutched at the skinny throat. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a sound," I warned him, trying not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go berserk. "If you tell me where Ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ry is, I'll go there with you--today."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes popped, and he shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat for air. "There isn't any place to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go by day.

I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't know," he answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">There was something else he had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me.

"Terry said if I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen you, I knew almost as much as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">did," I told him. "What did she mean by</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">His lips were drawn back, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned like a corpse. "Maybe--Marcia</seg><seg type="columnLine">told her--that I hadn't been home at</seg><seg type="columnLine">102</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">night--for weeks. Marcia tried to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">me--tried to keep me from getting to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh blood. So I tore at her with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands ... I had to make her leave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I shuddered at that hideous confes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. For there had been a time when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry loved Marcia. I relaxed my hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his wrinkled throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I believed that something would hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pen to Terry if I didn't go With Harry</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight. I'd seen what had happened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others, and I knew that only the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly compulsion could have driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry to buy stocks on a day like this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He was too weak to talk any more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he tried. I brought glass after</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass of water to him, kept everyone else</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the office. My hot hands froze</seg><seg type="columnLine">every time they grazed his face. He grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">paler and his tongue began to hang out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His skin turned gray. . . . "You've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">last till tonight!" I pleaded with him. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took the water, and let it trickle over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gaping mouth and swollen tongue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was agony in his eyes. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth was too swollen even for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It got to be six, and then six-thirty. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought Harry five cupfuls in three min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes. I'd forgotten what I was supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be in the office for . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry's purplish eyes stared up at me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I poured the water over him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't even try to swallow it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And his death might mean--Terry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">death! I had to get to that place which</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't exist by day, and which Harry had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been too far gone to name. I phoned Dad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him I'd be working late.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Somewhere during the night that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed, it seemed to me that sheer out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raged instinct had caused me to draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">back when the gates to hell were open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At one point, I had done the thing which</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped that steel gate between Terry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding place and me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl with the faint perfume. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had asked me to accompany her, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not gone. Well, I thought frantically,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight she may walk again.

She was evil as the first sin in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eden, and I wanted to run from her with</seg><seg type="columnLine">every instinct of my body. But the odor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her perfume persisted, faint and lin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gering, as it had been in the washroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">that morning, and certainties in the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my head grew stronger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I said what I'd half-meant to say the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night before.

I meet so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many people. . . . Walk?" She cocked her</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm, and I realized that I was supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take it. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">We passed the building where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked, the building she'd disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the night before. That wasn't odd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I didn't dare call attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact. Perhaps they changed the scene of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their operations, for safety's sake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In front of the Hines Building, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the offices of Hines and Carter occupy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the first three floors, my guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped.

A door was</seg><seg type="columnLine">open ahead of me, and in the dim light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of that customers' room beyond, gro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tesque shapes swirled and danced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "How do you like it, Ronnie?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clear feminine voice.

There was Young Carter, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was boss in this office by day, his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">pasty and thin and hideous in the dim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, and there was a girl with him . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisting her limbs about him, her hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">caressing him all over his naked body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And there were at least a dozen others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloodless and perverted.

So we brought out DIME MYSTERY</seg><seg type="columnLine">Magazine; and though we are frank to admit that it was at first an experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, we have since proven that we made no mistake. As a matter of fact, most</seg><seg type="columnLine">publishing ventures are risky at best. But we felt the two principal factors that</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspired us were basically sound; and both were founded on human nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Has your mind ever flashed back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair-raising moments of your youth, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were reading "forbidden" literature</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in your room, with your lamp shaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that pop and mom would think you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fast asleep ? Perhaps you were read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Bram Stoker's immortal Dracula, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blood-chilling tale by Ambrose Bierce,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poe, or Wilkie Collins. Whatever it was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chances are that your pulse was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounding like mad, and every little creak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sound--which might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused only by the wind in the shutters--</seg><seg type="columnLine">made your heart leap up into your throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">to choke you. Well do we remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights like that, and every one we know</seg><seg type="columnLine">can hark back to a similar era--it's human</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature. Perhaps, too, you remember that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you couldn't find enough of that vivid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spine-tingling fare. We never could; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's one reason we thought there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite place for a new magazine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Later on we spent a few months travel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing abroad, and once again we ran across</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence of man's desire to be stimulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the bizarre, the macabre, the eerie! In</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris there is a theater known as Le</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Grand Guignol, and each week a new play</seg><seg type="columnLine">is presented. In itself, there isn't any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing unusual about that--but these plays</seg><seg type="columnLine">are like none offered anywhere in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. They are designed especially for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the benefit of those who seek an emotional</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlet in pulse-tingling drama; dramas of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walking dead, vampires, and suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cubuses--creatures who prey upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">innocent in the dark of night. And, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted each night we attended--every seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the house was filled! ... In London</seg><seg type="columnLine">we found a form of entertainment equally</seg><seg type="columnLine">popular, though running along slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">different lines: Madame Tussaud's Wax</seg><seg type="columnLine">Works. This attraction, once a part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the empire exhibitions, became so</seg><seg type="columnLine">celebrated that its owners set it up as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">separate museum. The attraction is com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised of all the most terrifying, blood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curdling murders of history, enacted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures of wax which are perfect images of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the originals. Madame Tussaud's Wax</seg><seg type="columnLine">Works was not designed for those with</seg><seg type="columnLine">low blood pressure and weak hearts; yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">it has a definite place in the annals of en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tertainment; and the fact that there is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">105</seg><seg type="columnLine">106</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dime Mystery Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">place for it, as well as Le Grand Guignol,</seg><seg type="columnLine">added to our conviction that we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">publish a magazine devoted to the cream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mystery-terror ideas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't get the impression that we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">planning a magazine to be gruesome--</seg><seg type="columnLine">shockingly stark.

If we (and all our friends) were</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhilarated by Poe and Bram Stoker, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if thousands of Europeans can be enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained yearly by the institutions named</seg><seg type="columnLine">above, then there must be a market for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the type of fiction we planned to offer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We would be catering to a human need</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much in demand in certain fields as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Western stories or detective yarns are</seg><seg type="columnLine">in other fields. We felt certain of that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">However--that was only the beginning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When we set about buying manuscripts</seg><seg type="columnLine">we found that there was a marked short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age of authors who could supply what</seg><seg type="columnLine">we wanted, for we sought certain com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">binations of eeriness, terror and scalp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising material that actually were not be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing written! We received any number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gory yarns that offered nothing but gore;</seg><seg type="columnLine">we received stories of the supernatural</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were too far-fetched to be convincing;</seg><seg type="columnLine">we received plenty of the general run of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"ghost" story, the haunted house variety,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without any punch, or plot. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to do but hash over every idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">submitted by our best-known writers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">request them to deliver the goods, liter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, on order. (This does not mean we</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't welcome material from new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comers !)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Here are a few of the "rules" we laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to authors: the stories must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern and American. That is to say, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">characters must be everyday people who</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be you, your neighbors . . . your</seg><seg type="columnLine">associates--not people on foreign soil, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages long gone by. There must be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality of genuine mystery; there must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be a menace almost unbearable, threaten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the people in the story in such a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the reader really feels the fear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they feel. And this menace must be logic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally motivated by some character who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reason for it, and in such a way that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could happen--without too great a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch of the imagination--in your own</seg><seg type="columnLine">home town. ...</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Man will never cease speculating upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hereafter. So we find our readers request a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain number of stories dealing with creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">that are--or seem to be--from the mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbo beyond the grave. . . . There are other</seg><seg type="columnLine">types of mystery-terror yarns, too: tales of hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man vampires, sirens, and modern witch-doctors;</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories of the weird influence one person's mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">may exert on another's. Oh, there is ample</seg><seg type="columnLine">room for variety in this field--and now, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is always a constant supply.

Donald Dale's lead novel, Maids</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Dust-Devils, is the story of a nameless</seg><seg type="columnLine">menace that rides under cover of a natural phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomena, striking swiftly and surely. The fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">is caused by a combination of nature's wrath--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some evil influence, enhanced perhaps, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that the characters in this novel know</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their hearts that the crimes are actually being</seg><seg type="columnLine">committed by some horrible, human agency. . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">In Help Me To Die! by Leon Byrne, there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">no explanation attempted.

Little watery blisters form, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skin cracks and peels.

It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> buries itself deep in the tissues of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> skin and is very hard to kill. A test</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> made shows it takes 15 minutes of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> boiling to kill the germ; so you can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> see why the ordinary remedies are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> unsuccessful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   H.
