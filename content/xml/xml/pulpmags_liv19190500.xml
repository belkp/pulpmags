                        happy feet. Remotely fair, for others sweet; And, with a sudden touch of frost, We think of those we used to meet-- The faces
                        we have loved and lost. </ab>

                        so fleet!-- To leave the story incomplete; Dreams, are ye worth the ache you cost? No loveliest face can e'er repeat The faces
                        we have loved and lost. </ab>
                    <lb/>
                    <ab>The friends, the comrades, we have known. So brave and laughing once to greet. They too are dim and ghostly grown. Chap-fallen
                        they, and most discreet; Their jests are long since obsolete. Their goodness on the four winds tossed. And fallen cold their

                    <ab>I THINK it was one spring a burning bush Flamed sudden in the green hills of my youth, And a great voice spake out of it the
                        truth Of Beauty and fell still. A holy hush Succeeded it. There was not any noise Of singing birds or rivers or of flowers
                        Stirring in birth, but all the level hours Were very silent, as when nuns rejoice.</ab>
                    <lb/>
                    <ab>New breath of a new Spring, how many Springs Have been since then? Since wild my dark eyes sighted The amazing Bush with awe
                        and frenzy lighted; And since my cars heard great imaginings Voiced in eternal tones? I do not know: The years are filled with
                        blinding, deafening woe.</ab>
