The earth, as our readers</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, has its axis located by its rota-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, the ends of which axis define or</seg><seg type="columnLine">locate the north and south poles. If a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane is assumed to pass at right angles</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the axis and through its center, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequently through the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, it will cut our sphere into two</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal proportions and will give us a</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle, called the terrestrial equator,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the plane, on its emergence, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumed to cut the surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere. This is all very simple. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose the plane to be extended and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have an area large enough for all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars in the heavens to be projected upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. map fashion, we would have what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">called the celestial equator which is pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured in our minds as intersecting a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">celestial sphere, just as it intersected</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth. The notion of a celestial</seg><seg type="columnLine">equator assumes, or leads to, the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ception of a celestial sphere or globe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">large enough to contain all the heavenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies. This sphere is o£ inconceiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able magnitude, and it is based upon or</seg><seg type="columnLine">founded upon our altogether insignificant</seg><seg type="columnLine">little earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What the size of the celestial sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">is we do not know.

If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied your spare time counting, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would require about three months to</seg><seg type="columnLine">count a million. The sun is over ninety</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions of miles distant so you might</seg><seg type="columnLine">work for 270 months or 22*4 years to</seg><seg type="columnLine">count the miles in this comparatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">short, even minute, celestial distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than one hundred million miles. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of counting a star cluster's dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With all our efforts to get into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stratosphere, only a few miles away--</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our descents into the ocean's depths</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few fathoms only--all such achieve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments are ludicrously small and trifling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We almost lose respect for our little</seg><seg type="columnLine">pigmy of a solar system and for what</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can do in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the planets of our system, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we do not know how many there arc,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we include the asteroids, and all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which move around the sun, each in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">own ellipse, which is called its orbit, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">these orbits define planes, all nearly par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">allel to one another. The appropriately</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Mercury shows the greatest di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vergence, and Venus, who is next in ir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">regularity, has about one half of Mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cury's departure from parallelism with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the orbits of the rest of the planets. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now we come to a trouble in our work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The earth is slightly irregular in</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape, it has mountains and oceans and</seg><seg type="columnLine">owing to these and to the equatorial di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ameter being larger than the polar</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter, and the charging occan tides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its polar axis keeps shifting around</seg><seg type="columnLine">virtually describing closed curves, one at</seg><seg type="columnLine">each end of the polar axis, so that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">celestial equator is in perpetual change,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but to a very small amount. It takes</seg><seg type="columnLine">25,800 years for the poles of the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go all the way through the 360 de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grees of their closed curve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This is the famous precession (not</seg><seg type="columnLine">procession) of the equinoxes. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">equinoxes, meaning equal nights, are the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">two periods in each year when the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">and night are of equal length. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">precession, as their change in occurrence</seg><seg type="columnLine">is termed, is about fifty seconds of arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">per annum, approximately equal to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds in a circle divided by the 25,800</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. If we measured one year by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">constantly shifting equinoxes we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have sooner or later our July in mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">winter. This of course is a sort of par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">adox--we really disregard the preces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of the equinoxes in our ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, but let it take care of itself, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">use our 365-day year and 366-day leap</seg><seg type="columnLine">year as the regulations of our months.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And like most other things, this is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite accurate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So we have to use a basis formulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">definitely on our own little earth, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet less than one hundredth the di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ameter of the sun. and less than one</seg><seg type="columnLine">millionth of its volume. If we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">pour a succession of earths into one</seg><seg type="columnLine">great body, it might be supposed to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">months to attain the volume of the sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In approximate figures, if an "earth"</seg><seg type="columnLine">were added every second, it would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quire over ten days to build up a mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal in volume to the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We have now to picture to ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great sphere holding all the stars of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavens. So we imagine the plane of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the celestial equator passing through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the earth at right angles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">its axis. This gives us the imaginary</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle girdling our planet, the earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">equator, passing through Brazil and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Equador, on our hemisphere, the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">country deriving its name from it. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as the earth is concerned, its equator</seg><seg type="columnLine">is fixed. But owing to the precession</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the equinoxes the celestial equator has</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slight shifting which the terrestrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">equator also has, if referred to the celes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tial sphere. If we left the celestial sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the reckoning, we might forget the</seg><seg type="columnLine">precession of the equinoxes. If the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reader has followed all this, he will see</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that the celestial equator lies in the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aginary plane at right angles to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's diameter and has the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our globe for its own center. The center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the earth is the center of the universe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But our equator is in perpetual change</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the celestial equator also as we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. The saving clause is that the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is very slow, and the starting point</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the motion is reached eventually, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it is a closed curve that is followed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it takes nearly 26,000 years to com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete the precession and start a new one._</seg><seg type="columnLine">The period is called the Platonic year.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is perfectly fair to say that celes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tial distances are but little realized.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are beyond human conception. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth is nearly 93,000,000 miles from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun. Every high school pupil can come</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with that bit of information. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">celestial distances are so great that ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept for our little solar system, miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not figure. To attempt to use miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be like measuring the width of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our continent in thousandths of an inch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The light-second is familiar to most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us in its meaning, even if we do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry its mileage in our minds. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal to the distance light travels in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">second. The distance from the earth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun in light seconds is found by</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividing about ninety-two million miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">by 186,000 giving nearly five hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">light seconds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This distance is trivial. Think of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">light year, 186,000 miles for each sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond of that period. Try the multiplica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and you will obtain, if you make no</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake, nearly six trillion miles--(six</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions of millions) of miles. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing outside of the solar system is as</seg><seg type="columnLine">near as that. A star on the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">threshold of the heavens, the nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">star, is about 4.27 times as far from us</seg><seg type="columnLine">as that. It is 4.27 light-years distant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How long would it take to count those</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The simplest and most obvious method</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of measuring the distance from the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">server of an inaccessible object is by</seg><seg type="columnLine">triangulation. A base line, whose length</seg><seg type="columnLine">has to be accurately known, is measured</seg><seg type="columnLine">off and from its ends the angles with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of the lines pointing at the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject are measured. From these data</seg><seg type="columnLine">a simple calculation tells how far off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the object is. Suppose now that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">method is to be applied to find how many</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles distant a star is. The diameter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth is far too small, so the diam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eter of its orbit is used. Two observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of the star are taken six months</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart. This gives a base line of over</seg><seg type="columnLine">184 millions of miles. Yet the stars are</seg><seg type="columnLine">so remote that there are only a few to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which this method can be applied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A very curious ratio gives the relative</seg><seg type="columnLine">distances of the planets Venus, Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mercury compared with those of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest stars. The stars in question, five</seg><seg type="columnLine">in number, are each about one million</seg><seg type="columnLine">times more distant from us than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets Venus, Mars and Mercury re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectively are distant from the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">at their nearest approaches. Thus the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest star in the heavens is Proximo</seg><seg type="columnLine">Centauri, 4.27 light years or 25 trillion</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles distant, almost one million times</seg><seg type="columnLine">more distant than Venus. If we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach it by wireless it would take</seg><seg type="columnLine">over four and a quarter years for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">message to get to it. Similar coinci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dences apply to a few other stars re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred to Mercury and Mars respectively,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same factor, one million, applying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The distance of a star from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth was first measured in the year</seg><seg type="columnLine">1838, nearly a century ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the slight irregularities of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's shape change the relation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">equinoxes to the constellations in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">celestial vault, they have another very</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical effect which is alluded to in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the story by Jules Verne, which begins</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this month. As a unit of measure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment the French decided to use a frac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">LIGHT WAVELENGTHS AND LIGHT YEARS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the circumference of the earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So they set to work to determine the</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of the line which would encom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass the earth from pole to pole. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">having, as they believed, effected this</seg><seg type="columnLine">measurement and correcting it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">equatorial bulge and polar depressions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fraction of its length was taken as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unit of length. The meter or metre</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the name of this unit in English, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was defined as one forty millionth</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the circumfercnce of the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the poles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> it was here that an error came in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The measurement of a part of the meri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dian, which latter is the polar circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference of the earth, is affected by many</seg><seg type="columnLine">irregularities and the work of the as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronomers and their staff in executing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the measurement was not absolutely ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curate. So the meter, which is now a</seg><seg type="columnLine">legal measurement, and which is invari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, is really the distance between two</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks on a standard platinum alloy bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the temperature of melting ice. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar is kept in Paris with the most minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">details of care for its preservation to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep it intact and unchanging.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The effort to obtain a natural standard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of length failed, as subsequent measure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of the meridian have given other</seg><seg type="columnLine">results, it being assumed that the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">recent measurements are ever more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more accurate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is quite interesting to read ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">counts of the methods employed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. A base had to be directly meas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ured by rods, with due regard for and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with corrections for temperature. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this and other base lines a simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">(in theory) triangulation gave a part of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the meridian, the base line being off to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side. But in the practical measur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of lengths and in getting angular</seg><seg type="columnLine">relations, refinements innumerable had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be employed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The attempt «o obtain a truly scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">meter based on a natural dimension</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed at first. But the measurement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the length of light waves has given the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meter in Paris a definite relation to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural linear quantity. The length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Paris meter is known with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">accuracy, as referred to the wave length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a specified light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the early days of the last century</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wave theory or undulatory theory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light was decidedly inchoate. Huygens</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done some work on it and Thomas</seg><seg type="columnLine">Young developed the theory to quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high degree. But the length of a light</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave of specific position on the spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trum was yet to be determined. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectroscope has enabled any such wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be specified and the wave correspond-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the red line in the spectrum of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal cadmium was selected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The centimeter is a little less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">four tenths of an inch in length</seg><seg type="columnLine">(.3937). The wave-length of the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">line in the spectrum of the metal cad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mium was determined. It is 6,438 one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred millionths of a centimeter (the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angstrom unit). And this minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">length-unit is really the basis of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">measurements, even of the most dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant bodies in the heavens. It is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unit of length which specifies the length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the platinum-iridium alloy meter pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served with rigorous care in Paris.

The floor was without adornment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any kind save for more debris; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls were bare of everything but ghostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows.

"No--no danger!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield regarded him closely. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was easy to see that the fellow was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his last resources.

Probably some renegade, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">chap. It wasn't the first one the English-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had seen succumb to the merciless</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun of the continent.

He glared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first sheet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SIR JOHN MANSFIELD knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrill of discovery.

He couldn't diagnose the peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling. Long association with papyrus</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ancicnt Egyptians had sensitized</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fingers; there was something about</seg><seg type="columnLine">tliis odd grain which seemed to leap</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his nerve centers electrically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This faded papyrus which he hold now</seg><seg type="columnLine">was old--old!

The treacherous light gave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">no assistance, and he heaped an epithet</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it. Hastily he tore the cord from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other bundle, his pulse quickening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both were of the same material!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Interesting--no?" broke in the scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered voice of the white man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield shuffled the sheets.

Still, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a scientist to the core. He must</seg><seg type="columnLine">know from whence this came. Already</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gathered that these men had somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">plundered a tomb. There was a severe</seg><seg type="columnLine">penalty for breaking into the sand-sealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">burial grounds of centuries' existence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was his duty as an Egyptologist, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spected by the Egyptian government, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">abide by its law and enforce it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUT the two men wouldn't talk.

The fever of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploration was once more rising within</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.

He was garbed in khaki</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeches and shirt. A revolver and a belt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cartridges were at his waist--for what</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason he had taken these he couldn't tell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he felt safer with them upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">person. Several electric torches were</seg><seg type="columnLine">stilffed into his pockets, with an unlit one</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The movement in the slithering sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">was precarious and he had to walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">around cautiously. At one of the mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive paws he paused, clutching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather-beaten masonry to steady him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. Keen eyes inspected the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the main body from the outstretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of reposing legs, before he let him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self into the rift.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shaft of his now-lit torch swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness of the shaded rocky breast</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he proceeded slowly toward the up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung mass of stone. From his belt he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew forth one of two long steely knives.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Directly under the stern and set visage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the immobile animal he threw the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The instructions of the manuscript</seg><seg type="columnLine">were clear. He was to get under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Between the third and fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">slabs of rock he must wedge the knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">until some response was got. The torch</seg><seg type="columnLine">illumined the slabs and defined every</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack in them clearly. But he was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided where to begin. Time had</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced itself too manifestly upon them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were cracks and cracks, some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them extending from side to side, wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deep, which had been formed long</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the huge animal of stone had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">put into impassive, inanimate existence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He scrutinized the massive slabs with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sharp eye, until he felt that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">discern the original separations of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock. They, too, seemed to have wilted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and widened with age. Reaching a de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cision, he inserted the knife into one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cracks, used it as a probe to discover</seg><seg type="columnLine">its possible depth, and waited. But noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long while he repeated the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess at each split of the rock, running the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade back and forth. Often, the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knife could not begin to probe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavity which extended to an unfeelable</seg><seg type="columnLine">depth, and the repeated failures irked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. But he couldn't let that indomitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">urge within him succumb.

With nerves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that couldn't be held from prickling into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> irresistible exaltation, he turned away for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a moment. No use getting unduly en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> thusiastic over this, he reasoned.

Sure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> enough the point of the blade fell into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the groove again! Then, with a stifled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> breath, he started to slide the knife along</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the crack!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   For about a foot it went smoothly, his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> eyes fixed upon the moving handle; then,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> with the same abruptness, it came to an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> obstruction with a stop! His face fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Surely, this wasn't one of those false</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> leads! Back and again he moved the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> blade, with the same results.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Finally, with baffled rage at hitting the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> end of the groove as often as he had, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> slammed the blade violently against it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was all so misleading. And then it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> happened!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   As the knife struck the hidden barrier</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> with force, something seemed to give</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> way. His heart almost stopped beating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a slight movement from with-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> in the breast of the Sphinx! And then a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hum grew in intensity, a low whirring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> noise which to him was a tolling, clang-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ing ring of the dawn of success. He had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> found it! He had found it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It held him breathless; he gaped at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hole in front of him, his hair whirling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">madly. As long as the reverberation</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued, he stared stupidly at the rock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But soon it died away with a flutter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his countenance snapped back to normal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The manuscript flashed through his mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was but a part of the procedure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Distinctly he remembered that he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">run toward the paw while the whir was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still loud! He jammed the blade into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">groove again and like heavenly music the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grating sound beat on his ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ran and stumbled through the sand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the stretched paw of the creature, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he reached there the noise died softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. He paid little attention to it, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, seeking the farthest end of the leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feeling around it for an opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which to slide the knife. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he worked with fierce purpose; al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready he knew that he would find it some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where ; it would be only a matter of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he struck the right spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The masonry of the paw confronted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with the same handicap the broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast had.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">disregarded the crumbling holes in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone which were not man-made and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought a thin line which might be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">joining of two rocks. And he found it!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ordinarily it would have meant nothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insertion of the blade into that per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect groove and its sudden stop at some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hindrance, but with a snap of his wrist</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard an empty click and knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it spoke volumes for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he didn't return immediately to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gloomy spot beneath the breast. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw the beam of his light toward it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speculatively measuring the distance from</seg><seg type="columnLine">paw to main body, figuring the speed he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to make to work both ends</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time. The main whirring, he had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered, continued uninterruptedly for</seg><seg type="columnLine">about twenty seconds and during that</seg><seg type="columnLine">period, he figured, he must have enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to dash toward the paw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he returned, started the reverbera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">20</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion anew and ran pell-mell in a straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">line. The unsteady sand under his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">slopped against his soles, retarding him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he threw himself onward, stumbling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forcing his way. In a split second he</seg><seg type="columnLine">located the groove and jabbed the blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it and shoved hard. The purring</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound suddenly rose in volume to a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitch. He watched everything about him</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathlessly, his clcctric light playing</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliantly upon the massive paw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two slabs nearest him began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">slide birck ever so slowly, like a vast door</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a vault, noiselessly 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There, before him, yawned a black pit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, as his torch flashed into it, he sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly perceived that the slabs were start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to move back again. It galvanized</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into action! He leaped into the hole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt his feet strike a pair of stone steps--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then the huge portal closed upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything had occurred so spon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneously that he didn't have time to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gard the consequences once he was inside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the opening closed. It all came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him now as he stood within the Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sphinx, his light playing upon the flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steps, and he whirled upon the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">door with his torch. The rays struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrier to freedom and bounded back at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with a sardonic chuckle, or so it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to him. There was nothing upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">it which might be construed as a key for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this exit. The only thing he saw was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hieroglyphic inscriptions which lined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shoved and pushed but there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no result. Just as surely as if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered his own tomb alive, was he in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">carcerated here. For a moment his at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempts became frenzied, then he laughed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here he had hoped beyond hope to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">an entrance to get in; now, that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, he was trying to get out!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He murmured with a chuckle to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, "Afraid?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE torch fell upon the inscribed</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls and he soon forgot everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him. His scientific sense prevailed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he stood there for the better part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour studying those writings, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the pictures. He sent the beam down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steps and saw that as far as he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">look the walls on all sides were marked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The place was chock full of the history of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Egypt up to the time of Cheops! What</seg><seg type="columnLine">a find! What a find!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His scientific mind swelled with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge. What a sensation this would</seg><seg type="columnLine">create when it would be made known!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What first-hand information was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained here! For a short moment it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed unreal to him--but there it was!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was overwhelming!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under ordinary conditions he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have sat down, note-book and pencil in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, forgot his environment for many</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours, but he couldn't do this now. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps went downward, straight away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him. He didn't know where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at the present time. The hieroglyphs</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't run away. The thing to do was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to proceed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The place was dry, dreadfully dry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusty; breathing was hard. Below his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet was an accumulation of dust an inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick and each step of his shot particles</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air. Soon he was sneezing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasping for breath. And it got no better</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he advanced. Rubbing his smarting</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, he walked smack into a blank wall!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was at the bottom of the steps, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the sloping corridor!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He flashed his light upward and met</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blank musty stare of the stone roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">atop. For a prowling moment he won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered whether this was one of those false</seg><seg type="columnLine">headings Cheops had warned against. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were, he shivered, it wouldn't help him</seg><seg type="columnLine">any! That portal back there leered at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with sardonic staunchness!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it couldn't be, he told himself. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had followed the ancient Pharaoh's in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structions to the letter; this could be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">only way. There must be some way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting out. Two openless walls stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">back at him, fore and aft. Slowly he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traced his steps until he once more stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the barred opening, and minutely went</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the walls and steps, trying with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife which he had left in his belt--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other sticking outside in the groove--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find some crevice which might be the key</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it all. But he was unsuccessful. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs were beginning to pant, straining</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the airless tunnel. Gradually he</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked his way back to the other end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sealed passage. Suddenly he flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself backward with a cry and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shudder!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His light was fixed upon an object he</seg><seg type="columnLine">'iad overlooked, which lay in the corner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the desiccated body of what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">once been a human being! He bent over</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Curiously, as he touched it, it didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall apart as rapidly as he thought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might, though the garment which clothed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it crumbled up into fine dust! Its fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures were indistinguishable. Somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">this fellow had entered this approach and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been unable to proceed any farther!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had perished like a rodent in a closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">box!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE realization of that sent a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prickly sweat over his body. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dire predicament which Mansfield had</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfolded upon himself now lanced him</seg><seg type="columnLine">every time he glanced at the thing at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. There was no exit from here. He,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir John Mansfield, must perish in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole just as this man had! It was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">evitable. Tliat sly old scoundrel of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheops had simply concocted the story of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis, so that he might maintain some</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly power after his death!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a hard thing to bear. Mansfield</seg><seg type="columnLine">gnashed his teeth in rage. No! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't going to take this as final. Cheops</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't be so cruel! There must be some</seg><seg type="columnLine">way out of this. There had to be! This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was--horrible 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The manuscript--what did it say ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every word was etched on his brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"The signs will lead-" What signs?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Englishman's eyes were shot with</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimness.

His struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart leaped at the sight of a fine slit</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it; next to it, somewhat obscured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an arrow which pointed toward it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The knife reached madly for it, the blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">quivering as it stuck in the hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next moment there was another</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those soft rumbles!

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs expanded to a delightful freshness</seg><seg type="columnLine">that brought new life.

The walls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber gave an indelible print of a de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tailed recounting of human lives! It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">far more valuable than any he had yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. Almost thirty centuries before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christ this had been written, and it con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained data of centuries before that</seg><seg type="columnLine">period! Happenings that meant more</seg><seg type="columnLine">to archaeological science than anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">else!-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was impossible to evade it. Silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet carried him around the four huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls and the electric torch was flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down, lighting up the clear-cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">writings. Time meant nothing to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">now; hunger was a thing non-existent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From somewhere there circulated a thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze which assuaged his desire for</seg><seg type="columnLine">water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At every digestion of the knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">confronted, he marveled at the many dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crepancies which beset the twentieth cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tury science. And this was authentically</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusive; nobody on earth would dare</seg><seg type="columnLine">defy what was written hereon! Imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">what this meant, he exulted. And it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours before he could calm himself down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to face the situation at hand, though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt he could stay with this lore always.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chamber though vastly high at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">end, turned out to be about twenty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">each way in rectangular shape. At one</seg><seg type="columnLine">end the ceiling tapered down until it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only about ten feet from the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The current of air came from somewhere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reasoned; it wouldn't be hard to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover the source of entrance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then he noticed that, at the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the ceiling came down, there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">four metallic pegs in the wall, right under</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another. He tried them in an effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to discover their probable intentions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking them, trying to loosen them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bed in the wall. But they wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">come loose. Nothing moved when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammered at them. Surely they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">there for some purport, he said to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, regarding them intently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEAR-BY, right upon the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which he had come, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounced upon another one of those fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">slits and he applied his knife, only to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover that, when the slab-door pivoted</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, it burst open upon the steps he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">so gratefully left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For hours he searched diligently for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the source of the air, for some slit which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would guide him outward. He realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">now that there was bound to be one. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">only demanded his constant exploring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And many times during those hours he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost himself studying those priceless in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scriptions, that redundance of treasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mankind, and nodded his head with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was tiring effort which kept culmi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nating in failure. The Englishman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees felt shaky, strange. He removed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large bandanna and wiped his brow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The shirt was soaked, for all of the cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culating air. Realizing his weariness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mansfield sat down upon the floor, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laxing against the wall with a sigh. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs slid forward and he laid down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch. For a moment, he decided, he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">close his eves for a bit of rest. His arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">were awfully tired . . . tired ....</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How long he slept he didn't know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he opened his eyes and stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinkingly around him it was totally</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark. The fog of Morpheus was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">starting to fade from his brain and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat up with a stall, glancing around</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantically at his invisible surroundings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fo'i* a good ten seconds he couldn't get</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bearings. Where was he? This</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stygian blackness, what was it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hand reached out and brushed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold rocky walls. And then it caine to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from out of the eerie interment</seg><seg type="columnLine">which for a moment had seemed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous possibility. His fingers fell upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor and encountered the torch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a relief he grasped it and snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">it on. But no beam of light radiated</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the battery! He had forgotten to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn it off. Truly he had slumbered</seg><seg type="columnLine">many hours! The battery had burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself out!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment panic seized him, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he laughed. There were still several in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pocket! It had been a fortunate fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight which had prompted him to add</seg><seg type="columnLine">those to his equipment. Quickly he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">one out and clicked it on. The bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful beam was the prettiest thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had ever seen. The feeling of security</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverberated through his entire body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He arose, primed for anything. Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinctly it returned to him how his efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape from this chamber had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">futile. There seemed to be no way out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this underground vault. If he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">find some opening ahead, he'd have to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to that passageway of steps and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a final effort to get out that way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His light flashed its way around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, up at the ceiling. And he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exit as clearly as though it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out to him! He grumbled at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sightlessness; probably due to his en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thusiasm over the heiroglyphs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ceiling, as it fell from its great</seg><seg type="columnLine">height, didn't touch the top of the short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est wall! He moved away into the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room to get a better view. Right</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the place where the four bars of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal were imbedded in the rock and</seg><seg type="columnLine">about two feet over the top one, was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow opening. The light of his torch</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed toward it but the angle barred a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How could he get up there? Then it</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawned upon him that the spikes of metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">were there for that purpose! What a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool he had been! He tested the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">one by putting his whole weight upon it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it budged not a fraction of an inch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here was the solution. It was a form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ladder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His fist wrapped around the next rung,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, repeating this, he dragged himsel f to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the height of the wall, carefully guarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the torch, which he had clipped to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt. At the top he gathered himself so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he rested on the topmost rung se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curely, affording his arm free motion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he lanced the small aperture with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant yellow rays. It appeared large</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for him to wedge himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, and he forced himself into it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dragged his body along. The shelf</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cushioned with a heavy layer of dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">which rose around him, choking him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crawling as he did, he couldn't help</seg><seg type="columnLine">but think. If this were the form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress which Cheops had created, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely that great personage must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellied along here the same as he. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a curious form of travel, Mansfield</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned. Perhaps the royal character</seg><seg type="columnLine">had desired that others prostrate them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves ignobly in some such fashion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What a humorous king of Egypt!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE reached out to support himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the next wriggling process, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing was there. Feeling around, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers lodged on the rim of the narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge. He had come to the end! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">light flared out--into space. Downward</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked, perceiving the outlines of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast room, and right beneath him were</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of the metallic bolts. He leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, grasped the top one, worked a leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose behind him and dropped on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal. In a twinkling he was down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">surveying the interior. And an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamation fell from his lips!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chamber was not like the cold and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare one he had slept in and just left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its walls were streamed in gold and silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapestries, fabric which looked as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might have been draped resplendently</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short time before. The illumination of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his light brushed against it and ferreted</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the brilliant and iridescent gems</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were ingrained in the workings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruby- and amethyst- and emerald-colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones sparkled back at him from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient repose, blinking at him with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new-born fire. It was a gorgeous blend</seg><seg type="columnLine">of color which was cast everywhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the middle of the room sprawled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, low, ebony table piled high with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust. And upon it rested several massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">chests of the same black wood. A half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen strangely fashioned seats squatted</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the low-slung table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He touched the fabricated walls. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the places where the tapestry was cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">he poked a hole right through. But they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were few. It was mostly an artistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinning of thready gold and silver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging together defying the ravages of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. It was truly a masterful piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">human ingenuity. Nothing like this had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever been found before. The tombs</seg><seg type="columnLine">which dotted the Sahara desert, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke after countless years the incompre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hensive words of yore, crushed by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">very weight what artistic messages were</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained within them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chests on the table bore the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">evitable inscriptions.

It was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely translucent, woven and cut in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden splendor that broke into thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of prismatic pin-points. Never had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the pleasure of holding in his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">an object so transcendingly beautiful!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laid it away with utmost care and</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspected the other superb articles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand-wrought sculpture.

Quickly he sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an opening about four feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">square. He got down on his knees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed his torch through it. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sloping descension. In a moment he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced himself through, crawling, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he swung upward the light. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could stand up! The roof was about ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet above him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was nothing to keep him back</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and he ran down the sharp grade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Straight down it led him, a passage that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was kicked into dust as he left it behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Yet the current of air remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him, coming from the unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">source; and that aided his discomfiture</seg><seg type="columnLine">immeasurably. His pulse quickened as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of a goal near-by. Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to tell him that he had left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardest part behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stumbled upon something and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused to pick it up. It was a large gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring, something which might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">adorned a regal garment, etched in silver.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Probably it had fallen from that majestic</seg><seg type="columnLine">personage thousands of years ago, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone through there.

Working</seg><seg type="columnLine">the button with his thumb brought forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">no answer, and he tossed it from him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatching out his last one. He'd have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make haste now, that was plain. If this</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch gave out as did the others, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be caught down in this terrifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness and nothing under the sun would</seg><seg type="columnLine">help then. He would never be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the slits which worked the movable</seg><seg type="columnLine">slabs.

This passage had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to end somewhere. It couldn't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">far. And as he fled along, his light picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out something totally dark about fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet ahead, just like the open mouth of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">abyss and he gasped, throwing himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. His momentum, aided by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grade, had been such that he slid almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the very brink of disaster, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right leg did fall over the chasm, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bleeding fingers managed to hold him</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. His breath was coming in spas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">modic gulps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly he lifted himself and reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the torch which had fallen from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp.

And right near the pit he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thready arrow which pointed toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the groove! He pried the thin spot with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his steel blade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a sudden grinding sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more intense than any of those he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had listened to before, but he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see anything occurring.

It seemed to be a landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage that was rising ever so slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently it reached the top, even with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor of the passage, and stopped!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The void was completely closed up!</seg><seg type="columnLine">26</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His brow furrowed into a puzzle to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meaning of this.

And it did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie stamped with both feet upon it, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it didn't move. He walked around it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspecting the wall beyond it for what</seg><seg type="columnLine">might lie there, but saw nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The knife was still protruding from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep slit and he contemplated it specula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively.

The clear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">invigorating breath of air forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself through his dust-coated, contracted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs; he gasped and gasped. His head</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt of a sudden so light and odd. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a clutching, griping ache in his abdo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and head. He tottered on his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he left the elevator and stepped upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground.

The peculiar thing about him</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the milkiness of his skin, and, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved in his chair and rose to the sump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuously rugged floor, there rippled, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath that feminine-appearing flesh, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">27</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">superb set of billowing muscles.

He had never seen the type. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant effulgence lit up the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND then he turned on his side to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">/i a glance behind him; a sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath fell from him.

Her hair was coiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the nape of her head and it was blonde,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same as that of the man. Her gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment fell from the soft contours of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat and ended a little below her knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man said to him, "How do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir John Mansfield leaped from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lounge in one gesture, with a cry:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Egyptian!

Not for years</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he devoted himself to the study of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this tongue without picking up, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, the conversing in it. The milky-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skinned man, heartened by the response,</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked to him, and though Mansfield</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't get each word distinctively he</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to secure the trend of thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a beautiful tongue!

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbed it greedily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Who are you?

It had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">long since he had partaken of food!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yuxa and the girl moved their chairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eat, my friend. We shall do like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Englishman fell to like a starved</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature. The warmth of the first dish, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soggy but extremely delectable substance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the right spot within him and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried on to the next. He drank deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the tinted goblet which contained an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exotic, bluish liquid that burned like fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it touched his tongue, but which</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted down his throat with the potency</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an elixir. His famished body ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbed the food avariciously. Yuxa sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">by, eat'ng sparingly, appreciating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's persistence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me, Yuxa, why do you call</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheops 'the father'?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The high priest gave him a solemn</seg><seg type="columnLine">look. "It would give an insight into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">history of our race. I shall explain it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you. Long ago, our people were many.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We lived on the face of the earth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were content. History has brought down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us, however, that some cataclysmic</seg><seg type="columnLine">transition was being undergone by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. Great crevices appeared, vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretches of land fell away into profound</seg><seg type="columnLine">valleys, and many of them did disappear</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether beneath the countenance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty waters. During one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">transformations, practically our entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">race was lost beneath the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We were a mighty race, the absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruler of both white and black. When this</seg><seg type="columnLine">convulsion had subsided we were left</seg><seg type="columnLine">with but a pitiable handful of what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">once been civilization and power. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then this remnant of people gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">found itself being forced back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inland of the continent, and where there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had previously stood mighty cities there</seg><seg type="columnLine">now appeared the gloomy wastes of burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sand. Nature was making up its</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, apparently, to conquer us once and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The men, women and children were</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon quartered upon the earth in a spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">about where we are now, and as time</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on it was becoming terrifyingly evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent that the. land was falling, the prodi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gious plentiful land which produced our</seg><seg type="columnLine">every want and filled every need. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly from the west there rose toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">us the terribly destructive sand! It crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer and closer until it finally threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make our entombment but a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Something must be done, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">i</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"■yOU will probably understand our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I scope when I say that at the time we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had developed an intricate system of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnels, which extended underneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land in far reaches. There we harbored</seg><seg type="columnLine">the recalcitrant blacks, the slaves, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnels were operated by them. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was metal in plenty in the earth's bowels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">varieties of rock and earth, which we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned to segregate into elements and</seg><seg type="columnLine">recompose for other uses. The blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">were trained in this work. It was really</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the underground that our pulse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence was contained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We finally faced the alternative of</seg><seg type="columnLine">creating a habitat below or to allow our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves to be picked off by the metamor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">phosis above. So, we rounded up large</seg><seg type="columnLine">colonies of blacks for workers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">created this mighty city here. Our men</seg><seg type="columnLine">of learning realized, though, that we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">at no time be close to the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. There were too many dangers in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But there was left one spot through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we might at some time go forth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was the one through which you</seg><seg type="columnLine">came. After ages of life here we sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">several men through it and then came</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheops. You know, I presume, of that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He met our high priests and scientists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who welcomed him like a long-lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother. He taught us the science of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own race. We were greatly superior to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, however. Nevertheless, he gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally acquired the sovereignity of Atlantis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave unto us his own religions, organized</seg><seg type="columnLine">us into a unified whole. We even speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">the language of the Egyptians; the tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ancient Atlantis is no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cheops pointed out to us the princi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple which existed on the earth--the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vival of the fittest.

The explanation given by Yuxa</seg><seg type="columnLine">held him.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed quite plausible. It fully explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foundation for those legendary ru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mors of a continent buried beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantic Ocean. It seemed highly prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, now that he pondered it, that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">remnant of that race had survived for</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages and had been injected with the fact;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but die years of assimilation with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other rising peoples had induced forget-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulness and had perfected the fact into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory which gradually descended the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladder of time and became a full grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">myth, with no evidence to prove the</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE knowledge of the actual exist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of Atlantis left him cold. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilized people had, then, been throbbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in full force and splendor, when, accord-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the debatable theological belief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had started to crawl around in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavenly garden upon earth! They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been infinitely superior thinkers, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-decayed civilizations had thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were at the apex of their prime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly a voice pervaded the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and Mansfield saw that Yuxa and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venia stiffened, their heads bowed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The voice said: "Yuxa, the council of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men of learning and the priests are</seg><seg type="columnLine">convened below to hear the story of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguished and honored guest, Sir John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mansfield. Pray take him hence!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long after the voice had died into</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothingness did the t*vo hold their heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered. Mansfield kept flashing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed eyes around the room for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation to this marvel. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very walls this utterance had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally the high priest rose and donned</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short cassock which fitted him snugly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He scanned ..he Englishman's face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ra has spoken!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger to the land shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head to clear it. What was all this foolish-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ness! Ra speaking? The very idea made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him burst forth into an inward smile. Ra,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the supreme deity, speaking from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavenly throne! Ha! He shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head that such highly intelligent men</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be hoodwinked as this!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Mansfield kept his face free from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thoughts. He understood now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was being regarded highly by these</seg><seg type="columnLine">men; it wouldn't do to tread upon their</seg><seg type="columnLine">beliefs from the very first. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be frowned upon, suspicion would be di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rcctcd upon him. And he was already</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to like this friendly and honest</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul that was Yuxa. He told himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat abashedly that if he kept glanc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing any more at that incredible goddess</seg><seg type="columnLine">near him, he might be subjected to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base ignominy of an eye-strain and that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">positively, wouldn't do. He needed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes now in the greatest happenings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life, one of the foremost discoveries</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all time. He must refrain from eying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the graceful figure who was possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an artistic superbness that was bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liantly unearthly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come," ordered the high priest. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">go!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY proceeded toward the wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mansfield gazed questioningly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he saw Yuxa stalk straight at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorless obstruction. Just as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached it a panel slid back and a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening appeared. The Englishman</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted in astonishment at the apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle and Yuxa, looking back, quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood. He laughed and beckoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">him closer, pointing to a small colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">niche in the wall. He bent over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strctched a thin elastic covering which lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a small bulb. It was yellowish and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed brilliantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Every room is like that, Sir John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mansfield.

Ordinarily, it is of dull yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">color. But our bodies are so close that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is operating up to its capacity."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was stupendous, thought the scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tist. The photoelectric cell acted in sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilar fashion, dependent upon emanating</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves. Their very knowledge of it raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">his esteem of them immeasurably. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were truly a modern people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The upper portion of the temple, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trio were now vacating, shaped up as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gorgeous outfitting of religious designs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and garbs. Mansfield found himself go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through resplendent interiors one</seg><seg type="columnLine">after another. Individually, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shrines of the gods which were wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipped devoutly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The most superbly fitted was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber of Ra. At one end was a golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">throne of fine carving, next to an altar;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high priest informed Sir John that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was for the eternal repose of the great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est of all divine beings, always occupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Ra.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never," stated the tall blonde man</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverendy, "has anyone ever seated him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in the throne. Ra, may he ever look</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us with a benign eye, sits there for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever and ever."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In rapid succession followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber of Osiris, with an immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">effigy of an ox suspended aver the altar;</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Isis, who had originally been the god-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dess of the earth but later was enthroned</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a lunar heaven; the room of the god</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canopus, with the four corners sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merged in water; of Aelurus, the Egypt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ian deity, who had originally been a gor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geous Diana, but to be unmolested by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giants had transformed herself into a cat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All of these figures Mansfield recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized with a glowing heart. His archaeo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">logical findings had brought him face to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">face with many of them ; scientific lore</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given him a clear depiction of all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well did he realize what this meant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the standpoint of knowledge!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Never had he or any other living person</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in chambers of worship real as</seg><seg type="columnLine">this! It was with reluctance that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">left them behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was one, however, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">held him a while, suffusing him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength and power, as he gazed upon its</seg><seg type="columnLine">massive import. It was the covenant of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chou; in the Egyptian category he cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">responded to the Reman Hercules. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense figure of stone stood in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the room. On it was inscribed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a prayer form. Sir John Mansfield gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it covetously, but a nudge at his elbow</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him continue on his way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked steadily downward to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">council room, his brow furrowed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. The honor of being permitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">residence in the temple of the gods was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something out of the ordinary. Only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high priests were afforded entry into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrines. That he had been taken above</seg><seg type="columnLine">here showed the respect they had for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Atlantis! It kept ringing through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain without ccase! He had discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lost race--and found a people wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipping deities absolutely foreign to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Atlantis men and women who</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayed to Egyptian gods! What power</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fellow Cheops had! To rule over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a people far above his own in intellect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How had he done it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought they were never going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop going downward, when he came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his muse. He raised his head to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in an immense room flooded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">light and replete with humanity At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of him, voices broke into a din that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was deafening. He blinked to relieve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain of the brilliance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Around the hall were seated many men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the middle of the room was a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">32</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">table around which squatted more. Yuxa</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved to the head of the gathering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beckoned Mansfield to him. Gradually a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stillness dropped upon the audience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time Mansfield had an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellent view and study of the men of At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantis. It was a peculiar thing, he noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">how they all seemed alike in their hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">someness and physique; tall bodies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful construction; physiognomies</seg><seg type="columnLine">sculptured of magnificent animate ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terial. The assemblage of men was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to make him intake his breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard Yuxa talking, paying tribute</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. And then, after a while, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself on his feet speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, trying to find himself in words.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes were roaming on the eager rapt</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces. They wanted to know everything!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he started in to give it to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But like a thunderclap every head</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped. Mansfield, standing alone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a profoundly raucous voice break</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Arise! Men of Atlantis! The blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">have risen!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again that same voice 1 What potency</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it that made everybody's head bow to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his breast so awedly? Yuxa had told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Ra spoke thus from his eternal rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing place. The Englishman wondered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT the next instant, as the tone had</seg><seg type="columnLine">died away, every man was on his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The blacks had risen! The white men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pouring out in a mass, and Mans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field found that Yuxa was leading him</seg><seg type="columnLine">out by the elbow, through the door by</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had entered. With Venia on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heels, the high priest ran upward into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the temple. He pattered quickly after</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The blacks again!" snapped the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest. "They must be subdued!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flitting after Yuxa was in itself an</seg><seg type="columnLine">arduous task. He whirled on like a mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Presently Mansfield found himself</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in a small chamber. Yuxa ran quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the wall and pressed something. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly a large section slid back and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore them stretched an open vista of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">illuminated country. It was the city of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield ran to it and peered out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Far beyond he saw a crazy twinkling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights. From all the houses men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodging in and out. They were carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">small cylinders in their hands, speeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward that mad flickering of yellowish</seg><seg type="columnLine">green lights. Yuxa brushed by him, hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, too, one of the weapons with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of the men below were armed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Closer and closer came the flashes, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til Mansfield soon visioned a large mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of black men steadily forging onward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a grumble, Yuxa tossed the cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him and ran out. In a few mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments he was back again, roiling a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine quickly before him. He kicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinder out of the way and centered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the large thing out over the city, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned its nozzle down upon the mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fighting was fierce now. He heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venia ask her parent: "How did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks get so many cylinders?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The high priest shrugged his shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His blue eyes were gazing steadfastly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the struggle. The mass of mpn was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing closer with each ensuing moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mansfield saw beneath him huge blacks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nubian in physique. He had seen two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them earlier, when they had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the chamber the food, but they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed docile faces. Those below were</seg><seg type="columnLine">brutal-appearing in every respect.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked a massacre and his eyes popped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The advantage was all with the invaders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That ray business was no good at all!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was this foolishness?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YUXA clicked a lever, and from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth of the machine there spewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth the same yellow-green spray, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had wide latitude.

All</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the line they were dropping heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground.

But that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly too ludicrous to believe, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wanted earnestly to believe this hon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est-faced man, the high priest of Atlantis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He scoffed at the idea that it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavenly voice. It was ridiculous!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That Yuxa had nothing to do with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">deception was clear. Mansfield saw.

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something ominous about this! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the more Mansfield thought of it, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">less he could understand it. Being a</seg><seg type="columnLine">twentieth century scientist he longed</seg><seg type="columnLine">avidly to hound this mystery to its source.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But being, also, an honored personage in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this holy temple of the gods he realized,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, that it did not give him reason to</seg><seg type="columnLine">misapply their trust in him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yuxa strode to the panel. "Come, Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">John."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Dungeon0</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGH a labyrinth of corridors</seg><seg type="columnLine">they went, to pause before a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectangular glass. The high priest</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed a projection on the wall and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass suddenly became animate. A sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionary picture flashed into view, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a glance at it Yuxa pressed again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a sectional panel glided back noise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield perceived a large platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">which led out over a ten or twelve foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop. They went on it and the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid back behind them. Yuxa led him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the stage and he saw a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder that seemed to be some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicle. Up ahead, situated every fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet or so, were large circular rings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal braced on stout pillars which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooted firmly in the ground. Far down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lighted tunnel those circular rings</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared at regular intervals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY entered the car and the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest approached a large bulb, sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilar to the one which activated the hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">panel, and turned a switch. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved his hand over the reddening ball.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a flash the car whizzed away. It sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedily through the suspended circles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Yuxa explained as magnets oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated by the bulb. It was more ingenuity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Atlantis' mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The speed of the magnetic car was tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous as it whirled through the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">rings. At one time, the vehicle suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to an easy stop, and Mansfield saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the glass partitions that they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached an intersection and that another</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicle was whirring by. And in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next instant they were continuing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">joumey downward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Along the brilliantly lighted walls there</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared occasionally large stretches of</seg><seg type="columnLine">transparent glass which showed subter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranean chambers, and several times many</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were to be seen at work there. Soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were passing chamber upon chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slowing down. The car gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to a stop and Yuxa moved toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entrance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A large portion of the wall of glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">now showed a jumble of men. Mansfield</seg><seg type="columnLine">went through the panel and found him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in a huge underground, cave-like in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior which had dozens of illuminated</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrances, through which men were en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering and leaving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what absorbed his interest was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of surly blacks who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched, shackled against the walls. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the dungeon which harbored the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured men. And lying upon the floor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were many whites who had just been re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased from the paralyzing ray by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter- and antidotal emanation. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were lounging around, gathering once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more their strength, watching haphazard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly the proceedings which were about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the entrance of the high priest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir John Mansfield, the hubbub subsided.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yuxa paced the vast hall, Mansfield fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing upon his footsteps. The high</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest gazed occasionally at some feature</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a black who was fastened securely in</seg><seg type="columnLine">chains, then strode on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yuxa addressed a man similarly garbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as was he, a youngish appearing fellow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kodro, are they all here ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded.

Many straightened up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hurriedly for other parts. Yuxa</seg><seg type="columnLine">started at the nearest black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the silence which ensued among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whites, there rose from the captured/</seg><seg type="columnLine">throats a vicious and malevolent abuse, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which no attention was paid. The whit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish pupils of their dark eyes were shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">with imprecations, their thick voluptuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">jowls slobbered with anathema. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham-like hands clenched and unclenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a spasmodic desire to tear and rend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yuxa moved hesitatingly by each one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eying every attractive feature which</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be made use of.

It seemed that the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest was trying to segregate those with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some human nature in their physical con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT a gesture of the high priest a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">would focus his cylinder upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow, until he slumped unconscious in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fetters; then two others would lift</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to their shoulders and carry him out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">36</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Those who were passed by raised a bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lam of menacing snarls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took several hours for Yuxa to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire round of the chamber. More</seg><seg type="columnLine">than fifty likable prospects had been sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urated with the devitalizing ray and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been taken forth. The high priest nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost imperceptibly to Kodro, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Mansfield.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now you shall see how we do away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with these creatures. It is the most hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mane passing for them.

Gone was their struggling; spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">was their smoldering hatred; present was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a terrifying palsy that wracked their</seg><seg type="columnLine">brawny bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A white reached up and unlocked a side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the big box on wheels, and with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">release of the heavy door slid out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluish light, clinging, however, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening as it swung. There, staring out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the center was something grayish</seg><seg type="columnLine">which bubbled seethingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The deathly silence was split as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks renewed their fury, putting forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">their utmost strength in an endeavor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">release themselves from the links. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of that grayish matter had imbued</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with a ferocious, maddening</seg><seg type="columnLine">frenzy; they shrilled ear-splittingly, roll-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their blood-shot orbs insanely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yuxa moved down and pointed at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one. "He!" said the High Priest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The huge negro was suddenly set</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon by a half dozen whites and loosened</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his fetters. He fought with utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandon to free himself of the many</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands which held him safely, cried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">begged, wheedled. He twisted and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torted his body. The whites lunged to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the thing on wheels, lugging their</seg><seg type="columnLine">load of human flesh, and bracing them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves before the aperture they heaved</seg><seg type="columnLine">him directly into the grayish matter. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">unearthly cry burst from him as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slopped into it.	-~</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield, unnerved by the procedure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at the sight of the black body plop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping into the stuff.

The gray matter started to spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, covering him up, and slowly there</seg><seg type="columnLine">began before Mansfield's eyes the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete dissolution of the black body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The matter ate him up as it burbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him and in a short while there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing left in view other than a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">shank.

You can easily wonder, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you've seen it work, why it was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole land wasn't eaten up. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter started in to devour everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a while. If it hadn't been for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunate discovery of this repellent ray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">life would have succumbed here. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only thing which keeps it in check."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The process of eliminating the blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">was continued, but Mansfield turned from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight with a shudder and strolled ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sently toward a lighted portal. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting him upset; it rasped on his sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fairness. But diese men knew what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were doing. It wasn't often that</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a potent weapon was at hand with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which to fight the foe. The whites were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to be condemned for the practise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The strange feature of that thing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">its unquenchable hunger. It took body</seg><seg type="columnLine">after body into its grisly, inhuman mouth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough in quantity to displace its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass. Yet it didn't seem to get any</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger or smaller. Its convulsive motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept calling for more and more! Gray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous matter! Good lord! Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">shudder shook him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was glad he had left the vast dun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geon behind, now that he was strolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the lighted tunnel. He couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand the sight of the thing. Men were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">moving about constantly. They went-by</seg><seg type="columnLine">him bowing respectfully. His move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments were free from surveillance. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of them, a high member.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scientist warmed at their reception</seg><seg type="columnLine">and acceptance. And he began to look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">them clearly. It wasn't a recalcitrant</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture or revenge that prompted them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do away with the captured Nubian crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures. It was only that they- wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">freedom for the proper outlet of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own cultured expressions. The blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a constant thorn in their sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Yuxa was a splendid fellow. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't at any time forced upon him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">command of any sort. The high priest</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized the difference that might exist</seg><seg type="columnLine">between his people and those up above;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was lucid-minded enough to let him</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow his own inclination. People down</seg><seg type="columnLine">here didn't eye everybody else with sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picion. They lived like one vast family</seg><seg type="columnLine">in contentment and harmony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A ND then there was Venia--He won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jcV dered where she had gone f rom that</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper room in the temple, during the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">broglio. Well, he'd soon get a chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get amongst the dwellings of the whites</seg><seg type="columnLine">and become friendly with the people. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could study their habits, their likes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dislikes, see what sort of family life was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being lived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was thus draped in thought when</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eye halted at an entrance into a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber. There were many bodies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men there, slashed and clubbed, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciously recumbent upon slabs of rock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Around them were several handsome men</seg><seg type="columnLine">chatting. At the sight of him they rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield nodded to them and entered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He surveyed the injured men. Several,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he noticed, were in critical condition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing was being done to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why are they permitted to lie like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this? They wiU die."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Sir John," one man said. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">38</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">will not die. Those large bulbs overhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">are spraying their mangled bodies with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a light that keeps the wounds from mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing any progress, from deteriorating. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">await only Yuxa. They will be on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in a short while."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield gazed at one body with as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonishment. A man's whole chest was</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid open. He could even see the aorta</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading to the heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He will die!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The white shook his head with a smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No. It is not fatal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat down and rested himself on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone bench, shaking his head in puzzle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. This would be interesting to watch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If they ever patched up that fellow, or all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these men. they were master minds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the high priest strode in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes lit up with pleasure as he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mansfield.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thought I had lost you, Sir John."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Immediately the men about him began</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightening up the man on the slab,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest to the door. His head had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">slashed from brow clear to the back;</seg><seg type="columnLine">skull was clearly fractured. Yuxa and</seg><seg type="columnLine">another tall man with him scanned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">injury carefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Against the wall was a case in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were many strange types of instruments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of surgery. From the ceiling fell a whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">array of bulbs of many designs. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall man reached up and brought down a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube which he snapped on. It buzzed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with consistency, as a dazzling white</seg><seg type="columnLine">light sped from a small hole in the center.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thin beam was allowed to play upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cloven skull, while Yuxa busied him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self with the instruments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He selected a sharp one, obviously a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scalpel, and. unmindful of the noisy ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was playing upon the fracture, cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose all shredded flesh and bone. At one</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, Mansfield saw that there was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least a half-inch of brain matter open to</seg><seg type="columnLine">view. The high priest, with sure and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perienced hands, removed all foreign</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">matter from the wound. The steady gush</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ray held by the tall man flowed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the injured place. What it did, the En-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glishman couldn't perceive, but he did re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark that not one drop of blood had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed in the operation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Yuxa had finished his work of</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicacy, he straightened up. Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulb was brought down. It was oblong</seg><seg type="columnLine">in shape, with a long handle from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">base. The lengthy stem was fitted into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a groove at the head of the slab and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned on. From its ugly mouth there</seg><seg type="columnLine">issued a deep red which suffused the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire head of the unconscious man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield bent closely to watch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect upon the open cranium. Slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever so slowly, just as though a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth was being manufactured, the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">edges of bone were coming together. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounded exclamation sprang from him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was incredible, unbelievable! His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were upon the wound, searching for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell-tale evidence that a cavity had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, long after the hole had been cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered up. But there was nothing, abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely nothing. The skin and bone had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come together and the head was as normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood up, eyes glistening. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">miraculous craft lay here! What super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings these men were! Think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it! This would have been a fatal case</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the earth; surgery such as this had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never been seen. And it was the rays--</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays--rays! The men of Atlantis were</seg><seg type="columnLine">literally composed of rays!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YUXA was at another table working.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tall man came back and surveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head. He nodded to himsel f, snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the rays, took out yet another bulb</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flashed it into life. It was the anti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dote to the paralyzing emanation, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">large frame of the reclining man went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a shudder, his muscles flexing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reflexing. Presently his eves opened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stared around him, sat up with a jerk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In a jiffy he was off the slab and walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">around, smiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just like that! It was almost uncanny!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nobody paid any attention to him; on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth the fact would have been spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">to every corner of the world. The high</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest didn't even lift his head from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mangled leg he was working upon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then Mansfield saw that body</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose chest had been laid open. While</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been gasping over the repaired</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, Yuxa had finished the man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone on. He stared at the chest in won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. The reddish ray was spraying it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There wasn't anything there which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have pointed to a former wound!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir John Mansfield went from table to</seg><seg type="columnLine">table as in a dream. Soon the slabs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming empty and live, healthy hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mans were filling up the room. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last man had bounded from the slab and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched his arms, he turned to the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest. But Yuxa said, preoccupiedly:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now for the blacks!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Brain Process</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE chamber wherein the blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">were secluded was a more tempes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuous place. Dozens upon dozens</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men were entering and leaving. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the walls were limp forms of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks who had been picked from the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured group. They were still under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence of the paralyzing ray, save for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half dozen or so in one corner who, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some reason, liad not been subjected to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unconscious state. These set up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise which almost deafened Mansfield.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a large table directly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the room. Toward it hastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high priest. Arranged upon a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">slab was a neat row of more instruments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Already there reposed upon the table a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently breathing figure of a black. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how, in his sleep the fellow didn't appear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">so vicious and wicked. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">somnolence in his features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A liquid from a flask was poured upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hairy head, and as the whitish, buzz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing bulb sprayed upon the skull, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair came off like a peeled skin, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flesh bare for operation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll explain the method," Yuxa said</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mansfield. "We discovered through</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute study of the brain that every lobe</seg><seg type="columnLine">is there for some purpose. In one there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is contained the factor which controls the</seg><seg type="columnLine">working of nerve coordination, in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">is sorrow and so forth. There is a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain group which caters to emotion. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the operation which I atn about to per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form you will notice that I remove but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small portion of one of the lobes. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the group of emotions; one which</seg><seg type="columnLine">reacts to hatred, revenge, lust and so 011.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is that essence of discontent which</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be withdrawn before the black can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be of use to us. Now watch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It happened so fast that the scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely got a view of what the high priest</seg><seg type="columnLine">did. The scalpel made one quick incision</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the bone which was like soft putty</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the ray. The deft fingers laid back</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ends of the flesh and bone; not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop of blood was evident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With another slender instrument of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the type of scissors, he delved into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow aperture and with a quick move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment flicked out a piece of whitish matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was no larger than the shred of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger nail. Again he did tin's. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with expedition the reddish light focused</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself upon the wound. A new flesh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone coated over the severed lobe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is simple," continued Yuxa. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sections which compose the brain are,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all, but fountains from which arise</seg><seg type="columnLine">every emotion or basic action of the hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man body. Why shouldn't we strike at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the source always, instead of prowling</seg><seg type="columnLine">ineffectually in case of need? This fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, :rom now on, will retain every sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had hitherto been subject to,</seg><seg type="columnLine">40</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but when it comes to the display of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">negative features which I mentioned, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not take part."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The bloodlessness!" cried Mansfield.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How do you accomplish that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT is controlled by the absorp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion rays, which that beam of buzz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing light produces. It sutures every inci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion instantly, softens all bone and flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately for the path of the knife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The blood vessels are not tampered with.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It also controls the temperature of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, keeping it in normal state always.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The red ray here creates a rapid growth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of superficial flesh which will suffice ade-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quately, until the natural process brings</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a full recovery. At no time is there</seg><seg type="columnLine">any danger or discomfiture to the pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tient."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The black's respiratory organs were ris-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing and falling steadily. He was released</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from his catalyptic stage and his eyes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fluttered open. Yuxa shut off the rays.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Just watch his actions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black bolted upright, grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheepishly at the men around him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped off the table and gazed inquir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly at the men chained to the walls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently he strolled over to the few</seg><seg type="columnLine">black men who were conscious and talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them. Their reception of him was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiery and blasphemous curse upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. He had desecrated his blackdom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he was indifferent to that. Casually</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke to them of their incarceration:</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything seemed to be perfectly normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was at that moment that a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">negro, tugging violently at his chains, suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded in breaking loose. For a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">the actual freedom dazed him. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a tremendous cry issuing from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs, he leaped through the air, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhing, post-like arms tensed for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unwary figure of the high priest. Down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him he came!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE place was in an uproar. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whites stared at this instantaneous</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurrence, rooted immovably even when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snaky fingers of the prisoner sunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Yuxa's neck in an attempt to tear his</seg><seg type="columnLine">jugular from his throat. The high priest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken at such a terrific disadvantage, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pawing the air, his legs sliding from un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der him. His head was being forced back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his eyes were distended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With an unconscious gesture, Mans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field's hand shot downward to his hip;</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the same motion his revolver flicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and he fired! Since he had entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis, the presence of that weapon had</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost been forgotten. It was only when</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand brushed by it, that he was cog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nizant of its contact with his hip. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">now--now he was thankful that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the foresight to equip himself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The massive black, his insane eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">glued murderously upon his victim, sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly relaxed as blood gushed from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.

They whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with mouths agape to stare at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger to Atlantis, holding his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a stick which spat death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE high priest came slowly toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mansfield, eyeing him intently, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at the weapon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What power you hold in your hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my man! You have saved me from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beastly finish ... I have often won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered what that w'as which clung to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">mid-body. May the gods preserve you!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">A deep sigh fell from his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And with that he came to the stranger</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and encircled his shoulders with a quiver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">41</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing arm; an absolute act of brotherhood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The high priest looked at his fellow-men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and bowed; they nodded in silent respect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield felt somewhat foolish stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing there with the gun, and having the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men bow before him. He knew that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't paying tribute to his magic. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only their Utopian spirit which spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the saving of their leader. Their eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were suffused with affection; comradely</seg><seg type="columnLine">worship. He slipped the gun back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the holster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, when the work was finished in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dungeons and he was taken back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chamber where the men of learning</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the priests were convened again, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to show them what power really was</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained in his "noise stick." He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explain to them the intricacies of gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder, the mystery of how the steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacketed bullet was expelled through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">medium of the gases formed by the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">composition of the same powder. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a stand away from a wall and shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">once at it. Then he held aloft the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trieved misshapen bullet, passed it around</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all to see.

And too, I want to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charley Ling at Yokohama. Charley</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ling is an operative who has worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">under me in The U. S.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">has some data which we dare not send</seg><seg type="columnLine">by mail, and he cannot come to me just</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. I am most anxious to obtain these</seg><seg type="columnLine">data which I hope to use in writing more</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my series of articles in an effort to</seg><seg type="columnLine">induce the American people to demand</seg><seg type="columnLine">an adequate aerial defense against an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nihilation at the hands of some more ag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gressive power. The Ultra-Gamma Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jector, you see. is effective only for pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poses of invasion. You could not bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a plane with it. Though, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so long as other powers know that such</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instrument is in our possession there</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be no attempt at invasion.

There were natives, en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trapped by fallen timbers and by fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who called out to us piteously for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">help we dared not spare the time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">render.

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were several growths of shrubbery scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered about and Farley whispered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">52</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">warning to proceed with care, as he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved the rays issued from that hut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We concealed ourselves behind this</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrubbery as much as possible, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were times when we had to expose our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves to view from the hut in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach nearer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It liad been quiet for some moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Farley's gauge failed to register any</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbance, so we reckoned that the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jector had been turned off, at least tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porarily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were within about thirty yards of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hut when suddenly Farley staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crumpled forward upon his face as</seg><seg type="columnLine">simultaneously there came the crack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a high-powered rifle from one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I dived at once for a dense growth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">high bushes near by, and a second shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed me as I reached it.

I kicked about for a moment until</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had reached a position commanding a</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of the hut, and yet remain con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealed from view, groaned once more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then lay still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My strategy worked even better than</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had dared hope.

But why</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he shot Farley?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLEY LING stirred, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked weakly up at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You got me, damn you!" he hissed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But if you had been a little bit later--</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you had only been a little bit later!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What have you been doing?"

Charley Ling laughed a hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">derisive laugh.

This instrument was</seg><seg type="columnLine">connccted by means of two small wires to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground and to an automobile bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery which sat upon the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had to bury Farley myself, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an improvised coffin at that, and true</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Charley Ling's prediction the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">shocks continued for many days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three weeks later I landed in San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco.

For long</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain school of astronomers has held</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the moon is more pear-shaped than</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, with the larger and heavier por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion turned towards the earth and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalk of the pear, if one can call it that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing out into empty space. But Bo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kar's map showed that both the pear--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the spherical school were wrong. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">remoter side of our satellite was more or</seg><seg type="columnLine">less hollow, as though once that hemi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere had contained a vast sea which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dried up in the course of the ages. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain calculations we were able to make,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suggestion arose that the mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ados, taking into account its distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the moon, almost completely count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erbalanced the loss due to this concavity-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the moon. Whether those calcula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions were right or not I cannot say; I</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely record the facts as they were given</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me; at least they supply to a layman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like myself, a feasible solution of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The building of the earth space-fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">was well advanced and still no sign had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from Ados. It seemed as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been satisfied by that series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">raids made now many months before and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had drawn off, probably to perfect ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rangements before launching a final des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate attack on earth. Of course we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no means of knowing whether or</seg><seg type="columnLine">not we had been visited in the interval</seg><seg type="columnLine">by any spheres which had come purely</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a scouting expedition and managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep their presence hidden from our ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servers. Such a thing was not likely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nevertheless we had to admit that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">TERROR OUT OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a possibility, and far from being a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One evening a call from Han came over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the televisophone to Bo-Kar, a jubilant</seg><seg type="columnLine">message from his home planet to say that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secret of the green haze had at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">been run to ground by the Martian ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perimenters, and a means of nullifying it</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered. A full report would be ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside of twenty-four of our hours, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangements were made between the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">parties for recording instruments as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as for human observers to be ready the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next night at the New York end, to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceive the detailed information that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably go a long way towards bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about the final defeat of the Adosians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was in London myself at the time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">helping to put the finishing touches to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some work on the English side, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was not an eye-witness of what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened, but I had the full tale later from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spain and Bo-Kar, both of whom were</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Practically to the tick the two stations</seg><seg type="columnLine">got into communication, a slow enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">business when you remember that it took</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything from five to six minutes for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a message to pass from its source to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">destination.* After some preliminary con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation the Ilan station gave the signal</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the transmission of the report in full</seg><seg type="columnLine">detail was to start immediately. All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recording instruments were set ready, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aural and visual observers took their</seg><seg type="columnLine">places. There must be no possibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mistake now, and machines and human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings would act as a check on each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE formal beginning of the report</seg><seg type="columnLine">came through perfectly, but the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant it reached the vital stage, across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current of sound from Mars there cut a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsing rhythmic note, faintly musical,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet strong enough to drown completely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> • Mr. Harper is assuming that Mars was at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">period sixty million miles from Earth 13d that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves from the transmitting station were traveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">across space at the speed of light, i.e., 1S6.000 miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">per second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">everything that was being transmitted. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the first time that many of the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians had heard this note and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclined at first to put it down to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">species of atmospheric or cosmic inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spain, on the other hand, would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was nothing of the kind. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite positive, he declared, that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same species of transmission we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the night before our departure for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars, and he recalled, what Bo-Kar had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemingly forgotten for the moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">those warning signals we in the Tellus</seg><seg type="columnLine">had received and recorded on our way</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to earth. The records of these were</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the moment somewhere in the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visophonic station, and as the recording</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines were already at work the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimens could be compared later. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">even in the absence of this comparison</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spain had absolutely no doubt that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">present interference originated from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ados. His manner, more than anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">else, decided Bo-Kar, though probably the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian was more than half-convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">already, that this was a deliberate at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt at interference, expressly designed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prevent us getting hold of vital in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation. If that was so it indicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Adosians were possessed of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher degree of intelligence and a greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp of the problem confronting us, than</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had so far credited to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But to whatever the interference should</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultimately prove to be due, the fact re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained that all attempts to get the neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary information from Mars were un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful. Over a period of a week the</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York station was in almost constant</seg><seg type="columnLine">communication with Ilan; many messages</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed to and fro between the two sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. but the moment any reference was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made to the green haze or any other mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters relative to Ados the beams were</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In desperation it was decided to code</seg><seg type="columnLine">all messages. Far from having the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">58</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sired effect the experiment merely resulted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all communication between die two</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets being completely ait off. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">this in itself was bad enough, but, worse</seg><seg type="columnLine">still, it gave rise to the further disquiet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing suggestion that the Adosians had in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some fashion achieved a command of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rocan, sufficient at any rate to guess the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purport of all our messages. It was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea that led us at first to credit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adosians with powers they did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">possess. A feasible solution was offered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, when someone recollected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian ship that had been lost in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle in the void. Our presumption--</seg><seg type="columnLine">so strong as to be almost a certainty--</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been that the vessel, after breaking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two, had crashed on the planetoid and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew had been killed the moment the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped from die stricken vessel. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless we were to believe that the Ados-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ians possessed the miraculous power of</seg><seg type="columnLine">translating offhand a language utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">alien to them, there seemed a strong pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility that some at least of the crew of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stricken ship had escaped with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Additional force was lent to this idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we discovered that it was only when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conversation turned towards Ados and</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters relative to that planet that mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sages in Rocan were interrupted. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other hand messages in code or in</seg><seg type="columnLine">English were jammed right at the start.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Obviously then the Adosians were taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">no chances of anything getting over in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue they did not understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The net result of all this was that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one way we were hampered in our efforts;</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other hand if anything was needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to spur us on, we found it in the prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability that some of our Martian allies</seg><seg type="columnLine">were captives in the hands of the Ados-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was another result, one entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">unforeseen by us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The attack on the televisophonoc sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion outside New York came literally</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">without warning, the spheres dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on it out of a clear sky. Inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten seconds the station and its surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings were completely destroyed, and where</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been was left a devastated wilder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, covered a foot deep in a lava-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance that took long to cool. Fortu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nately the attack had been made during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day and at a time when there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparatively few people about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the realization that no satisfactory</seg><seg type="columnLine">communication between die two planets</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be kept up, owing to the Adosian</seg><seg type="columnLine">interference, the place had actually been</seg><seg type="columnLine">temporarily abandoned, only a skeleton</seg><seg type="columnLine">staff and an emergency operator being</seg><seg type="columnLine">retained. Bo-ICar and his staff were in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalled in quarters in Washington where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were conducting certain experiments</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose result will be noted later. Sad as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was to think that the skeleton staff had</seg><seg type="columnLine">literally been blasted into nothingness, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who took the wider view of the needs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hour, there was consolation in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that men, whom the two planets</seg><seg type="columnLine">could ill spare, had escaped death and</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CURIOUSLY enough the Adosian</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet seemed content with the wreck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the station, for, that completed, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared again into the void. In one</seg><seg type="columnLine">way this heartened us. It showed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">their preparations were by no means yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed. They evidently needed more</seg><seg type="columnLine">time before launching the fdl strength of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their Armada, though in the interval they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take every possible step to prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">us acquiring information likely to lead to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their defeat. It was a very natural con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusion that if we could manage to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the result of the Ilanian scientists' inves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tigation of the green haze, we would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our hands a weapon that would remove</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Adosian menace forever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My recall came while I was in London.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My space-ship, as well as all the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered round the world, was ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">TERROR OUT OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">59</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to rendezvous at once.

It was an ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rangement that had been made with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">full consent of the participating powers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it was felt that only in such fortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">districts could the task of camouflaging</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant craft be undertaken with any</seg><seg type="columnLine">degree of success.

The Roca</seg><seg type="columnLine">I judged, was already doomed; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer I balanced in indecision the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely we were to share her fate.

The Tellus responded instantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising so steeply that wc were almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown off our feet. The spheres seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be slipping down at an angle, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense distance beneath us, the void</seg><seg type="columnLine">aflame with the hell's light of their rays,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tellus into them glowing white-hot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">horribly visible now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the roar of our rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes, thunder on thunder, and under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kick of the reaction we sped like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">black bullet across the star-spangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness of space. It did not matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">now whether or not the Adosians could</seg><seg type="columnLine">locate us by means of their instruments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of detection. The gray-green stream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocket gas, drifting comet-like away</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind us, was ample advertisement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our presence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had the effect I expected, the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, in a way, I dreaded. Half of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres desisted from their destruction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Roca, snapped off their rays,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rotated, and came on hurrying after us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I watched the dial-hand of the speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">gauge anxiously, flashing every now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a glance back at the vision-plate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were taking all the acceleration we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could stand; in a little the rocket tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">must stop discharging lest we shake our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves to picces. It remained to be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">what speed the spheres could reach. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were too far away for their rays to</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch us yet, but if we could not show</seg><seg type="columnLine">them a clean pair of heels, a few hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">would see us looking our last upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">round of space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time the spheres seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaining on us, and our hearts stood still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the more so now as the thundering of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocket tubes had died away. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reached our peak of acceleration; in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this frictionless void we could hold our</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed forever if necessary, but we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet to learn whether the spheres could</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach a higher pitch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked away.

Five long</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes dragged wearily by before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would permit myself another glance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I might have been mistaken, but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be holding them.

Is not that what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you call it?''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A great light dawned on me. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean," I said, "that he will transmit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us the image of the written mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sages?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thee . . . thee formula, yes," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martian, nodding vigorously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Why hadn't we thought of that be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore? The one way to overcome the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adosian interference. They could lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten in on all our spoken messages, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jam them if and when they thought fit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But unless they had remarkably sensitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments, the televisioned formula for</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroying the green haze and all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it implied could not be intercepted, much</seg><seg type="columnLine">less interfered with. Its reception, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, would occupy no more than an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant of time, not a matter of long min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes like the spoken word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even when wc had the formula,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what good would it be to us now? A</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrier of spheres stretched between us</seg><seg type="columnLine">and earth. We could not, dare not run</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gauntlet with so precious a cargo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fool that I was. We could re-transmit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to earth, of course. But even in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a snag. The picture-recording,</seg><seg type="columnLine">camera-like machines, with their sensitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">plates, must be rigged ready to receive</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impression. The various earth sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions should be warned in advance, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not see how I could do so. Any</seg><seg type="columnLine">message that could not be transmitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantaneously would almost certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">be jammed. I did think of transmitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the picture record on the off-chance of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the stations at least receiving it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and making assurance doubly sure by</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitting again at regular intervals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I decided that would be taking too</seg><seg type="columnLine">great a risk. The first transmission</seg><seg type="columnLine">might not be recorded--I was practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain that it would not be--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following ones were bound to be inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered with. It was too big a problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me to work out unaided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Martian turned from the screen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is finished, sir," he said. "Thee pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture has come through."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Good. Rush it to the developing</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. I want a dozen prints s quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as possible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sailed and was turning to go with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the box camera-like affair tucked under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm. when I called to him. "By</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way," I said, "as you go, send the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief Rocan operator here to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went. A little later the Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">operator came and I put my problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. He shook his head. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">of no way of overcoming the difficulty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The chances, in his estimation, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">that even a single instantaneous trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission would not get through. Where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I had visualized the Adosian inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference as a sort of directional beam cut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting knife-likc across our lines of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munication, he pictured it more as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of concentric rings, a kind of eddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of force palpitating out in all directions</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the point of origin. Most probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was right. In which case there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one thing left us to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our acceleration had carried us well</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the Martian fleet and now we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">slewing around in a wide circle to join</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with them. I called the Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">commander on the televisiophone, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">got through. Apparently the Adosian</seg><seg type="columnLine">field of interference did not extend so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far into space, nevertheless I felt afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the retreating spheres might be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to intercept our signals if in Rocan, so:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Is there anyone on board who can</seg><seg type="columnLine">TERROR OUT OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">speak English?" I asked of the face in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vision plate. The commander him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, for it was to him I was speaking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">intimated that he did. Probably he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learnt it when we were on Mars, either</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the records or from Thrang</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. Which did not matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, secure in the knowledge that</seg><seg type="columnLine">our English conversation would be un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligible to the Adosians, I told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">briefly, as simply and as plainly as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, what I intended doing, and asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his co-operation. I got it without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second's hesitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Briefly the situation was this: The</seg><seg type="columnLine">constant researches of the Martian sci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">entists had evolved a formula showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nature of Ados's protecting haze,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that also showed how to nullify</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. The Martian fleet en route to earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">had received this formula by televisio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone but a few days before. Unfor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunately they were helpless in the sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they lacked the materials necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">to construct the apparatus that would de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">molish the haze. Such things were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">normally among the stores carried on</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-ships. But, given the materials</seg><seg type="columnLine">and such a work-shop as could be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth or Mars, the required instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments could be constructed in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours. If I could get the formula into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hands of my colleagues, enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment for all our space-ships in</seg><seg type="columnLine">commission could be ready by the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fleet we had just met readied earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our plans made, the Martian and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">disconnected. I used the interval of</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting in acquainting all on board with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation. Sooner almost than I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected, the vision-plate showed me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian fleet beginning to move off. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly from out of their midst one gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing golden ship shot forward, the gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">green streams of gas from the rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhausts marking its passage across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">void. It was headed earthwards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I allowed the Tellus to fall behind the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet, and not until the ships were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long way ahead did I dare start our</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket engines. But then I managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make acceleration under the cover of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas streams from the other ships. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time T had nearly drawn level with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them I was able to cut out the engines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with the impetus already received</seg><seg type="columnLine">forge steadily ahead. The Tellus, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible now, lifted in a long slant, passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the massed ships and headed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthwards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile the single ship which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped on ahead had attracted the atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the spheres. They had halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their headlong retreat to Ados, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could almost imagine them debating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation. Despite their superior</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers, they were seemingly not anx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious to engage the entire fleet. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">they fancied the Martian ships might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped with unpleasant surprises in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way of novel or untried weapons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or more probably, like the Martian com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mander himself, they had orders not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">precipitate a general conflict.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the intentions of this lone ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">were seemingly obvious. It was streak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for earth, carrying information that</seg><seg type="columnLine">must not be allowed to get there. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a speed so quick that it almost dazzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eyes, the Adosians altered their for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation. Half a dozen ships detached</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves from the bunch, set off in</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuit of the earthward-bound Martian,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while others wheeled about and strung</seg><seg type="columnLine">across in the path of the oncoming fleet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green rays in their invisible infra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">red carrier beams licking out suggest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ively. The Martian line slowed, halted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavered -- and slowly, reluctantly it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed, slewed round on their course.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The way was barred. The odds against</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were too powerful to contend with.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That, at least, must have been the Ado-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sians' reading of their actions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lone Martian ship, despite its</seg><seg type="columnLine">start, showed signs of flagging. It looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as though the pursuers would speedily</seg><seg type="columnLine">run it down. It, too, paused uncertainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its flight, zig-zagging to escape the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutching fingers of the beams, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubling like a hunted hare came round</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a wide circle that would bring it back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its parent fleet far out beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outermost fringe of the wide-flung Ado-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sian fleet. The pursuing spheres whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">round as though to cut it off, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve it cut was too large for them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope to run it down before it reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the. rest of the fleet. The spheres flagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the race and one by one they began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drift back to the main line drawn like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a barrier between earth and the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tian dctachraent. But they must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt satisfied that they had managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">preveul any message reaching earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, so beautifully had it all been</seg><seg type="columnLine">timed, at the very moment that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunted Martian wheeled out on the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve to rejoin the fleet, drawing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adosians after her, the Tellus invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her black paint, was speeding swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">far up over the spot where pursuer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pin-sued had been but a moment before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heading out for earth and safety. Strat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">egy had succeeded where force was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">no avail. The maneuver had achieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">its purpose of drawing off possible pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit during the vital few minutes neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary for us to get a flying start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had no hope that it would last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however. Even now the Adosians must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be discovering that the agitation of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">detecting instruments was due to some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing other than the maneuvers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodging Martian. In a little while,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they could not sec us, they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">get our direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They did, sooner than I expected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Looking back I saw a movement in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of spheres, saw some detach them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves from the main body and come</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaking in a dead straight line for us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had got our direction of flight then.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Speed was the one thing that could save</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">us, and since concealment was no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary, I rang for full explosions on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocket tubes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Tellus trembled in every rivet as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we hurtled through space, yet despite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous speed we must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">making we did not seem to be gaining.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The spheres were certainly showing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn of speed I had not anticipated. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite six hours they held us, even at</seg><seg type="columnLine">times seemed to be gaining a little, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for every second of that time my heart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that of nearly everyone else on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board, was in my mouth. I don't think,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, that any of them--fortunately</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their peace of mind--visualized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibilities I did. Our repelling rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">would warn us of approaching meteor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ites and deal with them in the accepted</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, but I dreaded to think of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">would happen if another line of spheres</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly showed up ahead of us. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be impossible at the rate we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to avoid them, and a head-on col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lision would see us all blown into in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">candescent dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir"--a voice at my elbow brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">me up all standing--"thee prints are</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was that wonderfully efficient Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tian officer back from the developing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room with a dozen dry prints in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think some of us cheered. Someone else</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a cry of dismay. At the very mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, when victory of a sort seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">within our grasp, the tide bade fair to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn against us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From behind Ados, from that face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it which we had never seen, there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtling sphere after sphere in a never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ending stream, thousands of spheres,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounding the planetoid high above us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravening birds of prey dropping down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to overwhelm us by sheer force of num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers.

"They'll be on us if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we don't watch out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was true. The lower spheres, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely out of control, were falling di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly towards us.

I fancied from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">look of things that their gravitational</seg><seg type="columnLine">screens were still running automatically,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and until the power governing them ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">out they would flutter down rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was now more or less each ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">for itself, and in the absence of spe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cific orders I did what I thought best.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We easily cleared the lower spheres, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others above were still under con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol. The dead-white carrier ray of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyzing beams had not reached them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they could not get at us because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the blanket of their own craft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moment we emerged from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket, however, they began to strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">at us with their green rays.

It took a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of seconds for the green pencil to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and heat up its objective to the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">of incandescence. On the other hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our paralyzing ray. on which we pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred to rely at this juncture rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than on the red heat beams, acted at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. The carrier took them right</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the outer shells of the spheres,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the vacuum space between, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the inner shells, plunging their</seg><seg type="columnLine">crews into a state of coma instantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We did not have it all our own way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every now and then a green ray cling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing tenaciously to a planetarian ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sent it off in a burst of incandescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust.

But they</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be out of control, for they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were drifting aimleslsy about. One I</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed particularly. Something had</seg><seg type="columnLine">started it rotating and as it swept round</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its own axis, the green ray, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stained finger sticking out from it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled round and round, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spheres beneath us were less</seg><seg type="columnLine">massed now. We could see Ados, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, too, tliat while a section of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet was engaging them, another section</seg><seg type="columnLine">was apparently training the anti-mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">netic power oil the planetoid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The green haze dipped and swayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarmingly. Its high lights had died</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost completely away, though every</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then like the embers of a burnt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out fire, they flared for an instant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">life again. Yet the force rays generated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by our fleet were gaining.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mindful of what the mechanic had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, I watched fascinated. ' I had noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing else to do. We were merely hover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing now. and the mechanic was doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work, sending paralyzing ray or heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam stabbing this way and that as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity offered. So it was that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a section of that last act of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drama.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of a sudden the green haze screen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gigantic bubble, swelled to enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportions, became so tenuous that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see through it, and abruptly van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished as though it had never been. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment the planetoid seemed to rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a great blast of air roaring upwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">into space drove through the spheres and</seg><seg type="columnLine">inter-planetary ships alike, scattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">them like chaff before the wind. We, in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tellus, seemed to be thrown every</seg><seg type="columnLine">which way at once, but luckily none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us were hurt. I picked myself up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once and jumped to the control, afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we would be hurled up against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">under surface of the moon and dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pieces. But the blast had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong enough for that, and. as I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tellus back on her course, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to descend to our former level,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw that others of our ships were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being brought about in their turn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Ados seemed different as we drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">near it. The green haze was gone. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were looking down on a bleak, bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. I think I jumped Lo the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusion then and there. Afterward</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the spheres were captured, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">since they still contained air some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crews were alive, though in a state</seg><seg type="columnLine">of temporary paralysis. They were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only live Adosians we saw. The value</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their capture, however, lay in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that we put the Martian thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines on them and thus obtained</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough information to supplement what</seg><seg type="columnLine">we discovered of our own accord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ages ago, it seemed, Ados had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere, but like the moon its air</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventually began to escape into space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Adosian, being a slothful enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature, apparently was content as long</seg><seg type="columnLine">as science found a means of retaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">that atmosphere. The difficulty was</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved by the production of a power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling extending all over the planet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Air, water and food were made syn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thetically as natural supplies failed, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not until with the passage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">long centuries the natural elements from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the synthetic products were made</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to fail, that the Adosian bestirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself sufficiently to look for an alter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">native to the extinction that faced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">race. Frantic experiments covering a</seg><seg type="columnLine">period of about eighty or ninety of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">years culminated at last in the construc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the progenitor of the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">TERROR OUT OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres. They were extremely clumsy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however; the first ones that went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">were lost in space, but spurred on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">further efforts by the threat of doom</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging over their heads, the Adosians</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last evolved a reliable article. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">began exploration. Earth, as the nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitable body, offered them exceptional</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantages. The difficulty of increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity there could be overcome arti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficially and probably the race would</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner or later evolve a type that could</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand the gravitational pull of the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">without any undue discomfort. That,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at any rate, was their theory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a desperate chance the Ado-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sians were taking, and they put long</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of preparation into their work</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they dared make a move. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then at the last, when they seemed with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in measurable distance of making their</seg><seg type="columnLine">one ruthless stroke, the uncounted factor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Martian conquest of space ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to upset their plans. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to proceed more slowly and more cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiously because of that, for quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrongly, as we know, they sensed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martians rivals for the possession</seg><seg type="columnLine">of earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The power curtain was charged with</seg><seg type="columnLine">those repelling influences that made it</seg><seg type="columnLine">an effective armor for the surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planetoid, and under its protection</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparations went forward on even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaster scale than before. But for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky accident of Bo-Kar kidnapping us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Adosians would probably have suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceded in subjugating earth first and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other planets in their turn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">*****</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE came down to the surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ados after the battle, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible to venture forth without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">protective space-suit equipment. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanic had been wrong when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">asserted that the force beams we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed against the green screen would</seg><seg type="columnLine">shatter Ados as they had shattered the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres. He had overlooked several</seg><seg type="columnLine">vital facts. The spheres were hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies with an atmospheric pressure in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of roughly about fifteen pounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the square inch and the vacuum of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space outside. The walls of the spheres,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, had been built to withstand</seg><seg type="columnLine">that pressure from inside and stand rigid</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a force that constantly strove to</seg><seg type="columnLine">split them asunder. The effect of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">force beams was to press the walls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spheres inwards against that pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, and in pressing them relentlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">it weakened them so that they simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew to pieces. Ados, on the other hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a solid body.

But every state has its scandals</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this type.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a very select institution, catering</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the wealthiest patients, and the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">fees Dr. Grimshaw secured from them</seg><seg type="columnLine">enabled him to establish a charity ward</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which, with admirable public spirit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he labored to improve the condition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the indigent feeble-minded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Grimshaw appears to have effected</seg><seg type="columnLine">some remarkable cures in insanity cases;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">several well-attested instances of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete recovery from paranoia are rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orded under his ministrations. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time it was noted that a good many</seg><seg type="columnLine">patients died at his sanitarium, and later</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigation revealed that these belonged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to two classes--wealthy patients whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">relatives were at a great distance, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">both poor and wealthy patients who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no relatives at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the case of Harlan Ward that</seg><seg type="columnLine">led to the scandal.

Some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">after this, while his wife and parents</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in Europe they received a cable-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gram from Dr. Grimshaw announcing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the death of the young man.

Pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers found in the safe of the Grim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaw Sanitarium showed beyond doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it had been made the headquarters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a gang engaged in distributing nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cotics, and that both Dr. Grimshaw and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Voyna were deeply engaged in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">traffic. It was undoubtedly at the san-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itarium itself that Harland Ward had</seg><seg type="columnLine">contracted the drug habit that proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ruin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of the other facts uncovered by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police there were two of such singular</seg><seg type="columnLine">character that the present manuscript</seg><seg type="columnLine">appears to afford the only adequate ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planation for them, however fantastic it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may seem.

The other, and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinary fact, was that Dr. Grim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaw, through a chain of agents, seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have been engaged in the peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">business of supplying circuses and vaude-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ville impressarios with dwarfs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most of these midgets (as is not un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual) were morons, and many of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were both drug-users and drug-peddlers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Voyna ultimately received a jail</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentence of five years; the heaviest al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowable for dope peddling under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laws of the United States. Grimshaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">was never apprehended. W'arned no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt by the first newspaper accounts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bursting of the Ward casket, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took to flight and has not been found</seg><seg type="columnLine">since. If he is ever arrested it is doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful whether any charge but drug-ped-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dling will lie against him. The laws of</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York require that a body shall be</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced before a charge of murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be substantiated, the corpus delicti,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as we have stated not one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies of his victims has been found.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Investigation of the doctor's past career</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that he had been a graduate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Heidelberg and Jena where he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">high honors in endocrinology, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he later lost his German license on ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count of malpractice.

It was essen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tial that extra protection be provided,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was locked with him in the bag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gage car. The journey was a long one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the motion of the train soporific. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose I dozed; I was wakened by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flicker of motion as the messenger drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun, and we both fired at practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same moment.

He did--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my infinite cost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the sanitarium I was given a pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant room and very little by way of oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupation. I was kept in at all times save</seg><seg type="columnLine">during meals and for a short period in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the afternoon, when all the patients were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken for exercise to a large park or</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden, with a small stream running</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it. During this period I en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countered Arthur Kaye, a large man</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a high forehead, who was under</seg><seg type="columnLine">treatment for dipsomania; a man named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kraicki, a decayed Polish aristocrat of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort who was troubled apparently with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chronic weak-mindedness; Sherman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interne in charge of our wing, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom I felt considerably drawn by</seg><seg type="columnLine">common tastes in literature and art.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was little to do in the park</seg><seg type="columnLine">but to sit and talk with these three. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed a more or less self-sustaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">group, somewhat separated from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other patients and internes about us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time, we attempted to amuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves by playing bridge, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">resource proved futile. Kraicki was</seg><seg type="columnLine">totally incapable of keeping his mind on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the game, ahd would ask the most ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surdly naive questions about what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should do when he held four aces. Nat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urally, the enforced idleness began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">become somewhat wearisome. I am of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an intensely' active temperament, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">have led an active life, and I began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cudgel my brains for something to do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even a covert breaking of rules struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">me as a fascinating occupation; at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would provide me with something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan and accomplish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Searching about for a rule to break in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most interesting way, I hit on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem of the wall. At the left side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the park a high stone wall separated</seg><seg type="columnLine">our bourne from that where the charity</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">patients were confined. Sherman re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked one day that nobody but Grim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaw himself, and his leading assistant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Voyna, were allowed beyond it, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building in which the charity patients</seg><seg type="columnLine">were kept was only connected with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main body of the sanitarium by a kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of covered passage. To get over that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall and solve the mystery of the seclu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of the charity patients--that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be an enterprise worthy of accomplish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So one afternoon, just before we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">called for the regular period of exercise,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I arranged a dummy in my bed. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exercise period, as we emerged from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dining room, a more or less disorder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly group, I slipped around a comer into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the operating room and waited behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door till the attendants, who brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the rear of the procession, had passed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then back into the dining room, and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the %vindows into the park again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There T concealed myself in a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of maples by the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream until darkness came. I knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night attendant in the halls would flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lamp through the peep-hole in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of my room, but trusted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dummy (as I have many times done in</seg><seg type="columnLine">detective work) to deceive him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the lights in the building went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, I searched along the wall until I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a tree growing against it, scaled</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with some little difficulty and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on the other side. I found myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in another exercise yard--not so large</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor so well carpeted with grass as ours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and without the stream. It was entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut in by a lofty wall, crowned with</seg><seg type="columnLine">spikes on every side save that where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The windows of the charity patients'</seg><seg type="columnLine">building were barred like ours. Think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing myself more or less of a fool and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my adventure a rather paltry one, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried the door, more to assure myself of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impossibility of entering than for</seg><seg type="columnLine">84</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">any other reason. To my surprise it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlocked. In the lower hall, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single dim light, but the building was</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent save for a subdued moaning from</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere upstairs. The maniacs who</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed Dr. Grimshaw's more serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases were usually making some noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that sort, so I gave the matter no</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was about to try the upper floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see what I could observe through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peep-holes, when I heard the grating of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a key in the lock at the end of the cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered passage. The outer door was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">far away to be attempted with any pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect of success. I must find conceal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and quickly. Fortunately a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes hamper stood in the hall . Into it</seg><seg type="columnLine">I leaped, and by the grace of the gods,</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it empty save for a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">towels. Through its sides I could get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat imperfect view of the hall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I saw that the newcomers were three</seg><seg type="columnLine">in number--Grimshaw, Voyna and a boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of aboyt twelve, I should judge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They passed me so closely that their</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes brushed my place of concealment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they turned on the light in the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">by whose door the hamper stood. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to see what they were doing, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grimshaw's voice rose sharp and clear:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'd better be reasonable and take</seg><seg type="columnLine">your medicine. It will relieve the pain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A second voice replied, "But I won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">take it, I tell you. I know what it is, it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">dope. You can do what you like; you</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a midget out of me, but you ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to make no dope fiend out of me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The voice was neither Grimshaw's nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Voyna's; I had heard both often enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It must therefore belong to the boy, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the startling connotation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech struck me--it was no boy but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarf or midget.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You won't take it, eh?" said Grim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaw, with a kind of suppressed fury</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his voice, "I'll show you!'' and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the sound of a blow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No I won't," said the voice, rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">near tears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a minute," (this was Voyna</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking) "That's not the way, Grim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaw.

He's peddling dope--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">his speech was broken by the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of another blow, and somewhere, one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the maniac patients began to shout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut the door, will you, Ben?" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grimshaw, and that was the last I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My muscles were cramped by the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finement, but I lost no time in escap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the hamper and the building. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered whether they had been giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">me drugs in my food; how many of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanitarium's employees were in on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">business; and what lay behind all these</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinister manifestations. "You made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">midget out of me"--what could it mean.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I judged, however, that Sherman was</seg><seg type="columnLine">honest enough, else he would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted to whatever grisly secrets the</seg><seg type="columnLine">charity building held.

I was not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, but it didn't look like it, if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to coerce the dwarf into taking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dope. And then, the whole thing might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the result of a maniac's imagination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I had no guarantee the dwarf was sane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless, I slept beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees that night. I feared that I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">run into Grimshaw or Voyna in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">halls, and if they were actually engaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in any such shady business as it seemed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">DR. GRIMSHAW'S SANITARIUM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">85</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">such an encounter would be dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the last degree. In the morning I</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered by the same way I had left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building, hid in the operating room</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and joined the crowd at breakfast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after which I went to my room and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed the dummy. Just what to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a problem, but I reasoned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sherman would tell me better than any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body else what lay behind it, for even</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he were not involved, he could add</seg><seg type="columnLine">much corroborative information to what</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of the events I had. If he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should prove one of the gang, then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must trust to strength and speed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That afternoon, during the exercise</seg><seg type="columnLine">period, I told him the whole story. Kaye</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Kraicki hung around and heard it</seg><seg type="columnLine">too--somehow I couldn't seem to get rid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" said Sherman, when I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished, "So that's why . . and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's why what?" T asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why no one but Voyna is allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the charity wing or on the third floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this building," he said. "I always</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it was queer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But are you sure they're not putting</seg><seg type="columnLine">drugs in our food?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave a little laugh. "Hardly pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible," he said. "There are too many</seg><seg type="columnLine">people here and too many visitors. No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would be crude. Moreover, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">are too many internes here. Someone</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be sure to notice the taste. Tt</seg><seg type="columnLine">is very characteristic."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was a relief, at all events. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the question of whether Grimshaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Voyna were actually engaged in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drug traffic, Sherman seemed not quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain, but judged that the best pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cedure would be to certify me cured, get</seg><seg type="columnLine">me out and let me return with search</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrants and police and check up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mysterious charity ward. Leaving</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the problem at that point, we went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The table was unusually quiet that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, and I imagine it must have grated</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Kraicki's rather frayed nerves. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">all events, before any of us could check</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he burst out with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know what's the matter. They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">all mad at you, Dr. Grimshaw, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">you peddle dope." I slid a plate to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, where it broke with a crash, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was too late--my action only served</seg><seg type="columnLine">to emphasize the indiscretion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech. Crimshaw darted a sudden look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at us, and making some excuse, left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. Trouble was in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the meal, the doctor summoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kraicki to his office. I knew things</seg><seg type="columnLine">would very likely be stirring that night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I did not even bother to undress;</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely turned out my light, and waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the door for what was coming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sure enough, along about one o'clock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door creaked slowly open, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand holding a flashlight was extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the aperture. I snatched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist, pulling the holder clear in and off</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance with my left hand, at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time striking out with all my force with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other hand. My blow struck full</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the intruder's face and he went down</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though pole-axed. But Grimshaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been fully forearmed. As the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">man went down, a second gripped me by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knees, and when I bent to care for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, a third leaped on my back. I put</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a good battle, but they were too many</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me. They got me down and strapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight, and not till then did someone turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the light. I saw Grimshaw standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">over me, dabbing a blooded mouth with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his handkerchief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So!" he said, and I could not but</seg><seg type="columnLine">admire the man's calmness. "You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">delusions of persecution. You imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am trying to give you and other pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tients cocaine.

You will have to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">another treatment--a long one, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doherty." He looked incredibly benign-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant. I began to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, come, don't excite yourself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to give you something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet your nerves," he said, and flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a hypodermic with which he pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded to give me an injection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I lost consciousness under the effects</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the drug, and when I recovered it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. I woke in a different room;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it must have been on the third floor, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forbidden floor, for I could see the tops</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trees beyond the bar,red window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was kept there for a long time;</seg><seg type="columnLine">just how long I am uncertain for I lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">all count of the hours. During most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the period I was in a straight-jacket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and once I was operated on, somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the front of the skull, for I recollect</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head being held firmly in a plaster</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast after the operation, and an infinite</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of nausea as the effect of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">anaesthetic wore off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every day a rough looking chap fed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me from a spoon, and every night Grim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaw returned to give me another hypo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dermic injection. I felt terribly ill and</seg><seg type="columnLine">depressed all that time. In the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would wake with a blinding head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ache that would last out the day, leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me weak as a kitten. I began to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velop hallucinations, too. The room</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to grow perceptibly in size, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strait jacket became looser.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day, when I felt better than usual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I made an attempt to wriggle out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">now thoroughly loosened straight-jacket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It succeeded, and I lay still on the bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a mood of profound self-congratula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. When Grimshaw entered I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise and strike him to the floor--a poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">revenge, but better than none. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was always the chance of getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the opened door, out and away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But all my dreams came to nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was so weakened by long confinement</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and pain that he handled me as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I were a child--and here, again. I noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curious thing. He seemed at least a</seg><seg type="columnLine">head taller than I; and I am a six-footer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How could that be? Drugs were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only explanation I could fit to it at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The period succeeding this futile at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt to escape is all a haze for me, shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">by macabre impressions. I remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">once being taken out on the balcony for</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, and once imagining that I saw Kaye</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the next balcony, muffled in a straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacket even as I was. But there could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be no certainty, and the muffled figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not speak. And the dreams!--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams! I imagined myself as light as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feather. Great giants wandered about</seg><seg type="columnLine">my room with huge weapons in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands; hideous creatures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My first clear consciousness was when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grimshaw told us all about it. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">night the evening meal was not fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed by the usual injection and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning brought the first surcease from</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain in--God alone knows how long. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">woke with my eyes on a ceiling that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed miles overhead, and when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the foot of the bed it ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to have retreated to an infinite</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance. The room was gigantic. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grimshaw came in a moment later.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He carried a bundle in his arms, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wondering eyes, he looked fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet tall. He came right over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed, and deposited his bundle there, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with infinite astonishment, I saw it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arthur Kaye, that big man with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high forehead, yet small enough to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried like a habv by a Dr. Grimshaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown titanic in size. A few moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">later the doctor returned with another</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle and then a third--and they con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained Sherman and Kraicki, as the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">had contained Kaye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked down at us with a kindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile for a moment, and then began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout.

You are the subjects of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">classical experiment--one that will un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtedly place me in the front rank of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world's endocrinologists, and will</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand your names down to posterity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'You, Dr. Sherman, will have already</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood the nature of the experiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">I liave performed. To the rest I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer a few words of explanation, suit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to their somewhat limited intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gences. There are certain glands in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, gentlemen, which are called thy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roid, parathyroid and pituitary glands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are known as the ductless glands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and have no obvious function. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been discovered that if the pituitary</seg><seg type="columnLine">or thyroid glands of a young animal, say</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sheep or dog, are destroyed, the animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be a dwarf; in other words, these</seg><seg type="columnLine">glands in some way unknown to most</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists, control the growth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Investigation has also shown that an</seg><seg type="columnLine">injured pituitary or thyroid gland in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human individual produces equally curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous results--giants, seven-footers seen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">circuses, being the product of insufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">gland activity. Even in adults these</seg><seg type="columnLine">glands are known to produce certain ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fects. Dr. Haussler has recorded how</seg><seg type="columnLine">an abnormally active pituitary gland</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused a man's fingers to become short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide and stubby, long after he was fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These endocrine glands cause their</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes by releasing certain substances</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the blood stream, among them being</seg><seg type="columnLine">various enzymes or yeasts, which by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">complicated series of chemical reactions</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring about the changes indicated. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have given my life to the investigation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these glands and their enzymes. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">will gratify you, Dr. Sherman, to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I have investigated over three</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred cases of dwarfism and giantism,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making elaborate blood and X-ray exam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inations. In time I became convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a certain enzyme, which I call</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Theta" was responsible for all known</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases of dwarfism. I have isolated</seg><seg type="columnLine">enzyme theta and found that a normally</seg><seg type="columnLine">active pituitary body secretes and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leases a counteracting enzyme to it, thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">preserving the balance of the body. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">then became a question whether I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce artificial dwarfism by damag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the pituitary body and introducing</seg><seg type="columnLine">enzyme theta by subcutaneous injection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Animals did not give satisfactory re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sults. Hence I was led to establish the</seg><seg type="columnLine">charity ward of this sanitarium and, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment, secured a number of feeble-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded human specimens, whose absence</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be noted. I have succeeded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">producing midgets as small as two feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten inches in height by this means. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunately it was impossible to release</seg><seg type="columnLine">them into the world as normal midgets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the civilization of this country being so</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward that scientific investigation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man as an animal is actually punish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. Therefore I have introduced these</seg><seg type="columnLine">midgets to the delights of cocaine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintain my control over them by fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nishing their supply of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But with you gentlemen I decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">conduct the experiment on an altogether</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher plane.

Consequently, I have decided,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by carcfully graduating the dosage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">enzyme theta, to produce in you a series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hyper-midgets.

At the border of the stream we</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a chair that one of the internes</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have left behind, and with it not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only his medicine case, but a book, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">writing paper and a bottle of ink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was treasure-trove indeed.

Beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">various oddments of no utility to us, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained a bottle of quinine capsules,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were just what we wanted.

The paper was a wash-out, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever.

By great good for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune the book was Brinkley's "History</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Japan--india paper. With Sherman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">help I got a couple of the fly-leaves loose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he had gone off with one when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up and saw the menacing shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man in the distance--Grimshaw, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, though from his height and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance, I could not be certain. Leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paper behind I fled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I doubt whether I would have writ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten this record even then but for what</seg><seg type="columnLine">has happened since. We were com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortably domiciled under our root in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">park, living off grasshoppers (of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">there seemed an unending supply) and</seg><seg type="columnLine">making preparations for the winter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once we even caught a mole, stabbed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to death with our glass swords, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">skinned it laboriously. It furnished us</seg><seg type="columnLine">both good food and clothing. Sherman</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed uncanny skill with such poor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">needles as we could contrive, and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kraicki contributed to the general fund</seg><seg type="columnLine">of welfare by the discovery that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow hearts of grass stems have a de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">licious flavor when baked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But three days ago there came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">change. Sherman and Kraicki were out</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting together. I was in our home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying out some darts I had made with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragments of wood and glass points,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Sherman hurst in, panting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed and very pale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter?" I asked, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">where's Kraicki?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gone," he said. "Grimshaw's got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat.

There is</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more hope for us. All that remains</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a chance, however remote, that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">capsules will fall into the hands of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">not too skeptical individual who will take</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trouble to investigate--the shadowy</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of a delayed revenge which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall not live to see.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">third school insisted that, though this</seg><seg type="columnLine">might eventually happen, the only im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediate change was that possibly the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">would gradually develop into a variable</seg><seg type="columnLine">star, though not at all probably of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cepheid type.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strangely enough no one suspected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">real truth until 1963, when my father,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was even then a brilliant spectro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scopist, dropped the proverbial bomb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell.

Above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fall there were only surging sheets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water, broken here and there by</seg><seg type="columnLine">points of rock wreathed with green</seg><seg type="columnLine">boughs; below, there was only a dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirlpool of tumultuous waters, crowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a thick cloud of damp vapor, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">striped with all the colors of the rain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow.

Then, as he knew the reputation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the native hunter, Mokoum, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompanied Anderson in his hunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">expeditions in Western Africa and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intrepid David Livingstone on his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey of exploration to Lake Ngami</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the falls of the Zambesi, he offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the command of this same caravan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This done, it was arranged that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushman, who knew the country perfect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, should lead William Emery along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks of the Orange to the Morgheda</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falls, the place appointed for the sci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">entific commission to join them. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">commission was to take its passage in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the British frigate Augusta, to reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth of the Orange on the western</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast of Africa, as high as Cape Vol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tas, and to ascend the river as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cataracts.

Here he was, far away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">any inhabited spot, on the banks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Orange river, a river as yet but little</seg><seg type="columnLine">explored. He was waiting for Euro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peans, fellow countrymen who had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">their homes to run the risks of a distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition. But what was the expedition</seg><seg type="columnLine">for? What scientific problem could it</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to solve in the deserts of South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Africa? What observation could it be</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to take in lat. 30°? That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just what Mr. Airy, the director of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greenwich Observatory, did not tell in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his letter. As for Emery himself they</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked for his co-operation, as for that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scientific man who was familiar with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the climate of those southern latitudes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as he was engaged in scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">labors, he was quite at the disposal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his colleagues in the United Kingdom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the young astronomer lay musing</seg><seg type="columnLine">over all these thing, and asking himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand questions which he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer, his eyelids became heavy, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at length he slept soundly. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">awoke, the sun was already hidden be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the western hills, whose picturesque</seg><seg type="columnLine">outline stood out sharply against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright horizon. Some gnawings of hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger told him that supper-time was near;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was, in fact, six o'clock, and just the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour for returning to the wagon at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the valley. At that very mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment a report resounded from a grove</seg><seg type="columnLine">or arborescent heather, from twelve to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen feet high, growing along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope of the hills on the right. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most immediately the bushman and Top</seg><seg type="columnLine">made their appearance at the edge of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wood, the former dragging behind him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the animal he had just shot.

It was joy to him to take in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poetry of these vast solitudes, and to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh his mind, so wearied with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mathematical speculations; and so he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guiled the tediousness of his waiting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and became a new man, both in mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and body. Thus did the novelty of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation explain his unvarying patience,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the bushman could not share in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the least; so there were continually on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the part of Mokoum the same recrim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inations, and on the part of Emery the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same quiet answers, which, however, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not quiet the nervous hunter in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smallest degree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now the 31st of January had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come, the last day fixed in Airy's letter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the expected party did not then ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rive, Emery would be in a very embar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rassing position; the delay might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">indefinitely prolonged.

Mokoum climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the bank again, and they determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wait in that place, as they could eas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily see down the river from there. Half</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour passed, which to Emery, in spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his calmness, appeared interminable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ever so many times he fancied he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dim outline of a boat gliding along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, but he was always mistaken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last an exclamation from the bush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man made his heart leap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Smoke!" cried Mokoum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking in the direction indicated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bushman, Emery could see a light</seg><seg type="columnLine">streak rolling round the bend of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river; there was no longer any doubt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The vessel advanced rapidly, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could soon make out the funnel pouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth a torrent of black smoke mingling</seg><seg type="columnLine">with white steam.

The vessel was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">about seven miles from the Falls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morgheda. It was then twelve o'clock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as it was not a good place for land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, the astronomer determined to return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the foot of the cataract; he told his</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan to the hunter, who only answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by turning back along the path he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just cleared along the left bank of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream. Emery followed, and, turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">round for the last time at a bend in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, saw the British flag floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the stern of the vessel. The re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to the falls was soon effected, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an hour's time the bushman and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomer halted a quarter of a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the cataract; for there the shore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollowed into a semicircle, formed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little cove, and as the water was deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">right up to the bank, the steamboat could</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily land its passengers. The vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be far off now, and it had cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly gained on the two pedestrians,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although they had walked so fast; it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet in sight, for the lofty trees which</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung quite over the river-banks into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, and the slope of the banks them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves, did not allow of an extensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">view. But although they could not hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound made by the steam, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsing of the machinery broke in dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinctly on the monotonous roar of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cataract; and as the whistling continued,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was evident that it was a signal from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat to announce its arrival near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">falls. The hunter replied by letting off</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun, the report being repeated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crash by the echoes of the shore. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">last the vessel was in sight, and William</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emery and his companion were seen by</seg><seg type="columnLine">those on board. At a sign from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomer the vessel turned, and glided</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly alongside the bank; a rope was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown ashore, which the bu simian</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized and twisted round the broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">stump of a tree, and immediately a tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">man sprang lightly on the bank, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">went towards the astronomer, whilst his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions landed in their turn.

William</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emery knew all this, and had therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">never doubted that the commission would</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrive on the appointed day.

All these were</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed on the bank; and the engine, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">8-horsepower, was divided into three</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts: the boiler and its tubes; the mech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anism, which was parted from the boiler</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a turn of a key; and the screw at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached to the false stern-post. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">these had been successively carried away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inside of the vessel was left free.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides the space reserved for the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chinery and the stores, it was divided</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a fore-cabin for the use of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew, and an aft-cabin occupied by Colo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">118</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nel Everest and his companions. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twinkling of an eye the partitions van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished, all the chests and bedsteads were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted out and now the vessel was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced to a mere shell thirty feet long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and composed of three parts, like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ma-Robert, the steam vessel used by Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Livingstone in his first voyage up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zambesi. It was made of galvanized</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel, so that it was light and at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time resisting. The bolts, which fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plates over a framework of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal, kept them firm, and also pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented the possibility of a leakage. Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liam Emery was truly astounded at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">simplicity of the work and the rapidity</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which it was executed. The. wagon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the guidance of Mokoum and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two Bochjesmen, had only arrived an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour when they were ready to load it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wagon, rather a primitive vehicle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mounted on four massive wheels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each pair being about twenty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart; it was a regular American "car"</seg><seg type="columnLine">in length. This clumsy machine, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its creaking axles projecting a good foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the wheels, was drawn by six</seg><seg type="columnLine">tame buffaloes, two and two, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were extremely sensitive to the long goad</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried by their driver. It required</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing less than such beasts as these</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move the vehicle when heavily laden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for in spite of the adroitness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"leader," it stuck in the mire more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. The crew of the Queen and Czar</seg><seg type="columnLine">now proceeded to load the wagon so as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to balance it well everywhere. The dex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terity of sailors is proverbial, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lading of the vehicle was like play to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brave men. They laid the larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces of the boat on the strongest part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wagon, immediately over the axles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wheels, so that the cases, chests,</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrels, and the lighter and more fragile</seg><seg type="columnLine">packages easily found room between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. As to the travelers themselves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a four-mile walk was nothing to them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By three o'clock the loading was finished,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and Colonel Everest gave the signal</seg><seg type="columnLine">for starting. He and his companions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with William Emery as guide, took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead, while the bushmen, the crew and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drivers of the wagon followed more</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. They performed the journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">without fatigue, for the slopes that led</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the upper course of the Orange made</seg><seg type="columnLine">their road easy, by making it longer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this was a happy thing for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily laden wagon, as it would thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the goal more surely, if more</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The different members of the commis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, clambered lightly up the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill, and the conversation became gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral. but there was still no mention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the object of the expedition. The Euro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peans were admiring the splendid scenes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were opened to their view, for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">grand nature so beautiful in its wildness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">charmed them as it had charmed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young astronomer, and their voyage had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet surfeited them with the natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauties of this African region, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they observed everything with a quiet ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miration, and. English-like, would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">do anything that might seem "improper."</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, the cataract drew forth some</seg><seg type="columnLine">graceful applause, and, although they</seg><seg type="columnLine">clapped perhaps with only the tips of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fingers, yet it was enough to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">that "nil admirari" was not quite their</seg><seg type="columnLine">motto. Besides, William Emery thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it his duty to do the honors of South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Africa to his guests; for he was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, and like certain over-enthusiastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizens, he did not spare a detail of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his African park. Towards half-past</seg><seg type="columnLine">four they had passed the cataract of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morgheda, and being now on level</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, the upper part of the river-lav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">before them as far as their eye could</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach, and they encamped on the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">to await the arrival of the wagon. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared at the top of the hill about five</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock, having accomplished the journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">in safety, and Colonel Everest ordered it</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEASURING A MERIDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">119</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to be unloaded immediately, announcing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were to start at daybreak the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next morning. All the night was passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in different occupations. The hull of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vessel was put together again in</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than an hour: then the boiler and</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery were put into place; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal partitions were fixed between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabins; the store-rooms were refur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nished, and the different packages neatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged on board, and everything done</seg><seg type="columnLine">so quickly that it told a great deal in</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor of the crew of the Queen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Czar. These Englishmen and Russians</seg><seg type="columnLine">were picked men, clever and well disci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plined, and thoroughly to be depended</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. The next day, the 1st of Febru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ary, the boat was ready to receive its</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers at daybreak. Already there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a volume of black smoke pouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the funnel, and the engineer, to'</seg><seg type="columnLine">put the machinery in motion, was caus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing jets of white steam to fly across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke. The machine being high pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, without a condenser, the steam</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped at every stroke of the piston,</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to the system applied to loco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">motives, and as to the boiler, with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingeniously contrived tubes, presenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large surface to the furnace, it only</seg><seg type="columnLine">required half an hour to furnish a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient quantity of steam. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid in a good stock of ebony and guia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cum, which were plentiful in the neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">borhood, and they were now feeding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great fire with this valuable wood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At six o'clock Colonel Everest gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the signal for starting, and the passen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers and crew went on board the Queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Czar. The hunter, who was ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quainted with the course of the river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed, leaving two Eochjcsmcn to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the wagon back to Lattakoo. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the vessel was slipping its cable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel Everest turned to the astron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">omer, and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By-the-bye, Mr. Emery, you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">why we have come here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have not the least idea, Colonel."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is very simple, Mr. Emery; we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have come to measure an arc of meridian</seg><seg type="columnLine">in South Africa."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Meter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE idea of an invariable and</seg><seg type="columnLine">constant system of measurement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which nature herself should</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnish the exact value, may be said</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have existed in the mind of man</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the earliest ages. It was of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highest importance, however, that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">measurement should be accurately de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined, whatever had been the cata-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clysms of which our earth had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene, and it is certain that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancients felt the same, though they</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed in methods and appliances for</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying out the work with sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">accuracy. The best way of obtaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">a constant measurement was to connect</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with the terrestrial sphere, whose cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumference must be considered as invari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, and then to measure the whole or</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of that circumference mathematic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally.

It must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be confessed that Sir John Murray's</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions were less excited than him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self at these magnificent specimens of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> William Emery was watching his col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leagues attentively, and trying to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover their character, under their cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">exterior.

That</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">any intimacy should ever be established</seg><seg type="columnLine">between two such important personages</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a thing not to be hoped for; two ice-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bergs, placed side by side, would join in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, but two scientific men, each holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">a high position, never.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nicholas Palander, a man of about</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty-five years of age, was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who have never been young and</seg><seg type="columnLine">who will never be old.

About</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty leagues above the falls the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">bends from its general direction, 'which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is east and west, and flows southeast</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as the acute angle which the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ritory of Cape Colony makes in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north, and then turning to the north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">east, it loses itself in the wooded coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try of the Transvaal Republic. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">early in the morning of the 5th of Feb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruary, in a driving rain, that the Queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Czar arrived at Klaarwater, a Hot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentot village, close to the meeting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Orange and Kuruman. Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everest, unwilling to lose a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed quickly by the few Boschjcsman</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabins that form the village, and under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pressure of her screw, the vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to ascend the affluent. The rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">current was to be attributed, as the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers remarked, to a peculiarity in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, for the Kuruman being wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">at its source, was lessened as it de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended, by the influence of the sun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays; but at this season, swollen by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rains, and further increased by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters of a sub-affluent, the Moschona,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it became very deep and rapid. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires were therefore made up, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel ascended the Kuruman at the rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of three miles an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the voyage the bushman point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed out a good many hippopotami in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water; but these great pachyderms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumsy, thickset beasts, from eight to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ten feet long, which the Dutch at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cape call "sea-cows," were by no means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an aggressive nature, and the hissing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the steam and the beating of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrcw quite frightened them, the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearing to them like some great</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster which they ought to distrust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in fact, the arsenal on board would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have rendered approach very difficult.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir John Murray would have very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked to try his explosive bullet on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleshy masses, but the bushman assured</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that there would be no lack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hippopotami in the more northerly rivers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he determined to wait for a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorable opportunity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The 150 miles which separated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth of the Kuruman from the station</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Lattakoo were traversed in fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours, and on the 7th of February the</seg><seg type="columnLine">travelers had readied the end of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey.

Mr. Dale read it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">much pleasure, and returned it to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel, saying that he might find it</seg><seg type="columnLine">useful on his journey, as the name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">David Livingstone was known and hon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ored throughout that part of Africa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The members of the Commission were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lodged in the missionary establishment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large house built on an eminence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded by an impenetrable hedge</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a fortification.

He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in a cloak of skins, sewn to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether with considerable art, anad an</seg><seg type="columnLine">apron called a "pujoke."

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">former times, before the arrival of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">missionaries, these Bochjesmen were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying, inhospitable race, thinking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but murder and pillage, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking advantage of an enemy's sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">to massacre him. To a great extent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the missionaries have modified these</seg><seg type="columnLine">barbarous habits, but the natives are still</seg><seg type="columnLine">more or less farm-pillagers and cattle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten wagons, like the vehicle which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mokoum had taken to the Morgheda</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falls, formed the bulk of the expedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.

The provisions of the Bochjes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men consisted principally of antelope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">buffalo or elephant meat, preserved in</seg><seg type="columnLine">long strips, being dried in the sun or</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a slow fire; thus economizing the use</seg><seg type="columnLine">of salt, here very scarce. In the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bread, the Bochjesmen depended on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth-nuts of the arachis, the bulbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of various species of mesembryanthe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mums, and other native productions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Animal food would be provided by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hunters of the party, who, adroitly</seg><seg type="columnLine">employing their bows and lances, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">scour the plains and revictual the car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">avan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Six native oxen, long-legged, high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldered, and with great horns, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached to each wagon with harness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of buffalo hide.

Among the troops of quadrupeds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were also half a dozen tame quaggas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a kind of ass with plump bodies and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender legs, who make a noise like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barking of a dog.

Some dogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a half savage breed, sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrongly called "hyena-hunters," ran by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side of the wagons, their shape and</seg><seg type="columnLine">long ears reminding one of the Euro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pean brach-hound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such was the caravan which was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bury itself in the deserts.

The Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained to the bushman what he want-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, and with the calmness of one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom scientific language is familiar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked to him of triangles, adjacent</seg><seg type="columnLine">angles, hases. meridians, zenith distances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the like.

You are asking for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large, level plain; oh, well, I can find you</seg><seg type="columnLine">that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And at his orders, the caravan, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">just ascended the Lattakoo hills, turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">down again towards the southwest.. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">took them rather more to the south of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the village towards the plain watered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kuruman, and here the bushman ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected to find a suitable place for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel's plans. From that day, he al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways took the head of the caravan. Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Murray, well mounted, never left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and from time to time the report</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a gun made his colleagues aware that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was making acquaintance with the Af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rican game. The Colonel, quite absorbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in contemplating the difficulties of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition, let his horse carry him on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Matthew Strux, sometimes on horseback,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes in the wagon, according to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature of the ground, seldom opened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips. Nicholas Palander, as bad a rider</seg><seg type="columnLine">as could be, was generally on foot; at</seg><seg type="columnLine">other times he shut himself up in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicle, and there lost himself in the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foundest mathematical abstractions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although William Emery and Michael</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zorn occupied separate wagons at night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were always together when the car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">avan was on the march. Every day and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every incident of the journey bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in a closer friendship. From one</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage to another they rode, talked, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">argued together. Sometimes they fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the train, and sometimes rode on</seg><seg type="columnLine">several miles ahead of it, when the plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended as far as they could see. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were free here and lost amidst the wild-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of nature. How they forgot figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">and problems, calculations and observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, and chatted of everything but</seg><seg type="columnLine">science! They were no longer astron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">omers contemplating the starry firma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, but were more like two youths</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped from school, reveling in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense forests and boundless plains. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">128</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed like ordinary mortals. Both of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them had excellent dispositions, open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amiable, and devoted, forming a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrast to Colonel Everest and Matthew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strux, who were formal, not to say stiff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These two chiefs were often the subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their conversations, and Emery learnt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good deal about them from his friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Michael Zorn, that day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I watched them well on board the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Augusta, and I profess to think they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">jealous of each other.

At midday on the 4th of March,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it reached the base of the long wooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills which extend from Lattakoo. Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">koum was not mistaken; he had led the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition toward the plain, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still undulated, and therefore unfitted for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an attempt at triangulation. The march</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued uninterrupted, and Mokoum</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode at the head of the riders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagons, while Sir John Murray, Emery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Zorn pushed on in advance. Toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the day, they all arrived at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">station occupied by one of the wander-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing "boers," or farmers, who are in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced by the richness of the pasture-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land to make temporary abodes in vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous parts of the country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The colonist, a Dutchman, and head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a large family, received the Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his companions most hospitably, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take no remuneration in return.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was one of those brave, industrious</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, whose slender capital, intelligently</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed in the breeding of oxen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cows, and goats, soon produces a for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune. When the pasturage is exhausted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the farmer, like a patriarch of old, seeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">for new springs and fertile prairies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitching his camp afresh where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions seem favorable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The farmer opportunely told Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everest of a wide plain, fifteen miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, which would be found quite flat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The caravan started early next morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">at daybreak. The only incident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke the monotory of the long morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing march, was Sir John Murray's tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a shot at a distance of more than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1,000	yards, at a gnu, a curious animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">about five feet high, with the muzzle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ox, a long white tail, and pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">horns. It fell with a heavy groan, much</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the astonishment of the bushman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was surprised at seeing the animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck at such a distance. The gnu gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erally affords a considerable quantity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellent meat, and was accordingly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">high esteem among the hunters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">caravan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The site indicated by the farmer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached about mid-day.

No better</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot for measuing a base could be im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agined, and the bushman, after a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigation, returned to Colonel Ev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erest with the announcement that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reached the place they were seeking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Base of the Triangle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE work undertaken by the Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission was a triangulation for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purpose of measuring an arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">of meridian. Now the direct measure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of one or more degrees by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of metal rods would be impracticable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In no part of the world is there a region</seg><seg type="columnLine">so vast and unbroken as to admit of so</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicate an operation. Happily, there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">an easier way of proceeding by divid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the region through which the merid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ian passes into a number of imaginary</seg><seg type="columnLine">triangles, whose solution is comparatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These triangles are obtained by ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serving signals, either natural or arti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficial, such as church-towers, posts, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">rcverbcratory lamps, by means of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">theodolite or repeating-circle. Every sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nal is the vertex of a triangle, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">angles are exactly determined by the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struments, so that a good observer with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper telescope can take the bearings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">130</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">any object whatever, a tower by day, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lamp by night. Sometimes the sides of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the triangles are many miles in length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when Arago connected the coast of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valencia in Spain with the Baleric</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islands, one of the sides measured 422,-</seg><seg type="columnLine">555 toises. When one §ide and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">angles of any triangle are known, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other sides and angle may be found;</seg><seg type="columnLine">by taking, therefore, a side of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the known triangles for a new base, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">by measuring the angles adjacent to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the base, new triangles can be success-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully formed along the whole length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arc; and since every straight line</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the network of triangles is known, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of the arc can be easily deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined. The values of the sides and</seg><seg type="columnLine">angles may be obtained by the theodolite</seg><seg type="columnLine">and repeating 'jjde, but the first side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the base of the whole system, must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually measured on the ground, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this operation requires the utmost care.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Delambre and Mechain meas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ured the meridian of France from Dun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kirk to Barcelona, they took for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">base a straight line, 12,150 meters in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, in the road from Melun to Lieu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">saint, and they were no less than 42 days</seg><seg type="columnLine">in measuring it. Colonel Everest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Matthew Strux designed proceeding in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same way, and it will be seen how</seg><seg type="columnLine">much precision was necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The work was begun on the 5th of</seg><seg type="columnLine">March, much to the astonishment of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bochjesmen, who could not at all un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand it. Mokoum thought it strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">for these learned men to measure the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth with rods six feet long; and any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, he had done his duty; they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked him for a level plain and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it for them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The place was certainly well chosen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Covered with dry, short grass, the plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">was perfectly level as far as the horizon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind lay a line of hills forming the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southern boundary of the Kalahari</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert; toward the north the plain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed boundless. To the east, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides of the table-land of Lattakoo dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared in gentle slopes; and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west, where the ground was lower, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil became marshy, as it imbibed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stagnant water which fed the affluents</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Kuruman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think, Colonel Everest," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strux, after he had surveyed the grassy</seg><seg type="columnLine">level, "that when our base is estab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lished, we shall be able here also to fix</seg><seg type="columnLine">the extremity of our meridian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Likely enough," replied the Colonel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We must find out too, whether the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc meets with any obstacles that may</seg><seg type="columnLine">impede the survey.

It would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long operation, for they wanted to ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain even more correct results than those</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained by the French philosophers at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Melun. This would be a matter of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty; since when a new base was</seg><seg type="columnLine">measured afterward near Pepignan to</seg><seg type="columnLine">verify the calculations, there was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">an error of 11 inches in a distance of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">33,000	toises (70,339# feet). Tj</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Orders were given for encamping, anj</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Bochjesman village, a kind of kraal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was formed on the plain.

For</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than eight miles (the proposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of the base) was the measurement</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued, and the young men performed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their work with scrupulous fidelity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next step was to adjust the rods</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the actual measurement, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very simple operation, but which, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, demands the most continuous cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, as the success of a triangulation in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great measure is contingent on its pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciseness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the morning of the 10th. twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden pedestals were planted along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, securely fastened in their position,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and prepared to support the rods. Col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onel Everest and Matthew Strux, as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted by their young coadjutors, placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their rods in position, and Nicholas Pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ander, stood ready, pencil in hand, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">write down in a double register the fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures transmitted to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rods employed were six in num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber, and exactly two toises in length.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were made of platinum, as being</seg><seg type="columnLine">(under ordinary circumstances) unaf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fected by any condition of the atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere. In order, however, to provide</seg><seg type="columnLine">against any change of temperature, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">was covered with a rod of copper some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">what shorter than itself, and a micro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scopic vernier was attached, to indicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">any contraction or expansion that might</seg><seg type="columnLine">occur. The rods were next placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengthwise, with a small interval between</seg><seg type="columnLine">each, in order to avoid the slight shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">which might result from immediate con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact. Colonel Everest and Matthew Strux</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their own hands placed the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">rod. About a hundred toises farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, they had marked a point of sight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as the rods were each provided with</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron projections, it was not difficult to</seg><seg type="columnLine">place them exactly in the proper direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.

The results</seg><seg type="columnLine">were inscribed in two registers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed by the members of the Commis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were still two further observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, no less important, to be made: the</seg><seg type="columnLine">variation of the rod caused by differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ences of temperature, and the exact dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance measured by it. The former was</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily determined by comparing the dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference in length between the platinum</seg><seg type="columnLine">and copper rods. The microscope gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the variation of the platinum, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was entered in the double register, to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward reduced to 16° Centigrade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had now to observe the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually measured. To obtain this re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sult, it was necessary to place the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond rod at the end of the first, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small space between them. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second rod was adjusted with the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">care as the former, it only remained to</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure the interval between the two.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A small plate of platinum, known as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slider, was attached to the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platinum bar that was not covered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the copper, and this Colonel Everest</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped gently along until it touched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next rod. The slider was marked off</seg><seg type="columnLine">into 10,000ths of a toise, and as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vernier with its microscope gave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">100,000ths, the space could be very ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curately determined. The result was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately registered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Michael Zorn, considering that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered platinum might be sooner af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fected by heat than the uncovered cop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per. suggested another precaution; ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cordingly they erected a small awning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to protect the rod from the sun's rays.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For more than a month were these</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutiae patiently carried on. As soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as four bars were adjusted, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">requisite observations complete, the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rods was carried to the front.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was impossible to measure more than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">220 to 230 toises a day, and sometimes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when wind was violent, operations were</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether suspended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every evening, about three-quarters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an hour before it became too dark to</seg><seg type="columnLine">read the verniers, they left off work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after taking various anxious precautions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They brought forward temporarily the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rod "No. 1," and marked the point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its termination. Here they made a hole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drove in a stake with a leaden plate</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached. They then replaced "No.</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its original position, after observing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inclination, the thermometric varia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and the direction. They noted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prolongation measured by rod "No. 4."</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, with a plumb-line touching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foremost end of rod "No. 1," they made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mark on the leaden plate. They care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully traced through this point two lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">at right angles, one signifying the base,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other the perpendicular. The plate</seg><seg type="columnLine">was then covered with a wooden lid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hole filled in, and the stake left</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried till the morning. Thus, if any</seg><seg type="columnLine">accident had occurred to their apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the night they would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">obliged to begin afresh.

Col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onel Everest proposed 6,000 toises,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly the same as the base measured at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Melun; but Matthew Strux wished that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it should be 10,000 toises, since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground permitted.

The elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tron is really a particle of negative electricity</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than an electrified particle, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proton a particle of positive electricity.

According</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my theory, that part of the cosmic world</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we might call the ether, for want of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">better word, is an intensively charged magnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">field. How is it charged? That is another</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown quantity, but for our purpose let us</seg><seg type="columnLine">assume that this is the case.
