A</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant in size, he was bandaged in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half dozen places; his gray eyebrows</seg><seg type="columnLine">were twisted upward, like a devil's</seg><seg type="columnLine">horns; and lie had an air about him of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man who could rip an oak tree up by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roots.

His gray eyes had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrewd and keen in their first appraisal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 11s; they were eyes that seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take in everything at a glance and bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight through you. Yet when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled, when the crow's feet at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edges were accentuated and his firm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white teeth were disclosed, I warmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him immediately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah!" lie exclaimed, holding out his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">3</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FRONTIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">reat right hand, with the cup in it, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be cabin-boy for another draught.</seg><seg type="columnLine">'That's fine, by the Flying Dutchman!</seg><seg type="columnLine">\nd many thanks to you, sir," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">idded to Captain Van Tassel, lifting</seg><seg type="columnLine">he refilled cup by way of salute. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ifter taking another drink, he contin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ued. "And I hopes you don't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">he same luck.

And here I am."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So?" was the skipper's only com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">:nent. He puffed at his long-stemmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">&gt;ipe, eyeing Donovan stolidly through</seg><seg type="columnLine">he curling wreaths of smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," Donovan returned. "Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">far out of Salem, too--and they killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill but three of fourteen hands I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">iboard. Them three they set adrift</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me, but they died o' wounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They took my old Cormoran--fore</seg><seg type="columnLine">nd aft rigged, same as this here craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and what they'll do wLh her I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">now.

But I, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing afire with excitement, pressed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for further details. Donovan, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, seemed loth to discuss the piracy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beyond saying that the pirate ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore the freshly painted name Nancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Simmons and was a square-rigger with</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve guns, he added little more to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brief account.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had sailed out of Halifax, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, and had but two guns aboard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His rudder had been shot away at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first fire; and at least thirty men had</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarded him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that," he said, "was about all</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was to it, my son." He shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head gloomily, adding, "If it's just</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same to you, son, I'd rather talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">about wirlimigigs, or a tot o' rum, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyin' fishes--anything at all, least-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways, 'cept losin' all I had. So here's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud in your eye, and a fair wind!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But though he fought shy of dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussing those details of the fight for</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I thirsted, like any youth, Roar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Bill Donovan soon proved to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerful and entertaining companion</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard ship. Sometimes he was mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose and brooding; sometimes he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to want to be alone; but after</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cutlas wounds began to heal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been given a berth aft, was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shaved and rested, he was, for the'</seg><seg type="columnLine">most part, the sunniest man aboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could imitate a dozen and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds and animals; he was an excellent</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinner of thrilling yarns, woven</seg><seg type="columnLine">about adventures he had experienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all parts of the globe; and scarce a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day passed in which he failed to trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port me on the wings of his fancy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tortugas, or the African gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast, or to isles where, he swore, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands were thick with the bones of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pirates who had died fighting over</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried treasure. Furthermore, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a melodious voice, and it was a treat</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see him striding back and forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the poop, stepping as lightly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a youth for all his years and tremend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous size, roaring out a -chanty which</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh quarter, oh quarter!" cried the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   jolly pirate then;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blow high, blow low, and what care</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   we?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the quarter that we gave them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> was to sink them in the sea,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sailing down the coast o' the High</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barbaree!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man after my own heart," our</seg><seg type="columnLine">young first mate, Jenkins, said one day</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Donovan had been aboard a mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of three weeks. "I hope Mr. Bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lew has a billet for him when we get</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Savannah."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The skipper removed his pipe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blew a mouthful of fragrant smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air. He. too, was a large man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though not so tall as Donovan. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, in fact, to be overly fat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">phlegmatic, and even stupid at times.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet many a man had been fooled, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sorrow, by that mild blue eye, those</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaccid jowls, that shuffling, rolling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spraddling gait, and his habit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamily puffing his pipe, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">half asleep. Underneath those layers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fat were muscles of steel; and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derneath that sleepy mien was a mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">that functioned like a keen rapier go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing straight to the point. I had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">him leap across the deck like a cata-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mount and knock the heads of three</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutinous seamen together with little</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent effort. Now he eyed Dono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">van and pursed his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He iss a goot navigator--none pet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter," he said. "Dot much I know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Und so I shall rebort."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so matters were standing when,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having been blown from our course by</seg><seg type="columnLine">adverse winds, we sighted a low-lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-master displaying signals of dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Chapter II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A BATTERED SHIP .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UMMPH!" grunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Van Tas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sel, lifting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass. "Vot now?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donovan and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">were standing be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side him on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poop, and we fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed his example, studying the stran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger through long brass telescopes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun was shining very brightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that morning, and the long vessel--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship of six hundred tons burden--was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly outlined on the waters. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying British colors and bore the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">Retriever. A square-rigged ship, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sails had been taken in, save for a reef</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two, and I saw at a glance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">something was wrong with her steer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing gear; for she was broadside on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind and wallowing lazily in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">troughs of the long, easy swells. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a list to starboard, and was lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">so low that her scuppers dipped now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again; and, as we came closer, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear the steady clank-dank of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pumps working in her hold. In addi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to this her bowsprit had gone by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the board, and there were several gap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing holes in her bulwarks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Roundshot," Donovan grunted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was more and more obvious as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we drew nearer. She had been badly</seg><seg type="columnLine">worsted in one of those grim sea bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tles which were but incidental in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">belligerent and unsettled period. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot had passed through the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">fo'c'sle; another had smashed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of the cabin; and her gigs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in splinters. Only a half dozen men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in sight on her decks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what struck me most forcibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">was this: though she was a merchant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man by design, I counted as many as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen guns aboard her. These, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exception of two, which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismounted, were jacketed; but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">judged them to be nine and twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A privateer or a pirate!" I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed excitedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Roaring Bill lowered his glass and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at me in a sidelong fashion</seg><seg type="columnLine">without turning his head. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were twinkling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not much difference, 'cept that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">has a letter and the other hasn't," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed, dryly. Then he turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skipper. "By your leave, sir," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "but was you intendin' to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">them swabs aboard?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His maimer in addressing the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain was deferential--a habit he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DEVIL'S CALDRON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">maintained ever since coming aboard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In my opinion he was, in truth, a shade</seg><seg type="columnLine">the better navigator of the two; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been times when I sensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was fairly itching to crowd on</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas when the skipper was taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sail. But he never put forward an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion in opposition to Van Tassel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">views. From the very first he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken his trick as a sort of extra mate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever being ready with a cheery, "Ay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ay, sir!" when the skipper gave an</seg><seg type="columnLine">order. So now Captain Van Tassel</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered his own telescope and an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered pleasantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Veil, sir," he said, "I subbose I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to. But I don't choost like it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the looks from her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And right you were, sir!" Roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill exclaimed, nodding emphatically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I was going to say I had heard some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">'at about that craft. I can't rightly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member what, nor where--but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't good, and, anyway, you're right</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to like the looks of any Britisher</seg><seg type="columnLine">these days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Van Tassel nodded on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own account; but, he pointed out, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon humanity bade him to give the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Retriever's crew the benefit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt. If they were pirates and look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for another ship, it was patent that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were in no position to fire upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Anthony Wayne, since their ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unmanageable and plainly sink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for being boarded at the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute, the skipper said that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take steps to forestall this. Forthwith</seg><seg type="columnLine">all hands were piped on deck. Pistols</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cutlases were handed out; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jackets were removed from our long</seg><seg type="columnLine">nines, which were four in number;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the brass guns were then loaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with double shot and slugs. Not until</seg><seg type="columnLine">then did Van Tassel give orders to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear down 011 the Retriever; where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Donovan entered the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Veil," the captain shouted, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were hove-to close to the sinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel, "vot do you vant?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Retriever's skipper, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing on his quarter deck, eyed our</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain for a moment with open</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. He was a tall, spare man, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide, bony shoulders, a flat, sallow</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, and long, drooping yellow mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tachios. Around his head he wore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-stained blue scarf, while two</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy silver-mounted pistols were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust into a yellow silk sash which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had bound round his waist. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far from prepossessing in appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance; nor were the half dozen men</seg><seg type="columnLine">near him of pleasing aspect. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a brandy-faced lot of muscular,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Weather-beaten old tars: some with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their whiskers curled in tight little</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringlets; some with brass rings hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from their ear lobes; and all bear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a scar or two and giving the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression that their calloused hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fully as used to the "heft" of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutlas as the feel of a rope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Veil," Captain Van Tassel re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated, "I say it again: vot do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">vant ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Want?" cried the Retriever's skip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per then. "Why, what but to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard? You've an eye in your head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I reckon; this craft is slated for Davy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones' locker, and that before sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. Met up with a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchies, and they shot me full o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Vot I meant vas diss," Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Van Tassel went on imperturbably.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You have it a l&gt;oat left, maybe?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All stove in," was the reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Veil, den, how many vas you ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the answer the Retriever's cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain stepped to a hatchway and said</seg><seg type="columnLine">something which we could not hear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a trice the sound of the pumps</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased, and four men came tumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There you sees 'em,'' said he with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yellow sash. "Eleven, with me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he looked us over, and smiled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To their eleven, all apparently un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed, save the captain, we presented</seg><seg type="columnLine">a front numbering seventeen men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed to the teeth. "Saw you load-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them guns," the stranger went on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, now, if you're on that lay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's plenty cargo yet that ain't hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">by water--enough, anyway, to pay you</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the trouble of layin' alongside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As for us--why, we haven't much</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice, we ain't. All we asks is quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, and a foot ashore, any place. Us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and four wounded."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ve ain't birates," grunted Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Can Tassel.

And he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders to lay alongside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While this maneuver was being ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecuted I stepped down from the poop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It appeared that my chances for en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaging in a sea fight were gone glim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mering, and I found myself torn be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween relief and a sense of disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointment. Then, while I was pacing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">about and gripping my cutlas nerv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously, I looked into the cabin and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roaring Bill Donovan coming up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lazarette. In his hands he carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">a keg of powder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly curious, I ran into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin. Donovan had placed the keg</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the deck, and was busy with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brace and bit boring a small hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What are you going to do?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch," he said. Removing a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fuse from his pocket, he inserted it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hole, leaving a bare inch pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truding. This he secured with a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wax snatched from a candleholder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Next he produced a bit of tarry rope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he ignited with flint and tin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," he said, blowing on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing coal at the end of his im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">provised torch, "I don't know as I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">'ve dealt with them swabs same as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper's doing. But nemmind that;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's skipper, and a good one. Just the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same, I don't trust them swabs, and.</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Flying Dutchman, if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes a crooked move, you'll see</seg><seg type="columnLine">something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But aren't you apt to blow your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self and the lot of us up before you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can get that away?" I cried, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">askance at that short fuse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Donovan looked at me once more in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sidelong fashion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Son. don't you go to frettin' about</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Bill," he said, dryly. "I knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I'm about."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a second I considered speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the captain, but in the next breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought better of it. For one thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's very assurance inspired con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidence; for another, I, too, was skep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical about the actual number of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">still aboard the Retriever. We had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no opportunity of looking into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hold. So as Donovan stepped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin door and halted there, wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, I went out on deck and paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then everything seemed to happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the space of a few heartbeats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">E HAD barely come</seg><seg type="columnLine">alongside the Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">triever when her</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain raised a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle to his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blew a sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast. The men on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his deck stooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly and came up with cutlases and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistols which they had hidden at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, close against the bulwarks. Mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time a swarm of men came roaring out</seg><seg type="columnLine">6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FRONTIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the after cabin, the fo'c'sle, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open hatchway. They were armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with cutlases, and they made for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulwarks with a yell that fairly split</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eardrums.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Out the swabs--all hands, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands!" roared their skipper, leaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bulwarks and firing both pistols</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the knot of men at our after port</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In that horrible moment our fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed certain. In reality there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty men pouring out to attack us;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at first glance there seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred. And though Captain Van</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tassel fired on the instant, and others</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed suit, dropping a man here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there, the most of our crew were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown into a panic. I, for one, yelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitedly and fired my pistol with only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hasty aim; in the next second I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found myself facing a burly ruffian</seg><seg type="columnLine">who came charging at me with his cut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">las swinging high above his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even before his blade fell Dono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">van had acted, and the tide was turned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the tail of my eye I saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamp the glowing end of the tarry</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope to the fuse. It sputtered. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">an upward sweep of his arms he raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy keg over his head; then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a mighty heave, the giant threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">his terrible bomb toward the Retriev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er's deck. It struck the pirates' leader</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly in the breast as he balanced upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bulwarks. He was knocked back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward to his own deck, the keg of pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der tumbling with him; and immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately afterward there followed a tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous explosion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was knocked to the deck by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of it. The man who aimed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut me down pitched over me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though shot from a gun, sprawling on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face in the scuppers. A dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, including our own men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who had gained our deck, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked into a cocked hat, as the say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing goes, sprawling here and there in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every imaginable attitude, while others</seg><seg type="columnLine">were brought up standing, with silly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shocked expressions on their faces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On our deck the majority had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">protected from serious wounds by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervening bulwarks of the two ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sels, but the execution on the deck of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Retriever was frightful. Fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">two-thirds of their men had yet to gain</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bulwarks when the spark struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the powder in that keg. Others were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still poised at the rail, ready to leap</seg><seg type="columnLine">across to our planks. Of these, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">were blown across our decks and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea; some were knocked down, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious, into the midst of our men;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and others were killed by flying splin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ters. But those remaining on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own deck suffered most terribly. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were blown in every direction, three</seg><seg type="columnLine">being lifted to the yardarms, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they hung, dangling, and one being</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown, tumbling end over end, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">land in the sea astern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Donovan had thrown himself prone</seg><seg type="columnLine">after casting the bomb. Now we</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled up together. Snatching up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cutlas from a fallen men, he glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the poop, saw that Captain Van</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tassel was down--shot through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lie thrust it quickly into his shirt bosom</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">calf of his right leg, as we learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">later--and then rallied our men with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stentorian roar. Before the smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the explosion had drifted away we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were following him about the deck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting down those who had gained a</seg><seg type="columnLine">footing among us. Some fought des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perately; some cried for quarter; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">others attempted to jump back aboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own vessel. We in the meantime,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under Donovan's leadership, kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">some degree of organization, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">isolated men were quickly borne down</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a concerted rush and our deck was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly cleared. Then, pausing a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment for breath, the giant brought us</seg><seg type="columnLine">round him again with another roar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A round dozen of us yet ?" he cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">''Well, then, by the Flying Dutchman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll do the boarding now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaped to the bulwarks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed his bloody cutlas at the decks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Relriver, still enveloped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifting whisps of smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At 'em, my hearties!" he bellowed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Follow me, all hands!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were over and into them on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant, aflame with the joy of victory</seg><seg type="columnLine">on our own deck and eager to be at</seg><seg type="columnLine">them before they could recover fully</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shock of that explosion. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were confronted by fairly equal num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers; but some of these were still</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazed and went down at the first on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaught. Thereupon the crews split</seg><seg type="columnLine">into entangled groups which milled</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there about the deck, step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping over screaming wounded men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hacking at one another in a bedlam of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries and curses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For my own part, I was close be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind Donovan when he struck the Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">triever's deck. A pirate lunged at me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, in dodging his cut, I almost fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a gaping hole in the planks. Don-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ovan split the man to the chin with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistling stroke and went on. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother pirate came at me, and I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself battling desperately to save my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How long we cut and slashed at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other I do not know. To me it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a century. The man fought with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury of despair, and he cut at me so</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly that I had hard shift to ward</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the blows. He had a brutish, pock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked face, and a patch over one eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I saw later in my dreams. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">when my lungs seemed to be bursting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the perspiration was pouring into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes, he stumbled, and my blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">found his neck. He went down with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked sob.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The force of my blow had almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung me from my feet, so that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled over him and leaned, panting</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily, against the cabin companion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Thus my attention was called</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a scuffle in the pirate captain's quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters. Turning, I saw Donovan, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back toward me. He had just cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">down one of the buccaneers and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the act of jerking something from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fallen man's hand. What it was I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not see, for he thrust it quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his shirt bosom before turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterward I remembered that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">started a little, then quickly recovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. At the time I gave it little</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. He came rushing out at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">and paused abruptly to scan the shat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, bloody deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got your man, I see!" he panted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bully for you, Jack!" And he clap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped me heartily on the shoulder with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his left hand. "Well, our two was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last," he went on, pointing with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutlas. "See there, Jack? They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">done."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked, and saw that he spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth. Only a bare half dozen pirates</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained untouched, and these had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown down their arms and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">begging for qrarter. The fight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DEVIL S CALDRON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Chapter III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JERRY BLUNT's DOUBLOONS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">S I looked about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-smeared deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reaction set in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The planks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">strewn with dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wounded. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead lay in grotes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">que, distorted atti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tudes ; some with the teeth showing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghastly grins through pallid lips; some</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their pale, stiff fingers hooked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">talon-wise, as though reaching out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last desperate hold on life. Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors from the Anthony Wayne had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been killed outright; five more had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been wounded; and the Retriever's</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead numbered fourteen, including the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain and the mate. Of the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mainder, four had received mortal</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounds, and only six had escaped un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt. When I noted the unwholesome</seg><seg type="columnLine">pallor of the dead, and listened to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries and groans of the injured, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with pity and nausea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I was given little time to indulge</seg><seg type="columnLine">in morbid fancies. Despite his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded leg, Captain Van Tassel had</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn himself up beside the bulwarks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Standing on his uninjured leg, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripping the rail tightly, he snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out an order that brought our excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew to heel in a jiffy. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to do before the sinking pirate</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel was abandoned; and so young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Jenkins, our mate, was set busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once, putting prisoners below at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pumps, detailing others to remove their</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously injured comrades to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anthony Wayne, and setting our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew to stripping the Retriever of</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything transportable in the way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuables and gear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Und gif a close look aft for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong room, Mr. Jenkins," the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The poor skipper was very pale and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim as he stood there, fighting down</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pain. He was nursing bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts. He knew, and the men knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his blunder in going alongside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Retriever to facilitate the removal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">salvage had come within an ace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">costing the lives of all of us. Dono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">van, on the other hand, undoubtedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">had saved the day. As we paused a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment for a drink of brandy before</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunging into our search, he was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">receiver of many gruff words of heart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt praise from our sweating hands;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if he had been popular l&gt;efore, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was plain that he was almost an idol</seg><seg type="columnLine">now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ah, by gum!" one said, admiringly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to a shipmate, "that was the prime</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodge, and no mistake.

You had only to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick up the pieces."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To all this Donovan waved a de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">precating hand. Captain Van Tassel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">name had not been mentioned, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course; but Donovan knew very well</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the men were thinking. So, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he confessed to me later, not desiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to "fall foul of the skipper's hawse</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more than could be helped," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made as light of the incident as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Twas only as I has a natural tend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ency to be ready for such sculch," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, tossing off his brandy. "It's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to what others of the same kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">did to me, d'y'see. And now, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jenkins," he went on, briskly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerily, "what's the lay for me, sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young mate was hesitant for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second--for he, too, admired Donovan</seg><seg type="columnLine">immensely, and he was diffident about</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving orders to a master mariner so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many years his senior. Indeed, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">order was made in the form of a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quest; but Donovan, with the cheeri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est, "Ay, ay, sir!" hurried at once with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me into the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That swab," he said, indicating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead seaman on the floor, "was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate.

Thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was sure of him. minute I spotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Where did you know him ?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why," Donovan returned, easily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"met him in Boston once. I knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">this hooker now. If I ain't mistaken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she's the old Muscovy, renamed. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead skipper out there--him with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow sash--why, he's Brazil--Slim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brazil. You've heard of him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, yes," I cried. "He's been</seg><seg type="columnLine">posted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right you are," said Donovan, busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning out drawers. "I got a look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mug once in Boston, afore he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">l&gt;osted for the gallows. At that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, I wasn't sure of myself until</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	seen him blow his whistle and jump</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the bulwarks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was on the tip of my tongue then</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask him about the object which</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulged in his shirt front, but he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not seen fit to mention it to me, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was held back by two considerations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whatever it was, he had come upon it</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, and he had saved my life. So I</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept silence. Then, as a seaman came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in with an ax, we fell to upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked hatch over the strong room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the discovery we made there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">drove Donovan's find from my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the time lieing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In four brass-bound chests we</seg><seg type="columnLine">found an assortment of coins amount-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in all to over twenty thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The coins came from the mints of</seg><seg type="columnLine">many countries, with English guineas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">double guineas, pieces of eight, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">French Louis making up two-thirds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the total. With them were moidores,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces from the Orient bored through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle, sequins, piasters, crowns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gold, silver and copper coins bear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the bas-relief portraits of nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the European monarchs since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Middle Ages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In addition to this we found rubies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearls, diamonds, and emeralds which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with other precious stones, were val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ued at some four thousand pounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And from the hold we retrieved a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large number of salable articles. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">included lxiles of silk, rolls of brocade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxes of shoes, kegs of liquor, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred new fowling pieces, forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">clocks, a lot of pewter ware, seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">sets of handsome, silver-mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">dueling pistols, a box of polished silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">candle-sticks, as many as fifty powder</seg><seg type="columnLine">kegs, and a dozen and one other items.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Furthermore, we stripped the Retriev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er of all her rations, charts, sails,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocks and small arms before we left</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. The brass cannons were left on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her deck, these being too cumbersome</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sling aboard at the last. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the Retriever had settled to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous point, despite the pumps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we cleared away, leaving her to sink</seg><seg type="columnLine">in unison with the blazing sun on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">western horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE finding of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure w a s</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted with a yell</seg><seg type="columnLine">of delight by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew; for my uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, above all, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">just and generous</seg><seg type="columnLine">m an, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew they were due to share. It also</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessened the tension. Captain Van</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tassel, I knew, was promptly forgiven</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the men, while Donovan's popular-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity was increased the more. As fur</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skipper, lie became markedly less</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim, even smiling when Donovan</seg><seg type="columnLine">came aboard, and owning up to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fault handsomely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I dought I vas gareful," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But not quite enough.

That's to fix a bandage on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg of yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And securing the medical kit, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable giant, with his tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, shortly displayed a deftness in</seg><seg type="columnLine">surgery that might well have won the</seg><seg type="columnLine">praise of any surgeon. Nor did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop with the captain. Whistling cheer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, he labored far on into the night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">treating our men and the wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">buccaneers as well, extracting bullets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stitching up wounds with a skill</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was admirable to behold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What I says," exclaimed Mr. Jen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kins, "is this: there's as handy an all-</seg><seg type="columnLine">around man as I've seen afloat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime all the uninjured</seg><seg type="columnLine">buccaneers had been closely guarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clapped in irons the instant they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came on board. Most of them had</seg><seg type="columnLine">little to say; like their wounded, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pale, depressed, and, for the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">part, sullen and brooding. Occasion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally one tried to rally his fellows; one</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two attempted bravado, but the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jority responded to this with grins</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were all too feeble. A moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later they relapsed once more, sunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their contemplation of the fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">which awaited them. Now one licked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dry lips; now one shivered appre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hensively; for they had been taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-handed, and the shadow of the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pending gallows lay over them all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among them was a black-browed</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant, called Beef McCallum by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipmates. He had been quartermaster</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard the Retriever. A fearful cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the left side of his head had cost</seg><seg type="columnLine">him an ear and had also knocked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscious so that he lay, breathing</seg><seg type="columnLine">stertorously, for two days and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">without speaking. We thought at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the man's skull had been frac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured and that he would undoubtedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">die, but on the third day he rallied</seg><seg type="columnLine">and. within an hour or two, was sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Going about with Donovan on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounds--for he had continued to act</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the doctor--I came upon the man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated on a pallet on the fo'c'sle deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a tarpaulin, along with other</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded buccaneers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ha!" said Donovan. "So you don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheat the gallows after all, my hearty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The buccaneer winced a little and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scowled at us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's as may be," he growled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, with a look from the tail of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye at his comrades, he spoke bluntly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but with an appeal in his bloodshot</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes that belied his gruffness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Could I have a word with you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Glancing at Donovan I caught a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange flicker in his narrowed eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But almost at once he spoke up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No harm in that, I suppose," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">he. "Come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We gave the man a hand up, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment had helped him, tottering</seg><seg type="columnLine">with weakness, to a point amidships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of earshot of his comrades. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">we three paused, McCallum leaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the bulwarks for support. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no longer gruff, but stared at Don-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ovan beseechingly. Stark fear was</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring from his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I ain't no coward," he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarsely, "but the gallows--I'll say</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've the horrors for thought of 'em.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, now, what I want to ask is this:</seg><seg type="columnLine">if so be it I could tell you where Jerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blunt's cache lay, would I get off?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the geniality had flown from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donovan's features.

You must have found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chart."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Donovan looked round about quickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No one was within earshot'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Grant that I have," he said. "Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, you want your life.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of Jerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blunt was one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">conjure with at sea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had sailed as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">privateer during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the war; he had been posted for piracy</seg><seg type="columnLine">later; and he. was supposed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken no less than two hundred ships.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It required little stretching of the im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">agination to credit him with a cache</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that size; and it was plain that Don-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ovan believed the assertion, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew in a whistling breath, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes afire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And do you know where it's bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ied?" he exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McCallum changed countenance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes--and no," he said, ruefully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's on a island out over the rim, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the South Pacific--a place Jerry Blunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">named the Devil's Caldron. It's a main</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot for cannibals thereabouts, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">that island ain't inhabited, along of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sperrits or somethin' atop the plateau.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's what Jerry says after one pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aver, anyway. Well, I figgered, if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't got the chart, I'd name the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island, anyway, and maybe get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to give you the slip when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed." And he shuddered. "I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruther be marooned, or risk cannibals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">than swing and sun-dry," he added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here," said Donovan, producing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flask. "Try a tot o' this, and then tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me what you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thankee," said the pirate, smack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his lips over the potion. "Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then," he continued in stronger tones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"this were the way of it. Slim were</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate, Blunt's first mate, some three</seg><seg type="columnLine">years back. I was bos'n. We'd made</seg><seg type="columnLine">good hauls, and the Sea Lion was fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">wallowing with pieces of eight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunder. But one or two had got</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, and we was posted, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripple widening. So Jerry--did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever meet up with Jerry?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Donovan, "though I just</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed him once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah," said McCallum, "he were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer coot, were Jerry Blunt!

'Pickle 'em in</seg><seg type="columnLine">brine!' he'd say then. 'They'll keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">better till Judgment Day.' Which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a sayin' he had when we makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em walk the plank."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, yes," said Donovan impa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiently.

So we stands for the Horn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and off into the big Pacific, a-sailin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a-sailin' from one island to an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, a-trading junk for pearls. Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring the Horn, it was like a picnic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the sea so smooth as the palm o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">your hand, and a new drink to sample</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But a man gets tired of anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time; and we was all for turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, gibbet or no gibbet.

Judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pemberton at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to dissuade</seg><seg type="columnLine">his crony, but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle George, with a volley of tremen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous, round oaths, declared that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have that treasure or die try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, the judge gave in and smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It isn't so much the treasure," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "as it is the adventure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. That's what is pulling at you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">George."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you, too, damn it!" cried my</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle. "You're going along, and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended to from the first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you'll need watching," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">his boon companion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Van Tassel at first said</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing whatever. His features were</seg><seg type="columnLine">enigmatical.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Veil, going around dot Horn ain'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">like picking flowers," he remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">when urged for his opinion.

We'll take every precau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion," Uncle George laughed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clapped him on the back. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed aloud, as excited over the pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect as any boy who is assured of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first peck over the horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor was he to be dissuaded by Aunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martha's exclamation of dismay when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reached home. She--the dear soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">--adored the man; and aside from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">little ejaculation, she had only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">question to ask.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know much about this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Donovan?" she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, little enough," he admitted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"However, that little is good. But even</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposing I am wrong alx&gt;ut the man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Van Tassel sails the ship, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we pick the crew. What could he do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing, I suppose," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, I suppose I'll have to let you</seg><seg type="columnLine">go, or you'll explode."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was much to do before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could up-anchor. Uncle George had</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to use the Anthony Wayne,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she being the fastest and the roomiest</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel in his fleet; but before she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">put to sea again she had to be careened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraped and repainted. We also</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipped four more long nines and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strengthened the bulwarks. Too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was the forecastle to be en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larged, as we wanted between twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five and thirty men forward, to deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">with strange natives, if needs be; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">since it was decided that the after</seg><seg type="columnLine">party would include the skipper, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate, my uncle, the judge, Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donovan, myself, three negro servants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Johannsen, our quartermaster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparations had to be made for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">housing. And there were also sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plies to be shipped for a voyage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">many months.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Added to this was Captain Van Tas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sel's problem in shipping his crew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Horn is enough to cause the</seg><seg type="columnLine">staunchest sailor a qualm or two, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our old hands only Johannsen, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quartermaster, O'Donnel, the bos'n,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anthony Buzzel, the coxswain, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walter Killifer, able seaman, signified</seg><seg type="columnLine">intention of signing on. Like Barnaby</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horn, the others took their share of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loot from the Retriever, and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">off for a wild fling. Barnaby, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">true, spent his share in less than two</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks and was begging for a berth</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon after; but the others had disap</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, our mission was well ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertised along the water front, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose the time will never comt when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EQUIPPED</seg><seg type="columnLine">12</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FRONTIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hardy souls cannot be found to brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Horn or any other danger for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake of sharing in buried treasure. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came about that Van Tassel re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived more applications than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed and was picking and choosing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to suit himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So. as the men were taken on from</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to time, he gathered a sturdy crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him--a hoarse-spoken, weather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaten, scarred and tarry lot, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks of many a barroom brawl upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, but capable, handy seamen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONOVAN, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meantime, took lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle part in the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditioning of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. For once he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to sail as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">passenger. He told</seg><seg type="columnLine">m e that Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Van Tassel might possibly feci a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">miffed, under his skin, and it was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well to stay clear of him for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like any old skipper," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling, "I might forget myself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make suggestions. And he wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that. It ain't in human nature."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He even carried this attitude to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of refusing to recommend sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men to Van Tassel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was seated with him one fine, sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiny afternoon on the veranda of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">inn--the George Washington, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">few sea captains ever went--when</seg><seg type="columnLine">three husky tars came rolling up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk and paused deferentially near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veranda rail. One was a smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">young Irishman, another was a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with queer albino eyes, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third a hairy, compact fellow, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">jowls like a gorilla, and a swarthy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dished-in, broad-nosed face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Could I have a word with you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cap'n Donovan ?" said the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthy, taking a pace forward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulling awkwardly at his forelock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Captain Donovan eyed the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather sternly. He had been given a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand pounds for his share of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoils, and lie was now rigged out like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an admiral.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And what may you want, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">man?" said he. To me, in an .aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">he added, "One of my old hands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, sir, we hears you're a-sail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for treasure somewheres,'' the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied.

"You go to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you wants, and if he takes you on</seg><seg type="columnLine">your own say so, well and good. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wants a word about you, why, I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">give it. But only in case, you mind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man saluted, and the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good men, all three," said Dono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">van, then. "Martin looks rough, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's an honest man, and there ain't no</seg><seg type="columnLine">better seaman.

I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, now,'' Donovan returned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at me sideways, with a shrewd</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile lighting his big, eloquent fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, "if skipper is miffed, would he</seg><seg type="columnLine">be like to take them men on my direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">put-in?

Shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward, lie joined us, at Donovan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheery hail. I could hardly hide my</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusement when I noted Jenkins'</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiant smile; for lie was such an ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirer of Donovan's that he almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran to us, like a dog to the whistle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His adoration was written all over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth, virile features. He had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the point where, all unconsciously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was imitating the giant's very tones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and every now and then was wont to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry, "Ay, by the Flying Dutchman!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">in laying stress to his remarks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you knows them swabs, eh?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Donovan, as they disappeared into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sailor's grog shop farther down, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the opposite side of the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, yes," said Jenkins, quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The key to one million pounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DEVIL S CALDRON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"That is, I know they're good seamen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and honest.

I'm going to give 'em a recom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mend to the skipper this afternoon."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, that's fine," commented Don-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ovan next day, when we noted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three men working aboard the Anthony</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wayne. "Let me out of it slick, too."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meanwhile I spent the greater part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my time aboard the Anthony</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wayne, counting the days until we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ready to go, and intensely inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested in everything that was going on</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard her. At last the supplies were</seg><seg type="columnLine">stowed away, the vessel was ready, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were summoned to go on board,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-six men all told. I remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">well how I thrilled when the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">white sails were broken out, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchor came up, and we stood on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean, white deck to wave good-by to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowds on shore. We were oft to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our great adventure at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE SIGHT THE ISLAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAT a journey that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was! From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very first it ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared that fortune</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended to smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">on our venture, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">we enjoyed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadiest of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">freshing breezes throughout, accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panied with the balmiest of weather,</seg><seg type="columnLine">save when rounding the Horn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everyone was comfortable aboard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The enlarging of the after cabin made</seg><seg type="columnLine">room for the construction of six snug</seg><seg type="columnLine">staterooms, three on each side, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle space clear for use as a din-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and lounging room. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample room for a broad oaken table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">several comfortable chairs, and a cush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioned settee under the stern ports in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the space aft of the lower companion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way; and there was also a lazaret,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Sam, my uncle's body servant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wont to display his skill at mixing</seg><seg type="columnLine">toddies, and a little chart-room on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">port side, forward, built especially for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skipper. The whole had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinted in green and white, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very cheerful in aspect. And the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward were enjoying far greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">space than might have !&gt;een allotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on an ordinary voyage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though my uncle was al&gt;oard, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was but one captain. He--my uncle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is--never so much as gave an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">order from the time we brought up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the anchor to the day we dropped it</seg><seg type="columnLine">again in Drake's Bay. Dirk Van Tas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sel was supreme on his own quarter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck, and he maintained discipline as</seg><seg type="columnLine">strict as that on a man-o'-war. Woe</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the shirker who tried to take ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage of the fact that there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">double the men ordinarily employed</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard! The brass work might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been used for mirrors by a primping</seg><seg type="columnLine">belle; the decks were holystoned until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were as clean as driven snow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was seldom a minute when those</seg><seg type="columnLine">on watch were not kept busy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On those who disagreed with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">program the captain's hand fell heav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily. But, on the whole, there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">very few incidents of this sort. This,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think, was due to the example of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man Fallon. He appeared to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewel. With his black, impish Celtic</seg><seg type="columnLine">features, his merry blue eyes, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing, golden smile, he was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">popular with the men; and he was ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to spring forward to the head of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line when a haul on a rope was</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed, and forever breaking out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cheery, rollicking chanty. As for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chum, Martin, that worthy remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same gruff, lowering gorilla of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">first encounter; but he, too, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">prompt and willing and quickly proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he knew his work from stem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I should think you might have rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ommended them!" I remarked one day</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Donovan. "There are no more able</seg><seg type="columnLine">seamen aboard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right you are!" Donovan declared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And have you noted Dumphey ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded, for the man's peculiar ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance would have attracted atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion anywhere. He was a blond giant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a great, round, moon-like face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat and sallow. He had scarcely any</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows over his slanting, albino eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his features, in repose, had some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about them that suggested the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mongolian. Yet when you spoke to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he was smiling on the instant;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he performed his duties with ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptional skill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A good man," I said; and later I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Captain Van Tassel speaking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to the mate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bedder as some I bicked mine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selluf," he grunted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the after cabin the feeling was</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellent--with the possible exception</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that between Donovan and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper. This never cropped above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface, but was manifested al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most imperceptibly. If Donovan spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, the captain always replied very</seg><seg type="columnLine">courteously--a little too courteously, if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">anything. He was impersonal in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression when looking at Donovan</seg><seg type="columnLine">--so impersonal, in fact, that I sensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a marked animosity which he was hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in check for the sake of pcace in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the party.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Donovan did not allow this to ruffle</seg><seg type="columnLine">his good spirits in the least. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inimitable way of telling a story,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with eloquent grimaces and a slap of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knee at the climax which set my</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle roaring with laughter and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge to chuckling till his fat stomach</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook. It was something to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of them sitting at the table, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brass lamp swinging, and the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining oti the ship's rippling wake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my uucle holding his toddy sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended when Donovan approached a</seg><seg type="columnLine">side-splitting end to his yarn. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skipper would forget to smoke on</seg><seg type="columnLine">these occasions, as he sat back, listen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; he would hold his pipe in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, leaning a bit forward, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching Donovan intently; and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the laugh was at its height, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought no one was watching him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would clap his pipe back in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, and eye Donovan through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifting smoke with a puzzled little</seg><seg type="columnLine">frown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's the best companion I've had</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a voyage!" my uncle exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">one day. "Even including yourself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Judge." And the judge chuckled, add-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a word of praise for the man on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own account.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," Uncle George went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, "I don't know the man from a ton</seg><seg type="columnLine">of coal. But I can't see but what lie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">trustworthy, all through." And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head. "I sense," he contin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ued, "that Van Tassel doesn't like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, though he never says a word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, that's to be expected, I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose.

Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again he would go on the poop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the mate was on watch; but none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us thought anything of this at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, for Jenkins' admiration for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was so manifest that all noted it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A good boy," said my uncle, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been in my sendee--let's see, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FRONTIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--yes, three years.

London Tower, the highest</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill, with Kidd's Mauley, the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">highest, were first to be sighted. Lon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don Tower rose clear above the trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon its lower slopes, a great spire of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jagged, naked, white and yellow rock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kidd's Mauley seemed to have no veg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">etation whatever, save in isolated</seg><seg type="columnLine">patches, around the base, and was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly mass of corrugated granite slabs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembling a clenchcd fist holding aloft</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broken blade of a dagger. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Execution Knob, Binnacle Hill and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowsprit Bluff were surmounted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall, stately pines; and when we came</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer still and steered a course which</seg><seg type="columnLine">took us past Dead Man's Locker and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the eastern coast of the penin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sula, Blackbeard's Boot, we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">transported with delight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never have I looked on a more en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trancing terrain. The broad, low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently-sloping sandy beach beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white coral reefs looked like a boule-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vard paved with gold. Millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">highly-colored sea-shells lay in a long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinuous ridge at the last high-tide</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark, and the smooth wet strip be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween this ridge and the water was</seg><seg type="columnLine">peppered with them. Long-legged</seg><seg type="columnLine">cranes, with bright, green feathers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and great red bills, hopped here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, looking at us curiously, or un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">concernedly digging for clams; while</seg><seg type="columnLine">at other places we saw great mons-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trous turtles waddling awkwardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the sea. At the inner edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beach there rose a fringe of coco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nut palms, sometimes thinning out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single row, sometimes thickening into</seg><seg type="columnLine">compact groves. Interstudded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were mango trees, and short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarfed, gnarled yellow oaks; and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind them, on the footslopes, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick growths of palms, mahogany.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ebony, and other trees, with thick moss</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging from them, and a profligate</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth of foliage displaying every</seg><seg type="columnLine">color in the rainbow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I had never seen such brilliant reds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such flashing tints of green, such glar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing patches of yellow, nor such deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">shades of purple. Kissed by the golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight, the whole shore line made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">delightful picture for men long at sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look upon; while the high undulat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ridge behind this wondrous growth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thickly overgrown with stately</seg><seg type="columnLine">pines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Devil's Caldron?" cried my</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle.

Everywhere we found the chart</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be accurate; though, for that mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, there was scarce need for the lead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was like sailing on air, the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so smooth and transparent, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the bottom lay at over twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five fathoms in many places, we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">always see it as clearly as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking down at it through a clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">skylight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The anchorage was even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">charming than the country on the east-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern slopes of Blackbeard's Boot. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were broad, gently sloping strips of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand on either side, with an even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">abundant growth of beautiful palms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and foliage beyond them, and all tinted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with gaudy colors. The western slope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Blackbeard's Boot was more preci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitate than that on the opposite side;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but, save for one knoll, the mainland</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirting Drake's Bay rose very grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually to the foot of the big plateau.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were many open places in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">terrain in that part of the island.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some resembled the green meadows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the colonies, while others were covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a thick growth of tough, yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass. But the growth of trees pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominated here, as it did on the steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">slopes of the plateau.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air was filled with the fragrant</seg><seg type="columnLine">odors from the foliage; and, though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was after four o'clock, or eight bells,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we dropped anchor, my uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">delighted me by announcing that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take the cabin party ashore to</seg><seg type="columnLine">"stretch a leg," as he put it. Then, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the men looking longingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoreward, he looked appealingly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Van Tassel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can't start out ship-shape for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the treasure until tomorrow morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">--or at any rate, there's no need to,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Uncle George. "So, if it won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">interfere with discipline-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ve let 'em go ashore to sphend the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, vot?" said the captain, grinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little.

"Let 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">have three kegs of ale, and a lunch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men were piped up at once, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they received the news with a cheer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It required no prodding to set them</seg><seg type="columnLine">bustling in preparation for the picnic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime, as our own gig was low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered away, I caught a glimpse of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate, Jenkins.

But at once he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed down over the rail into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Following his pointing finger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw a great green shark swimming</seg><seg type="columnLine">lazily within a few feet of the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Smaller fishes were scurrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from him; but, farther down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where long seaweeds, with fat, yellow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular stems and bulbs like gourds</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the end, were wafting about on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom, I saw an octopus. And near</seg><seg type="columnLine">him I discerned three skeletons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Human!" said Jenkins. "They give</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a kind of a turn."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The niggers!" I exclaimed--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">called my uncle's attention to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, at the time, I thought little of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jenkins' statement, since many a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardened man than he has been af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fected by similar sights. It was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">later that I remembered a little look</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Donovan gave him. My uncle tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Donovan's arm and beckoning me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow, I forgot about the matter al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are coming with us, aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Captain?" said my uncle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DEVIL'S CALDRON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir," the skipper replied. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">half some vork--also I safe mineselluf</seg><seg type="columnLine">for der climb tomorrow." And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded at the steep sides of the distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">plateau. "Mr. Jenkins," he added,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you vill half to shtay abort tomorrow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so you go now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jenkins seemed to hesitate a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">before answering. But, remembering</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, he said, "Very well, sir," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved to join us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">E WERE no sooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore than Dono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">van gave a cry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach. There lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">another skeleton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Approaching it, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw rotten bits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope still fastened about the wrist</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones, which had been drawn behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One of them niggers that walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plank," said Donovan. "Washed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up by the tide, and left for the birds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Flying Dutchman!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor devil!" said Uncle George.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, we'll bury him, anyway."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forthwith we kicked sand over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">partially covered bones, and went 011.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jenkins and Donovan paired off</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly, as did the judge and my uncle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I busied myself digging for tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle's eggs, examining the quaint shells</seg><seg type="columnLine">and climbing mango trees for some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the luscious fruit. And so, being pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied, the time slipped by rapidly;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finally, after pausing to pelt rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a great crocodile 011 a rotting log, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded a spit not far to southward</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the river's mouth just as it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing dusk. There I came upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gruesome sight which brought me up</seg><seg type="columnLine">short.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> High up in the sands, and in a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of circular pit, lay the blackened em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers of a great fire. How recent it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been I could not tell. But there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of blurred footprints about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one great beaten path running in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a circle around the pit--a trough, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">might say, churned out by stamping</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in a horrid dance. A broken war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">club, with ugly knobs, lay close by,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while not far from it were a long flint</seg><seg type="columnLine">spearhead and a cracked bow. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, scattered carelessly about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, were at least four human skulls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a litter of human bones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My shout brought my uncle up 011 a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog trot, the judge following at a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">sedate pace, Donovan and young Jen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kins, halting in the distance, began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">retrace their steps, while three of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seamen nearby also moved to join us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cannibals," said my uncle, at once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a shudder of revulsion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Might be slaughter for some sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of weird ceremony," the judge com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented. Then, as Donovan came up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked, "What do you make of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Donovan?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why," said the giant, with a wry</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimace, "it looks to me as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's some as has stronger stomachs</seg><seg type="columnLine">than mine, by the Flying Dutchman!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Cannibals," my uncle repeated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Looking round about him curiously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he added, "I'm fairly sure, though, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island isn't inhabited."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three seamen coming up just</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, they paused, with an appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nausea and horror; and, as Dono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">van replied, "Why, that swab McCal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lum said there weren't sign 0' life</seg><seg type="columnLine">here," the men looked round about ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehensively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Begging your pardon, sir," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">one--a man named Ayotte--"but we'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in a tight hole, I'm thinking, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was such swabs loose around</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tush!" cried my uncle, at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing where the wind lay.

Then, to add to the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression, one of them cried out ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citedly, and pointed upward. We had</seg><seg type="columnLine">all been standing, with our eyes held</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the horror, as though by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">devilish magnet; but now, looking up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we all exclaimed simultaneausly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SWARM -- an</seg><seg type="columnLine">army -- a veritable</seg><seg type="columnLine">host of huge bats</seg><seg type="columnLine">was circling over</seg><seg type="columnLine">our heads.

Their bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">were as large as that of a small dog;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wingspread was that of an eagle;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, as they flew just over the tree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tops, we could see their heads, shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat like that of a calf, and their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rows of sharp little white teeth as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked down at us and bared their</seg><seg type="columnLine">gums.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a judgment!" wailed Harry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Newell, one of the young hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard, flinging himself prone.

Horn echoed Newell. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of us, and 110 mistake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poof!" snorted the judge contempt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uously. "They're nothing but big bats,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as harmless as the smaller breed if let</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone.

Donovan boomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, with a hearty chuckle. "Get back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your pins, there, my lad," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Newell. "What kind of seamanly</seg><seg type="columnLine">behavior is that? Well, now. men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see what it is to be cddicated. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've seen the same thing myself in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropics.

Though some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">older hands said they had seen bats of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this size before now, and the repulsive</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals settled quietly in the treetops</seg><seg type="columnLine">with 110 effort to attack us, most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were still uneasy. Those grin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning teeth suggested the larger molars</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the men believed had stripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the human bones at their feet; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole took a morbid grip on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">imaginations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Think you'd better order them back</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard?" the judge suggested, draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my uncle aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Uncle George.

Great lizards scampered away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from underfoot; twice we sighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">crocodiles sunning themselves at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the little swamps; monkeys</seg><seg type="columnLine">chattered at us from every treetop;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and great birds, some with red and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some with green bills, screamed at us</seg><seg type="columnLine">with raucous, ear-splitting cries. Once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long way off, we sighted a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">deer, much smaller than our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">American species; while on another</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion a drove of wild hogs, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">long curved tusks, charged out of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth of thick yellow grass and gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loped away into the jungle. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, we saw black beetles, as long as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's hand, and paused once to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">a terrific battle between an army of</seg><seg type="columnLine">black ants and a fierce horde of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">red species. The latter, though much</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smaller, seemed to be forging to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward victory, as they fought in groups,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with every appearance of organization.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nature of the country, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed us more than the animals and</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds upon it. For example, the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">patches we had stipixxsed to be mea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows turned out to be bodies of limpid</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, with green reeds thrusting up</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the surface. The water could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be seen through the thick growth</seg><seg type="columnLine">until one approached close up. Also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Uncle George led us forward, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">chart and compass, we were forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut our way through, or turn aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">from growths of heavy vines--some</seg><seg type="columnLine">as thick as a man's arm. and some,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when cut through, spouting a thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream of cool, clear water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nature providing water for these</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees," explained the judge. "It prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably doesn't rain here for six months</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a stretch. Note how these water</seg><seg type="columnLine">vines trend upward toward the river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the falls, or the lake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was not a sign of any path,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor any other trace of human habita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. In fact, as we pressed westward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the growth of vines became thicker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Near the bay, where the soil was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandy, we had found many open</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaces; on the rising ground near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot of the plateau the soil was darker</seg><seg type="columnLine">and much more fertile. The foliage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the trees was so thick overhead here</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we worked under a canopy in. a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool twilight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, as we began to mount the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep sides of the plateau, we noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">other odd freaks of nature. The great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tableland seemed to be formed, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most part, from a volcanic up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaval of coral rock; and the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil lay only in patches and was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a foot in depth at any place. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees one hundred feet in height were</seg><seg type="columnLine">reared on this surface. They main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained their precarious grip and bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance by spreading out their roots, flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise. along the surface, in radial pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jections ; nor did they pause with this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their limbs reached out to take grips</seg><seg type="columnLine">on other trees, or, turning downward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread out roots of their own on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground to aid the mother tree. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of the gigantic trunks had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">outshoots whatever for a full seventy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five feet above ground. Many of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare trunks had no bark, and were so</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly worm-eaten they reminded me</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Egyptian obelisks, illustrated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my schoolbooks; but, like all the others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their limbs shot out in all directions</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the top and were so thick with</seg><seg type="columnLine">green foliage that we could not see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've gained one thing, anyway,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">my uncle said once, with a laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what's that?" the judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">panted, mopping his red face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, when we get home and tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">what we've seen, we'll be rated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">biggest liars in the country.

To westward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and running from north to south, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ridge of coral rock, bare of vegeta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.

Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the results any better with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next nearest rock--which was fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten points off the magnetic north line</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned on the chart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gloomily we trooped over the ridge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No one seemed to want to speak the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts in his mind.

At the outset, we reasoned, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">may merely have intended to safeguard</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own interests in bargaining for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. But later, having sounded out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impressionable Jenkins thoroughly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had worked out a bolder scheme.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We knew now that the mate had suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded in getting at least three accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plices aboard--Fallon, Dumphey and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin--and had but to wait for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorable opportunity to seize the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, they would probably have</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken her last night, while wc slept, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men hadn't come aboard," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the judge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Uncle George spat vindictively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doubtless," he acknowledged.

Some of the rest moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">more slowly; but at the time no one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them declared his intention of accept-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Gentry's offer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, well," said Gentry, "we'll see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what we'll sec. Them as changes their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind can work round to the other side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this here bay, and I'll send a boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore. There's a ford further up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, you'll find." Then, waving his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand at us, he ordered his men to pull</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gentry's STRENGTH GROWS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Y	remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubts about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriousness of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">position were now</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept away. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no boats; re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking the ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be an impossibility. Even a strongly</seg><seg type="columnLine">barricaded raft was out of the ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. We had brought only two axes</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore with us and could not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">constructed anything suitable even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though we spent a week at it, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns would have swept our deck clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we had fairly left the shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime there was the problem of</seg><seg type="columnLine">defence, as well as that of existence to</seg><seg type="columnLine">solve--with one meal gone from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-day's supply of accustomed diet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the prospect of subsisting there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">after on coconuts, mangoes, wild hog,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deer. Too, we had a doubtful</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew. One glance at the unsmiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">features about us assured me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of them would ultimately prefer</seg><seg type="columnLine">the far-off risk of swinging from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gibbet to sharing our dubious lot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We held a brief council, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men moved apart and muttered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Id's der loss of tobacco and der</seg><seg type="columnLine">t'ought of dem cannibals more as any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing we haf to fear about der men,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the skipper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thereupon he declared that we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once find a position where water</seg><seg type="columnLine">was obtainable and which would com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bine some degree of comfort as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the means of defense. Pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">southward, he announced that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted a cave, when entering the bay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which might suit our purpose admir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I saw a prook running down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">t'rough mine glasses," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Forthwith he gave orders to move,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and within a half hour we had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It needed but a glance to assure us</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we could have found no better</seg><seg type="columnLine">place for our immediate needs. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern was located in the face of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluff, or promontory, about one hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet above the level of the bay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and midway between the river mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the footslopes of Kidd's Mauley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From its mouth one could obtain a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair view of the bay to northward, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as the entrance, through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoes might come. The approach to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was steep, and clear of trees for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards or more. And the in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">terior was large enough to house a</seg><seg type="columnLine">regiment in comfort, with a clean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandy floor, a bubbling spring with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brook running from it, and, better still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a natural opening nearby in the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">to allow for the passage of smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once within, the skipper took im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediate steps for the prevention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men deserting with their arms. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">muskets, pistols and powder horns, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as the cutlases, were placed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of Johannsen, who arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in neat rows. The men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">given to understand that arms would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be issued only to hunters, or in case of</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack. The rations were also pooled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned over to our three negro</seg><seg type="columnLine">servants, who were to act as cooks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while my uncle and the judge were</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately despatched to try their</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck in bagging a wild hog or deer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another detail, meantime, was sent out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cut firewood and fell logs for a bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ricade, while the rest were sent out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make what progress they could before</seg><seg type="columnLine">sundown in gathering mangoes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">coconuts, and digging clams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even this activity did not serve</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep many of the men from brood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. When r.ight fell, four of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to return. The acquisition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunderson, Johannsen and Killifer</seg><seg type="columnLine">had raised our numbers to twenty-five,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving seven on board ship, and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Kidd's Mauley; now we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-one to the buccaneers' thirteen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When a man was sent to hail the sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tries on Kidd's Mauley, he was greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a musket shot, whereupon he</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptly deserted us, raising the pi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rates' crew to fourteen, and reducing</seg><seg type="columnLine">ours to twenty. Nor were the minor</seg><seg type="columnLine">events of the evening designed to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">our men happier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had brought but one large coffee</seg><seg type="columnLine">pot ashore, with two frying pans; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pot proved to be leaky. Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">George and the judge also returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">without any game. They had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighted a deer; while the wild hogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">scampered so swiftly, they said, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was useless to fire. They declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these hogs, like our domestic</seg><seg type="columnLine">porkers, loved mud, and sought dense</seg><seg type="columnLine">patches of grass which shielded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oozy bottom from the sun; they fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther pointed out that it would be quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to bag them by stationing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunters at one end of a glade, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps two others to charge in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rout the hogs out at a given signal;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but this optimistic conjecture failed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">arouse any enthusiasm. The men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dumps. They muttered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowned, and were surly in their an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swers; and shortly after supper, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DEVIL'S CALDRON,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the men were split up into little groups</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the cavern, talking matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, two more slipped away into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eighteen," said my uncle, when in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed of this. "That gives them</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen.

Hence Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">George had all hands piped up before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and made them a brief speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll admit our chances look bad,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "We can live, I am sure;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but when a ship will put in here I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">say. If worse comes to worse we</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be here a year or--" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged. "Our best chance," he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, "is to waylay them and cut them</seg><seg type="columnLine">off when they come ashore for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure. They will come, in time, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am sure; I think Gentry's talk of go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to Botany Bay was sheer bluff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I'll say this: now we're in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole, all those who stay with us will</seg><seg type="columnLine">receive treble the shares promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, providing we recover the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">and treasure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah. but that's like promising the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon," Horn spoke up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Granted," returned my uncle. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you to decide."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of the whole crew only one had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage and manhood to state his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentions openly. This was Gunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. He rose, frowning, and said that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his part, he intended to join Gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It ain't like mutiny," he cried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarsely. "I wouldn't go agin my</seg><seg type="columnLine">dooty, not me. Not with half a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live.

Then, as Gunderson wheeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hurried out of the cavern, Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">George looked round about, eyeing one</seg><seg type="columnLine">man after another. "Any more?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried. "Let's clear the air here. De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cide now, once and for all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not a man answered; not a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I take it you're all to stay,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Uncle George. "Come, now,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that's not so bad. Seventeen to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventeen. If we hang out long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, they're bound to try for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure--and then is our chance. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've a mind to, we'll do them yet."</seg><seg type="columnLine">This seemed to buoy up the men for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time being; and on top of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Judge Pemberton revealed a side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nature which I, for one, had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspected. Talking to the cabin party,</seg><seg type="columnLine">presumably, as we lay on the sand at</seg><seg type="columnLine">on side of the fire, his slow, drawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones had soon caught the attention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. The man must have been aching</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every joint; the climb to the plateau</seg><seg type="columnLine">had all but finished him, I thought;</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet here he was, recounting droll negro</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories as though safe at home in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">library, till the cavern rang with shouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of laughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a revelation I have never for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten, for I saw clearly then the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference there is between true brav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery and courage born of brute strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">and good physical condition. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">even greater than the difference be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween steel and iron. It was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, when I was standing a turn on</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard, and most of the crew were</seg><seg type="columnLine">snoring heavily, that I heard him sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">press a groan as he tried to adjust his</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft, strained muscles to his hard bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No desertions occurring during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, and the men expressing nervous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness over snakes and other animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">that might be prowling about, Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Van Tassel decided to issue pistols</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cutlases once more to all hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The powder horns, muskets, and shot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, were retained under guard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each man having only the two rounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his pistol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LL during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed more cheer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful than they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">when first brood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over their situ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation. Clay was</seg><seg type="columnLine">found to patch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee pot; a big haul of clams was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made on the nearby beach; Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">George shot a wild hog; and another</seg><seg type="columnLine">man killed a big turtle. Meantime the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work on the barricade went on stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily so that, with logs and earth, we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">erected a bullet-proof wall across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth of the cavern before noon ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servation. There were no loop-holes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was breast high, and afforded</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample protection for all but the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shoulders when aiming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But we were still handicapped for</seg><seg type="columnLine">means with which to cook our food</seg><seg type="columnLine">properly; and, our first attempts at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">moulding clay utensils proving fail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures, Yens Eriskson, the bos'n's mate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared that afternoon. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen running along the beach toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river's mouth by Johannsen, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired a shot at him, but missed. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduced our party to sixteen. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at supper time, another accident oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred which had its effect in causing</seg><seg type="columnLine">further gloom. Anthony Buzzel, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coxswain, having professed a knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of baking clay, fashioned a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">pot and glazed it over the fire. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had cooled it appeared quite hard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Buzzel stood back, surveying it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a proud smirk. Thereupon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">negro cooks set out to make a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">potage, with water, wild hog meat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship's biscuit; but when the mess was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubbling merrily the pot suddenly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">integrated and all was lost. The re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maining pieces of the hog were</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorched in the hurried efforts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooks to broil them, spitted on long</seg><seg type="columnLine">sticks; and, after gnawing at them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buzzel and Barnaby Horn seized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first opportunity, immediately after</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark, to slip away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fourteen, and they are now</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty," said my uncle, frowning. ±i</seg><seg type="columnLine">this keeps up, Gentry'll have enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">by tomorrow night to wipe us out any</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he sees fit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had posted a sentry with a glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the cavern to watch the ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this man had reported gigs going</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore now and again during the day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but with only a few men aboard. An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other had gone down the bay toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kidd's Mauley and returned, doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less carrying a relief for the lookouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. And now we saw the glow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great fire on the beach, directly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore from the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Spending a night ashore, perhaps,1"■</seg><seg type="columnLine">said my uncle. "But we'd best be sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it means, eh, Captain?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Van Tassel nodding, I vol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">unteered to do a bit of scouting. Kill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ifer also spoke up, and, armed with'</seg><seg type="columnLine">muskets and pistols, we set out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moon had not yet appeared, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had little difficulty in working our</seg><seg type="columnLine">way through the palms, without de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tection, to a point within earshot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buccaneers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For quite a period we could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of any consequence, as there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a round dozen in the circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the fire, and all shouting or</seg><seg type="columnLine">singing at once in a merry bedlam. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">keg of brandy had been broached, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pannikins were being passed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to hand. Gentry sat to one side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a log, with Jenkins beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All were heavily armed; discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">22</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FRONTIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">meant almost certain death for us; yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were several points which almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">made me laugh aloud. Every man</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, including the recent deserter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Erickson, aped his new commander.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their heads were wrapped with col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ored scarfs; bright sashes adorned</seg><seg type="columnLine">their waists; and they wore their head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress cock-a-pie, over one eye, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gentry did, and even attempted to im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itate him in the way he had of turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">his remarkably shrewd eyes aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">without turning his head. When they</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose, and moved about, they swag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered like a bucko mate ashore at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">longshoremen's picnic; when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke, they used tones at least an</seg><seg type="columnLine">octave below those I had heard when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were honest hands aboardship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They used the most dreadful oaths,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each seeming to vie with the others in</seg><seg type="columnLine">coining new expletives; but whenever</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gentry spoke, or reached out with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pannikin, it was laughable to see them</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall silent instantly, or stumble over</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another in an effort to serve him</seg><seg type="columnLine">first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah!" he would say, sitting there</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his air of superb assurance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thankee for that, Bill.

Or, having downed a potion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would cry, "Well, now, you tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">this: does this sort of life beat being</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazed afore the mast, with a few dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars when port is reached--or doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?"

The directions, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fair enough," said Erickson; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buccaneers chorused an agreement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Gentry turned once more to</seg><seg type="columnLine">young Jenkins and the men fell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">singing, Killifer suggested going. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had at least learned one point; the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximate location of the treasure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I insisted on remaining in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes of learning more about their</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was well that we did. A half</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour passed; I was beginning to itch</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over and aching to ease myself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when suddenly a shot sounded from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction of the cavern, followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by three more in rapid succession.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The buccaneers were on their feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That wouldn't be Allen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thompson on Kidd's Mauley, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?" cried Jenkins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't think so," said Gentry. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer. No; it's near that cave."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And suddenly he grinned. "Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what would you say if it was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">mates a-breakin' away for to jine us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His guess proved correct. Within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half hour we heard voices on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach; and the buccaneers, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed their places about the fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped up once more, muskets in hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who goes?" roared Gentry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Five more to ship with Cap'n</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gentry, sir," came the voice of a sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man named Latham from the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come up, then, one at a time,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Gentry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The five were shortly standing be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore him: three white sailors, and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the negro servants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Gentry, "what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened? Ah, Nero," to one of the ne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">groes, "I see you're wounded in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm. Here, there, Erickson, you take</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hands and go aboard ship for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">medical kit. Can't let a new messmate</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's like this, sir," said Latham,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Erickson and his crew departed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That damned hazer of a Dutchman</seg><seg type="columnLine">sends out the five of us under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bos'n, O'Donnell, to cut more firewood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So I put it up to him, O'Donnell I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean, to go. Well, he wouldn't, be</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, and with that Larry here hit him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clip with the butt of his pistol. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down, and we started. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got two shots at us, one getting Nero.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We fired back, but don't know whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">we hit him or not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anyway, you are here," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gentry. "Ha!" He paused to reckon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, that makes us twenty-five now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and them--let's see--only nine left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men, we'll start for the treasure first</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing tomorrow morning.

My own musket thundered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second later, but, though I had aimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Gentry, he seemed to leap aside, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if warned by instinct; and someone</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him cried out in pain. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Killifer and I were off, running for</seg><seg type="columnLine">our lives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ambuscade</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE pursuit was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">full cry on the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant. Musket balls</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thickets about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us; pistols cracked</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind us; and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we burst out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush and made for the beach, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no danger of being tripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">by vines, the buccaneers came thunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DEVIL'S CALDRON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing after us like so many enraged</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolves in sight of quarry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twice I paused to wheel and fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">my double-barreled pistols. Killifer</seg><seg type="columnLine">also fired; but, for all we could tell in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness, our shots did not take ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect. On the contrary, the flashes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our pistols seemed only to serve in lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cating us more nearly so that the an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swering shots whistled perilously close.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twice I was showered with sand from</seg><seg type="columnLine">hits close to my heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had, of course, the advantage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fair start; yet we had run but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short distance southward along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard-packed sand below the high-tide</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark when I heard one runner pound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing along behind me and gaining with</seg><seg type="columnLine">every step. He had an obstruction in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one nostril which caused a shrill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistling sound whenever he breathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly; and I knew him for the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All in vain were my efforts to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him behind. He came up on me like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an antelope, overhauling me, so to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak, hand over hand. I had not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot left; at any minute I expected a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol ball in the back. But he also</seg><seg type="columnLine">had discharged his pistols, it appeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for as he came up close behind me, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">aimed a cut at me with his heavy cut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">las.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He panted as he struck, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade sung as it sliced through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. I lunged forward barely in time;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point nicked my right shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slashed a rent in the back of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cut must have thrown him off</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stride an instant, for he lost a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ground. But he soon regained it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And again he cut at me with all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength, the blade fairly whistling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its vicious, downward whip. I avoided</seg><seg type="columnLine">it only by a desperate leap aside, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point seemed to miss my neck by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bare inch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Killifer, meantime, was a good ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in the lead. It was useless to</seg><seg type="columnLine">call on him for assistance; we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not stop to engage the man for long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his comrades were not far behind;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, realizing that another cut might</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the mark, I gained several steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a terrific burst of speed. This lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle gain enabled me to grasp the muzzle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my musket in both hands. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Martin closed in once more, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cutlas raised aloft, I wheeled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung the gun with all my strength.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stock and cutlas met with a ringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash. The hanger was knocked from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand, and went sailing toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treetops; and as his impetus carried</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him forward I raised my right foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and planted it savagely full in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach. He staggered backward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent over, and gasped in agony. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him no chance to recover. Whip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping the musket aloft, I brought every</seg><seg type="columnLine">thew into play as I brought it down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stock beat down his upflung arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught him fair, with a sickening</seg><seg type="columnLine">crunch, on the side of the head, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke off short. Martin struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands with a plop like that of a heavy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laden sack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hoarse yell not twenty feet away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed by another pistol shot, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent me wings, and I flew along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands once more after Killifer, throw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing aside the useless barrel as I went.</seg><seg type="columnLine">None of the remaining buccaneers</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtook us. After a half dozen more</seg><seg type="columnLine">futile shots, they gave over the pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit; and at last, panting and sobbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for breath, we reached the cavern in</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God!" cried Uncle George, throw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his arms around me. "God 1" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed unable to find any other word</seg><seg type="columnLine">to express his thankfulness for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape, and nearly choked me in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">embrace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once we had regained our breath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our story was soon told. Thereupon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain ordered immediate steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken for defence against a possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack. Angered by the death of Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin and Latham, and excited with</seg><seg type="columnLine">brandy, it seemed altogether likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they would be upon us as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon had risen; so all muskets</seg><seg type="columnLine">were loaded, cutlases and pistols laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to hand, and six of us posted at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barricade. O'Donnell, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffered a deep gash on the head, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the negro, Sam, were told off to aid</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skipper in reloading.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How anxiously we peered into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness you may well imagine. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">two deaths had left Gentry with</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-three men; he was more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely to use eighteen or twenty in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack; and we were now nine in num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber. The list included Johannsen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Killifer, the judge, my uncle, the skip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per, the negro slave, O'Donnell, a sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man named Suggs, and me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Vun t'ing," said the captain. "Ve</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">can now count on all here.

But, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon came up and bathed the slope</seg><seg type="columnLine">before us in a sheen of beautiful sil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ver, we saw no sign of movement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Nor were we disturbed during the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">two weary hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess id iss he figgers to get der.</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreasure abort first," said the captain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then. Forthwith the fire was rekind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">led, and we were divided into two</seg><seg type="columnLine">watches--Johannsen, Killifer, Sam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I in the one, and the judge, Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">George, Suggs and O'Donnell in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. My uncle's watch was left 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard, with one sentry posted, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay down to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About four in the morning the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain roused all hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surbrise iss der t'ing," he declared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and outlined briefly a daring plan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The mutineers, he reasoned, would do</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of two things--attack us, or go</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the treasure. In either case he</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposed to get in the first telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow. To do this, he now ordered us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take two muskets and two pistols</seg><seg type="columnLine">apiece, and follow him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were soon trooping after him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">munching a breakfast of raisins and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chcese as we marched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sky overhead was still dark as</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitch, but in the western fringe of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">black bowd hung the morning moon of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tropics, a great round yellow disk,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembling a lighted port-hole in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid wall of ebony. It gave light</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for us to pick our way rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the palms above the tide</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark; and within a half hour we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a position in the thickets over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking the anchorage and the river's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. We did not sight a single pi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate on the wray; for only the smoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering embers of their fire remained,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and apparently all had gone aboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a man shall fire till I gifs der</seg><seg type="columnLine">vord," said the captain.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can never forget the picture made by</seg><seg type="columnLine">that motley crew--Gentry in the stern,</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffing tranquilly at a pipe, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, with their sleeves rolled high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying back and forth on the oars to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fallon's steady chant. I particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember the red silk handkerchief in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breast pocket of Buzzel's gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt, revealed each time as he pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back on his oar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dake aim!" said the captain then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I, for one, aimed as steadily as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, fair at Buzzel's shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fire!" cried the skipper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The muskets roared in a volley that</seg><seg type="columnLine">smote the air like a clap of thunder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Erickson pitched forward.

One second saw us going over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barricade; the next--or so it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to me at the time--we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashing into them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course they fired; and of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">it must have taken us a good quarter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a minute to reach the woods. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard the reports, saw the smoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and felt the wind of the whistling bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets as in a dream. Then I saw a form</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me--that of the mate, Jenkins</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and ran at him with my cutlas raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">on high.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He screamed in terror. His pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">was discharged full in my face; yet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same heart-beat he had gone down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a great gash in the neck. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid the highest price for his treach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery, being dead before he struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">S HE fell, the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">round me was rent</seg><seg type="columnLine">with shots, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clashing of steel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage shouts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">howls of p a i n.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eight pirates had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been left ashore;</seg><seg type="columnLine">one had run when we were half-way</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the slope; now Barnaby threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">down his musket and fled for his life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I noted this from the tail of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye, I heard a bloodthirsty roar, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled just in time to see the cook,</seg><seg type="columnLine">LeBlanc, come rushing at me, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">musket clubbed and raised high over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head. But the blow never fell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle George discharged his pistol,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, even as I dodged aside and stum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled over Jenkins' dead body, LeBlanc</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed, dropped his gun, clutched</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his side, and pitched to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Killifer, meantime, leaped over him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cut down the buccaneer behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with a single blow; and as I leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my feet, the skipper shot down</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunderson. The big Albino, Dum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phey, and the man beside him then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and whipped into the thickets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the judge and O'Donnell in close</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuit. Only a tree saved Dum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phey's worthless life, for the judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">aimed a cut at him which would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">split him in half, had the blade not</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the trunk. As it was, Dum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phey's shirt was soaked with blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">from wounds received a moment be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"To the beach, to the beach!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">panted the skipper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DEVIL'S CALDRON.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">27</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had only a few steps to take;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but when we arrived there, our hearts</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell. There was no gig in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Back, den!" cried the skipper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"See--der gun!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We dodged back among the trees as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gun roared on board ship, scatter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing slugs through the foliage all</seg><seg type="columnLine">around us. But all had taken cover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no one was hit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hurriedly, then, we took stock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation. Johannsen was hob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling painfuly down the slope, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet in the calf of his right leg.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suggs had been killed by Dumphey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutlas. The judge had been shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the flesh over his ribs, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left side; my own face was blackened</seg><seg type="columnLine">with powder, and the lobe of my right</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear had been shot off; while Killifer</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a deep cut in the thigh. Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">George also displayed a bleeding scalp</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound and a dented belt buckle, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bullet had struck and glanced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The death of Suggs, and Johannsen's</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg wound left us with only six men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who could be counted on as able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear muskets; and some of these were</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtful, if fever set in. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buccaneers, on the other hand, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffered much more heavily. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead man on the slope, killed earlier</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the day, and the three who had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">died cut their number to fifteen. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these fifteen we saw at a glance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunderson would never aid them</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, even if he were lucky enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to survive; for he had been shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the body, and was now groan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in dire pain. Two others, we knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been severely wounded prior to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, so that we had now but a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">able men to cope with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One thing gave us immediate aid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this was the finding of three bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tles of brandy. It strengthened our</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded wonderfully. We also listed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our loot four tobacco pouches, four</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipes, a flint and tinder, four sailor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">clasp knives, six muskets, three cut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lases, five pistols, four powder horns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">four shot pouches, and a large sack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of provisions which they had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, after staunching the wounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our enemy, Gunderson, as best we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, and performing a like service</seg><seg type="columnLine">for ourselves, Captain Van Tassel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Donnell took position with two mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kets apiece near the shore. Firing from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind tree trunks, they kept the buc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caneers aboard ship dodging behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bulwarks while we removed our</seg><seg type="columnLine">loot and assisted Killifer and Johann-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sen up the slope to the cavern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TIIE CALDRON SEETHES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">E reached the cave</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">without further cas-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ualties. The very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">daring of our sud-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">den, savage attack</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had dumbfounded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the buccaneers. We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heard Gentry roar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing like a lion on board the ship; but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he could not force his men to stand at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an open gun port; and such musket</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shots as were fired at us while O'Don-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nell and the captain reloaded were hur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ried and badly aimed. Finally, when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the last pair of us was over the breast-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">works, the pirates ceased firing alto-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gether, and kept out of sight behind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the bulwarks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We were glad enough of the re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spite, for Killifer and the judge were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bleeding profusely; and Johannsen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was suffering intensely with the ball</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in his leg. We managed to staunch the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wounds of the first two with cool</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">water from the spring, while Uncle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">George, gritting his teeth, made shift</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to extract the bullet from the quarter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">master's calf with our only surgical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">instrument -- a sailor's clasp-knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Strong as Johannsen was, he fainted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dead away when the ball came out at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">last, and Uncle George was little bet-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ter. But a drink of brandy brought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them round again; and at last we were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">able to stretch out on the sand for a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much needed rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I suppose," said the judge, "that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we're cocks of the walk now on shore,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at any rate, and Gentry won't make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">another attempt to get the treasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In fact, I wouldn't l&gt;e surprised if he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sailed away to get hands with better</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stomach for his work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We all agreed that this seemed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">likely; and that night, when the skip-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">per and O'Donnell had returned, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we heard the men on board singing at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the capstan bars, we listened with a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mixture of relief and despair. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were raising the anchor, we thought,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to sail away; and though this meant a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cessation of fighting with buccaneers,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we still had the possibility of cannibals</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to think of, and a dreary battle for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mere existence as well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Even when we heard the plunge of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the anchor later on, we were not much</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heartened. It meant that Gentry had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moved out of gunshot from the shore,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but might only be waiting until morn-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing to sail away. No one said any-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing about surrender, but even the in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">* domitable skipper could offer no plan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to better our situation. We fell asleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last in anything but an optimistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame of mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Losing sleep through a trick at sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try go, as well as my smarting ear, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was awakened from a dead stupor</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time after daybreak by a cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">from O'Donnell. A signal was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed from Kidd's Mauley, he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all of us rushed to the barricade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A thin morning mist still hung over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bay and around the base of Kidd's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mauley, but not so thick that we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not see the hazy outlines of the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It lay at anchor in the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bay, almost directly to eastward of us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And there, on the northern side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peak to southward and at a point near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top, was a buccaneer holding aloft</seg><seg type="columnLine">the burnished bottom of a pannikin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This he moved back and forth, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposing it to the sun, now swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A ship--or canoes," said Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">George. "See there?

They were heading al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most directly toward me on a course</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, I judged, would bring them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beach in Cannibal Cove, an inden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation in the coast-line between Kidd's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mauley and Middle Point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I ran to the edge of the bluff and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted my news to the captain.

Here we could no longer ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain a clear view of them, for the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tervening trees at the shore line; but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they moved in out of our sight, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">estimated that at least sixty warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprised the party. And from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe we saw them remove three</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound prisoners, while from another</seg><seg type="columnLine">we watched them carry something</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we took to be a wooden idol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Vun t'ing," said the skipper, lower-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the glass, "I can't make out a sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a gun among 'em.

Thereafter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, we proceeded cautiously, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was over an hour before we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked our way to some thickets on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a promontory overlooking their fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could not forget the sight we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">We could see them clearly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">looked upon then. They were not over</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty yards away, and we could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">them clearly. Some were squatting</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a great fire; some were dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gamboling up and down the beach,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some were busy with great kettles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sacks of provender, mixing up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stew. Two of them came lugging a</seg><seg type="columnLine">goatskin gourd of water from a nearby</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring; and still another pair were im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paling a great turtle with their spears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were physical giants, like all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest; indeed, there was not a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them under six feet in height.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we had estimated, there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">over sixty, at the least counting--sixty</seg><seg type="columnLine">great, bronzed warriors, naked save</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a fringed girdle of monkey skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn round the waist. With one ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ception, they were almost identical in</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress. Save for him whom we soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceived to be the chief, each man</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore a shining band of yellow metal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we took at first to be brass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his right ankle. Another was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened around the left wrist. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heads were shaved, or plucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">bald, save for a two-inch ridge running</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the brow to a point at the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the head, and just below the ears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This ridge of stiffened hair rose like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tuft on a Roman helmet, and on a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">line at the middle of the skull. All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors also wore an amulet of boar's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tusks around the neck; and since these</seg><seg type="columnLine">varied in number, I supposed them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be decorations for valorous deeds in</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle. A great number wore rings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow metal through their ear lobes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nostrils, but this seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">optional. Every man but the chief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, had a red circle painted on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chief was a man who would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have drawn attention anywhere. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was easily seven feet in height. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore metal bands on both wrists and</seg><seg type="columnLine">both ankles, and another about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. But if he had worn no insig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nia whatever, one would have marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him instantly. Where most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others were laughing and displaying</seg><seg type="columnLine">their rows of beautiful white teeth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this man's cadaverous features were</seg><seg type="columnLine">as immobile as a mask. He sat apart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a dais covered with skin, his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">planted on a jaguar hide, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce, gloomy eyes burning like two</seg><seg type="columnLine">points of light deep back in dark cav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernous sockets, as solemn and forbid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ding a figure as that of the wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">idol, which was placed on another</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaguar hide under a nearby palm tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This idol, which was about eight feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">high and evidently hollow--since they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had carried it easily up the beach--</seg><seg type="columnLine">was presented to us in profile. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">features were menacing in the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treme; what it resembled I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly tell, as its nose was like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beak of an eagle, and its temples were</seg><seg type="columnLine">adorned with mountain goat's horns;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but its arms were human in shape and</seg><seg type="columnLine">folded across its breast. The whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">was painted in every glaring color of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rainbow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These things we noted, of course, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glance. We also noted that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no guns of any description in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight; no weapons, in fact, save bows</seg><seg type="columnLine">and arrows, long, shovel-bladed spears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">short darts, and shields covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched hide, with some heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadswords, at least five feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length and four inches wide. Like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears, the blades appeared to be made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hammered bronze, while the handles</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wooden and allowed a two</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed grip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cut a bull in two with one swipe,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Donnell whispered to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I merely nodded, for my eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">now fastened on the poor naked pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oners. There were not only two;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were a dozen, all seated or lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a little circle not far from the idol.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were smaller in stature than</seg><seg type="columnLine">their captors; neither were they so</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DEVILS CALDRON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">prepossessing in appearance, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">darker skins and broader nostrils; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite their repulsive, monkey-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">features, their plight filled my heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">with pity. Time and again my eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">come back to them--drawn, I suppose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by an irresistible, morbid fascination.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Which one of them, I thought, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be first to feel the executioner's stroke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Captain," I whispered, "let's save</seg><seg type="columnLine">those poor devils.

A little group moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside just them, we saw two butchers</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy with knives on a prisoner's dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. As they dismembered it, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts were handed to others, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed them into the pots.

But the bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">captive was forced down to a position</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his knees, one strapping warrior</seg><seg type="columnLine">seizing him by the thick, black hair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pulling the head forward, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, while another poised at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, ready with a two-handed sword.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For God's sake, Captain!" whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered O'Donnell.

It came to an abrupt end, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very middle of a note. The chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly shouted, and from his war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors burst another chant--this time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">short and sharp and unutterably sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Ha-ee!

Then, suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief arose, held up his hand, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all rose with him, while the swords-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man raised his weapon and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for the stroke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, oh, oh!" wailed the bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before the sword could fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came a cry from a savage on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our left, and from all the warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came a cry of amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Anthony Wayne was winging</seg><seg type="columnLine">her way out of Drake's Bay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEW ALLIES--AND ENEMIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">| HEN sighted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">schooner had</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded the south-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern end of Kidd's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mauley and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">steering due north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">west on a course to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring her close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entrance of Cannibal Cove.

Some shouted incoherently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with outflung hand pointing toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship; some started running along</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore to westward, and others started</seg><seg type="columnLine">racing down the broad, gently sloping</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach to where the canoes had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn up on shore about one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards below the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the chief brought his followers</seg><seg type="columnLine">to heel in short order. Doubtless it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was instantly obvious to him that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not hope to outsail this great</seg><seg type="columnLine">winged craft, and he knew at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he stood the better chance on</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore, if the stranger was to prove an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy. Wheeling about, he gave one</seg><seg type="columnLine">great booming shout which halted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men dead in their tracks. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce sweep of his arm he then bec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">koned them back; and, pointing toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire, he stalked toward it and sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down once more on his dais--but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time facing the approaching ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment all his men were mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward him; even the execution-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers left their prisoner to fall forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the feet of the hideous idol. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">group after group came up and stop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped, facing to seaward behind their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">chief, he was soon shut off from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was the opportunity for which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Van Tassel had been waiting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The savages were now bunched and</seg><seg type="columnLine">between us and their fire, and, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">things might have turned out far dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferently had we waited to ascertain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gentry's intentions, we were agreed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward, that the skipper was not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be censured for his decision. The ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still over a mile away, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages might separate at any minute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shteady, now!" the captain whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered.

Some pressed our hands against</seg><seg type="columnLine">their cheeks; some sought to embrace</seg><seg type="columnLine">us; others flung themselves on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands and clasped our ankles in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecstasy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indeed, if we had thought them re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsive before, it was marvelous how</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholesome and pleasing their eloquent</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenances were now. Furthermore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was plain that we had rescued any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing but cowards. They were mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cled like gorillas; one of them, by way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of demonstration, picked up a spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drove the point a full eight inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a tree from a distance of thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. Eagerly they pointed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place where their enemies had disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared, making the most savage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimaces and begging us with eloquent</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestures to follow and annihilate them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the captain shook his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowned, and pointed toward the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching ship, they were at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly puzzled and disappointed. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trice another incident set them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">redoubling their pleas. One of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran suddenly to the idol, spat upon it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chopped the face with his sword, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked it over. There, on the jaguar</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin, lay the head of the slain victim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jt had been thrust through the idol's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaping mouth as a sort of offering, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose. With a cry to pierce the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, the savage picked up the head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutching it to his breast and sobbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though his heart were broken;</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereupon his comrades, crying out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sympathy and rage, ran pell-mell</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the fallen warriors near the fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a jiffy they had beheaded every one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead and wounded alike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor was this all. Before we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet them, they rushed upon the idol,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried it to the fire, set it up at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge, and fed every head through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. Then they pushed the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther into the blaze and threw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">king's dais after it. Following this--</seg><seg type="columnLine">which seemed to satisfy them mightily</seg><seg type="columnLine">--they pointed at the pots and by un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistakable signs of nausea made it</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain to us that they were not caters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of human flesh. Then, making it plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they wished to bury their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead comrade, and receiving permis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion from the captain, they fell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scooping out a grave in the sands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this while there was not a sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the other savages, though now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and again we saw movements and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew they were watching us from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant trees.

Heaving to at a point</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite the spot where the cannibals</seg><seg type="columnLine">had disappeared, he then put a boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, and, with six men at the oars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled in toward the shore. Within</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundred yards or so from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach he stopped, and then he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in the sheets and held out his open</seg><seg type="columnLine">palms in token of peace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not a man of us stirred; not a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke at first.

We had been balked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our attempt to capture the canoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had also made a new horde of en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">emies; Gentry, fully cognizant of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation, was now bent on making</seg><seg type="columnLine">these enemies his allies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time there was no response</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the green depths of the woods.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Growing impatient at last, Gentry then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned his boat back toward the An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thony Wayne. In a brace of shakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poor savage, whom they had cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured, was handed down into the gig.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was now tied hand and foot, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gentry, pulling back to his former</seg><seg type="columnLine">position, off the beach, stood up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheets and indicated his purpose with</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmistakable gestures. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly willing to give up the victim to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fiendish captors to gain their</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendship and aid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time the response was forth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming.

But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain, pointing at our muskets, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then at the arms borne by the men in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat, shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Vun t'ing is diss," he said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle George: "olt Skull Face has a</seg><seg type="columnLine">score against us unt propaply he helps</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chentry now.

Drake's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bay not only afforded the best anchor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age, but it brought him closest to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">falls; and, with his new allies, his pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pects for gaining his object seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been brightened immeasurably.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the meantime we were agreed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be folly for us to attack them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their present position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us hope they do attack!" cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">the judge.

He had lain all</seg><seg type="columnLine">night at the foot of the slope, writh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in pain, and there the judge had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found him.

Now-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't talk," said my uncle, kindly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You must save your strength."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I've got to say I'd give a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal to show you what I feels," Gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derson persisted.

"Why, he'd eat some o' that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hisself, sir, to gain an end, he would!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Few of us gave him much chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">for recovery; the man had been shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean through, and he was now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">color of wax. But we had not rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">koned with our new friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as they entered the cavern,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain had bade them set down</seg><seg type="columnLine">their sacks of provender and fall to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating. For this they were humbly</seg><seg type="columnLine">grateful, and, running to the brook</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drinking like men who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling on a desert, they opened one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sacks. This contained parched</seg><seg type="columnLine">corn, sweet potatoes, a sort of pern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mican, thick corn cakes, bunches of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dried grapes, dried fish, and vegetables</seg><seg type="columnLine">which resembled carrots and our on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ions. As we found by tasting, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">food was palatable enough, save that</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of it lacked the salt to which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were accustomed. Our savages downed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with gusto. They were also delighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the bits of cheese, jerked beef</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ship's biscuit which we gave them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sample.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, while they were eating, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick eyes were taking in everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the place; and when the captain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by means of signs, told them that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rations they saw before them were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had to subsist on, they made eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">motions to assure us we need not</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry on that score. As soon as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had finished eating, four of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up bows and arrows, pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly at the woods and, at the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain's nod, went over the barricade in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bound. Two others, noting our shat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered clay pots, ran to the patch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clay at the back of the cavern and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after getting permission from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper, fell to shaping new utensils.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And others, going to our wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, pointed first to the wounds, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the forest, and then back at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, signifying that they would soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">concoct remedies to ease them of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Being given permission to go, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned shortly with some black gum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like tar, and a collection of herbs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm leaves, as well as strips of bark</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some bright red berries.

One of them, in the interim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heated the black gum in a pannikin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While the stuff was still bubbling, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">dipped it up on wooden paddles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smeared it over the wounds, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they bound up the patients with</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm leaves and strips of inner bark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing a dexterity and tenderness</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was admirable to behold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During these ministrations not a pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tient so much as moved.

Moreover, not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them awakened till the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, when all appeared wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully refreshed and declared that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt nothing but a rather pleasant itch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sensation around the surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their wounds. Even Gunderson said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he believed he could now sit up--</seg><seg type="columnLine">though,of course,he was not allowed to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor was this all. The hunters, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meantime, returned with two wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">hogs and a small deer. These were</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedily cut up, and hung on poles</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the fire to smoke. Others brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">back turtle's eggs, breadfruit, mangoes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">luscious wild grapes, more clams, coco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nuts, and some tender vegetables which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they called bago, resembling long rad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishes. All these things they brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">in with an air of childish pride, look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to us like so many eager dogs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting to be patted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why," said my uncle, "if we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">left free to forage, we could live here</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of years, with these chaps to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show us the way of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">F ALL my memor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies of that island</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of that day</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the next are</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant. The sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages, who called</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves Usagos,</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved excellent cooks, in their own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">way of doing. With a bit of coaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">they rapidly picked up our own ideas</seg><seg type="columnLine">of preparing food. So we feasted like</seg><seg type="columnLine">kings and added enough stores on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second day to keep us a matter of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks or more. Moreover, we found</seg><seg type="columnLine">our allies as interesting to watch as so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many quick and eager monkies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They manifested the keenest of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest in everything we had, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughable to see them wondering and</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaiming over a watch or noting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">play of a compass needle when settling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was also something to see when</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them filled a pipe, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Donnell loaned him, and made wry</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces, signifying that the tobacco had</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned his tongue; yet the same man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon after, came in with some dried</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown fluff, resembling that which our</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians call kinnikinick, rolled it in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow palm leaf and smoked away</seg><seg type="columnLine">contentedly. They also found and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chewed a sort of black, tender nut,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they took from a green husk</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that of a walnut; and, though we</seg><seg type="columnLine">found them very bitter to the taste,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Usagos preferred them to samples</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our own "natural twist."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We made slow work at first of pick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up their guttural jargon, save the</seg><seg type="columnLine">names of objects, such as bogo, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword, and bees, for spear; but by</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding up objects, making signs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing diagrams in the sand we came</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last to a fair understanding. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">.were worshippers of the sun and lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">on an island two days' travel to west-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward by canoe with fair, direct winds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their enemies, whom they called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buscas, lived on another island to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">iiorth and west, and about the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance. For these Buscas they ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed the deepest hatred and loath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, yet they declared that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not afraid of them. Their own cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture they explained by illustrating in</seg><seg type="columnLine">pantomime. They had been hunting;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had fallen asleep, after a hearty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feast, and, being only twenty in num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber, had been surprised by as many as</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first they could not understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">why we had come to the island. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing shown a gold coin, they were im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately intrigued with the bas-relief</seg><seg type="columnLine">portrait and the lettering thereon; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was plain that they did not recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nize it as a thing of value. Holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">up their wrists and ankles, they showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they had worn ornaments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same metal. This, they indicated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had taken from streams on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">island in nuggets and had shaped it</seg><seg type="columnLine">for mere ornamentation. Then, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they grasped the fact that we had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped to take many such coins from</seg><seg type="columnLine">this island and in pantomime had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown what one such coin would pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chase, one of them took my uncle by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pointing toward the west, he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few steps with Uncle George. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he paused and threw his arms wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though to clasp my uncle to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bosom. Following this gesture, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took off my uncle's hat, held out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand for the coin, dropped it into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat, and made a motion as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaping it full. And, picking up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pebble somewhat of the same color,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie pretended to fill the hat over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, thrusting it each time toward my</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle's hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Plain enough!" cried my uncle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If we will go with them, they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">load us down with nuggets."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But here he shrugged helplessly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed westward, laughed, and flap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped his arms like a bird flying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Usago understood, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed in answer and, picking up one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our axes, showed with this, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough picture on the sand, how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his fellows would shape a dugout</seg><seg type="columnLine">if a tree large enough could be found.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This heartened us mightily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why," cried O'Donnell, "in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways I'd as soon hide out till them</seg><seg type="columnLine">swabs puts to sea. Them pirates and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannibals, I means. What's gold to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead man, anyway, I says? Let 'an</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the swag, and we try for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other island."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not much use hiding, if they take</seg><seg type="columnLine">pains to find us," said Uncle George.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, by Jophet! I have a feeling that</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow, someway, we'll do them yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get the ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When we showed the Usagos the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chart of the island, they were at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a loss to know what to make of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But when we pointed out Drake's Bay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the peninsulas they had seen com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in, they understood. With many</seg><seg type="columnLine">shakes of the head, they pointed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lake, making signs to show that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water leaped up in fountains now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again while the earth trembled all</seg><seg type="columnLine">round it. We took this to mean that</seg><seg type="columnLine">volcanic disturbances occurred at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom on occasion, with earthquake</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremors, and concluded that the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not inhabited because the savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed it to be cursed by evil spirits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime, we took turns watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cannibal Cove from the bluff by day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and maintained a vigilant guard at</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Occasionally we could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gig going and coming from the ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while groups of cannibals staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">into view now and then, plainly drunk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">34</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FRONTIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I go down und get a look," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain, on the second morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Maype, if all is drunk, ve surbrise</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em some."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing we could say would dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suade him from the risk, so he and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle set out. But they returned with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hour, saying that, drunk or not,</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Skull Face maintained discipline.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But on that same day we made two</seg><seg type="columnLine">important discoveries. The bluff face</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the mouth of our cave, it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be remembered, rose perpendicularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fifty feet or more. At the top a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge overhung several feet. O'Don-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nell, who was aloft with a telescope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was moving about to stretch his legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walked to the edge. A cracked</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragment on which he stepped began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to teeter with his weight, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped back just in time. The great</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone, weighing several tons, rocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little, then settled back into place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thereupon O'Donnell reported to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper; a stout pole was cut and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken up, and it was found that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">man could easily tip the slab over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ha!" chuckled the skipper. "Vot</seg><seg type="columnLine">a surbrise dey get now if dey attack."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he looked below at the spot where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slab would probably strike. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fairly in front of the cavern</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I made the other discovery. Chanc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to look behind a huge rock at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the cavern, I found that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered a hole. We rolled the rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, and exploration disclosed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that we had unearthed a natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel. There were some tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeezes here and there, but no by-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passages ; and it wound on, and slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward to an exit on the west side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knoll, some three hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the cavern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It vill help us scouting ven dey t'ink</seg><seg type="columnLine">ve're cooped," said the skipper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime the Anthony Wayne did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not move until noon observation. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she weighed anchor and, with the can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oes trailing, came sailing round Kidd's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mauley once more and up to a posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion opposite our cavern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I SCOUT FOR TREASURE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">before the An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">y Wayne let</seg><seg type="columnLine">her anchor --</seg><seg type="columnLine">h was at about</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock, or four</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--	a warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle, aloft on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluff, had brought in our last foragers,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and all was made ready for an attack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My uncle remained on the bluff; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain took the first watch at the bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ricade ; and the rest of us, in two par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties, stood ready behind the walls on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side of the breastworks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My party, which included five of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Usagos and O'Donnell, took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right side; the judge and Killifer, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisted they were quite able to fight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on the left with the remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">six allies. Johannsen and Gunderson</seg><seg type="columnLine">were placed behind them, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johannsen grumbled audibly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swore he would be into it, leg or no</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg, if they succeeded in boarding us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But almost immediately we con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded that Gentry did not contemplate</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediate hostilities. The cannibals</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up the bay shouting drunkenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at their paddles and beached to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">northeast of us behind the trees. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">few of them came to the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest to shout at us; one planted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear at the foot of the slope, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of their last victim upon it; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they soon had a fire going and could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be heard chanting and gibbering in</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunken abandon. Then, too, a gig</seg><seg type="columnLine">put off from the ship. Gentry, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Busca chief, two of his cannibals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dumphey, and three sailors were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and they were headed up toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river's mouth, to northward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was then that I made a mad pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posal. It seemed reasonable to believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there would be no attack with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two chieftains away, and I was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how certain that their trip had to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the treasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're headed up to the waterfall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll wager," I argued. "Probably to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make plans for the treasure's removal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">,They feel sure they have us bottled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. But why not let me spy on them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and learn what I can?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first the skipper frowned. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed a mad risk; he did not want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">expose me unnecessarily, nor weaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">our party. But, I pointed out, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">an excellent chance to slip out behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knoll through the tunnel; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buscas were in all probability watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the front of the cave, thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had no other outlet; and I was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good runner, and enough of a woods-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to take full advantage of cover.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last he yielded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I vouln't do it," he said, patting</seg><seg type="columnLine">me awkwardly on the shoulder, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion of moisture in his eyes, "only</seg><seg type="columnLine">--I haf a feeling you come back. Und</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gott go mit you--jess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as I had expected, there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no signs of the Buscas when I emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the tunnel. .The knoll was now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">between me and them, and I ran down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slope to westward and plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the trees. There, safely hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their view, I turned northward</seg><seg type="columnLine">till I ran into the trail we had so re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cently cut and headed westward again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">intent on mounting the plateau.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the sake of lightness I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken only a musket, a pistol, a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass, and a few ship's biscuits. So I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made rapid progress and within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour was at the top of the plateau.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From there I had little trouble in</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching the falls. There were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">vines to hinder me here; the footing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was good, and the thunder of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumbling waters served as a guide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For caution's sake, I proceeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully when I neared the falls; for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I reasoned that, if they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming here, they would not hurry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I had done, there was always the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance that I had miscalculated. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">chart showed a great bend in the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the falls and the mouth; ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cording to this they had much the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater distance to travel; yet I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no means of knowing how far they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be able to row against the cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent, nor whether Gentry knew of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorter route and a less precipitate</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope to mount. But I reached my</seg><seg type="columnLine">destination without mishap; to all ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearances I was alone upon the pla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teau.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was brought up standing the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant I came within view of the brink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE river, at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">point, was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty feet wide. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brink and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tending up-stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a rocky projec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. It was shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion of a ship, turned keel up, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bows heading up-stream. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">acted as a delta, splitting the stream in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two. In length the projection was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">over fifty feet, while the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge rose ten or twelve feet above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water; and it was approximately but</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten feet through at the thickest part,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that the channel on the north side</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about ten feet wide, and that on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south--the side on which I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing--something near ten yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">in width. Splitting at the beak of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">delta, the blue waters raced through</seg><seg type="columnLine">these channels pell-mell, plunging on</seg><seg type="columnLine">and downward over the brink in two</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct falls to the rocks some seventy</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, this in itself was nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvel at; but there, on the northern</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DEVIL S CALDRON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bank, where the pines grew in a thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall down close to the water, I saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great gap. There was an indentation</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bank opposite the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">delta which had never been made by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water; and there were the stumps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of several trees close by, with the ax</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks, weather-beaten as they were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still plain upon them. But not a fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunk remained in sight. Why they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been cut down, where they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been taken to, and why they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut in this particular spot I could in no</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise imagine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor was this all. Just opposite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">up-stream end of the projection, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">south bank, and about fifteen feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the edge of the channel, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluff. Well, in this low bluff, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not over twenty feet high, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one had caused a sort of grotto to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">hewed from the rocks. In this grotto</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a wooden idol. It had been carved</seg><seg type="columnLine">from blackest ebony, was about eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet high, had a great hooked beak for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nose, and showed a great, ugly</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, with the lips curled back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth which had been made from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner surface of shells. I almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped when I looked at the eyes; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were formed of green crystal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembling emerald, and were as bale-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful in expression as those of a lynx</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at one from the dark depths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cavern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the bright, golden sunlight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, which caused those green</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths to sparkle so; yet the effect was</seg><seg type="columnLine">most uncanny. Wherever one moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the arc before it the eyes of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous monster seemed to follow--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I could even imagine that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a hint of sardonic mirth in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible orbs as the idol, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatted upon a carved dais, sat there</seg><seg type="columnLine">with grimly folded arms and watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">me move about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the feet of the thing was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">cone of human skulls, four in number,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a spear, a bow, a quiver of ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows, and a shield made of hide. These,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the appearance, had been there a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time. And behind the idol lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">more weapons and more skulls. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lain there for a much longer pe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riod, I judged, than the others, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the quivers were rotten with</seg><seg type="columnLine">age.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So struck was I by these sights that</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment I forgot my mission.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But presently I was startled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raucous screaming of a red-billed bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">below me; and as it soared away over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees, I crept close to the brink and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered below. Here and there I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">where steps had been hewn from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rock; and at a point about half-way</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the steep slope, where the trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">were thick, and on my side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">falls, I caught the gleam of a musket</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was 110 time for indecision.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had guessed true; the buccaneers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were coming to the falls. Now I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">either run or stay to see whatever was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to happen. Having come thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">far, I elected to stay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The face of the little bluff ran sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the brink of the falls. This left a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat beach, about fifteen feet wide, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween it and the water. If the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief and the buccaneers followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of the steps, after emerging from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees--and this seemed likely--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoned that they would emerge on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this beach. Hence I had two choices:</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hide behind the idol, or mount the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluff from its footslope to westward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A hump back of the grotto would hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">me from their view as they came up;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there were also thickets close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge to shield me when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the beach. So I selected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluff and in a brace of shakes was hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing behind the thickets a little to west-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward of the idol and some ten feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">above it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVIH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">,&lt; jerry Blunt's cache</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAD not long to'</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait before Gentry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the big chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">made an unforget-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table picture as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">topped the rise--■</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief a golden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skinned statue, quite naked save for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his girdle and ornaments, and Gentry</seg><seg type="columnLine">all decked out with a yellow silk shirt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bright red head scarf, and a blue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-white polka-dotted sash around</seg><seg type="columnLine">his waist. I have yet to look upon two</seg><seg type="columnLine">better specimens of physical develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. The chief topped Gentry by</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a head, and Gentry was a full six</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches over six feet in height. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">big savage was also scarred about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast, with bony features as devoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of warmth as that of a grinning skull;</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet, of the two, I had much rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">have faced the cannibal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gentry's shirt was open at the neck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposing a scarred and tattooed breast</seg><seg type="columnLine">that reminded me of joined shields;</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sleeves were rolled up to the el-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows, showing his great forearms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with corded muscles as thick as a ship's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hawser; and now, as he dashed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat from his hammered features,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and twisted his eyebrows up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil's horns, glaring quickly about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the while, I was sure that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never looked upon a more formidable</seg><seg type="columnLine">villain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After one glance at the idol, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief saluted with a quick bend of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knee, both went to the river's edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lay down for a deep drink. Dum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phey, Horn, two other sailors, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two cannibals followed one another up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steps a moment later, and they,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, hurried forward for a draught of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sparkling water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now I was treated to an agree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able surprise. I had feared that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of the falls would bother me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing them speak, but at the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">word this fear vanished. With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">close growth of the trees on every</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, I found that the acoustics were</seg><seg type="columnLine">such that I heard them easily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah 1" growled Gentry, standing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and resting his great right hand on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">butt of a silver-mounted pistol in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sash. "That's better nor brandy, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. How about it, old Marble Face?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he looked at the chief and rubbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his belly, with a little smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chief did not return the smile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he grunted, "Huh!" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded. Then, with a look of fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride, he pointed at the statue, or idol,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thence back to the river, and again at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the delta. Kneeling down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he drew something in the sand, crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wrists before him, made a motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though binding them, pointed again</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the stream, made a sweeping mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with his arm toward the falls, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then pointed once more at the up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream prow of the delta. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood back and folded his arms dra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matically,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's he powwowing about?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Dumphey, coming up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why," said Gentry, who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodding understanding^ through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief's demonstration, "here's the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, I take it.

The man's one good eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">was burning in his head, and he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">all round about him eagerly. "Where's</seg><seg type="columnLine">that blunt, is what I wants to know."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Stow that!" Gentry snapped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who are you, Tom Blake, shovin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself forward so brash?

Sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral bullets whistled perilously close,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but these only served to increase my</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, and, as they had all been drink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing heavily, I had soon left them in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BARNABY REVOLTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EELING assured of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this at last I</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush for a brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing spell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I had been ly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing there but a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment or two, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to me, when I heard the thump</seg><seg type="columnLine">of heavy .feet just above me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone breasting a thicket.

The third shot whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through just above the barricade, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wail like a lost soul. It struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall at the rear of the cave with a tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous crash, knocking down a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shower of rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the same space of time several</seg><seg type="columnLine">musket balls chugged into the logs be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore us, and others ripped viciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the leather shields. Nor were</seg><seg type="columnLine">they without effect. I heard the judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry out sharply, while the Usago be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side me clapped a hand to his cheek</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brought it away streaming with</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In that brief instant we might well</seg><seg type="columnLine">have lost the fight. Bedlam reigned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The reports of the long nines were re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoing back and forth between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluff and the ridge on Blackbeard's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boot; the kettle drums were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounded by madmen; and what with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrifying howls of the cannon</seg><seg type="columnLine">balls, the vicious spat of the slugs</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the muskets, and the bloodthirsty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yells from the cannibals, we were in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair way toward being stampeded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shteady!" roared the skipper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All hands up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly I was as cool as ice, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think, my shipmates were similarly</seg><seg type="columnLine">affected by the captain's coolness. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannibals were coming on in bounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">up that steep slope; the buccaneers</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired again and again from the edge of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The rock came crashing down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees till their allies spread out</seg><seg type="columnLine">across their line of fire; then they, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped out on their own account, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying cutlases and shouting wildly;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not a one of my shipmates fired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All waited for the word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime our Usagos were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not inactive. They were firing arrows</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the pack with a rapidity that</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed me. They snatched an arrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the quiver before them, fitted it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the string, drew it back till the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the bow, fired, and reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">for another arrow, all in one contin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uous motion. And their marksman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was amazing, too. The cannibals</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not come twenty yards from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees when I saw one pluck at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast and fall, and others were sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicking and howling to the ground as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came on. But still they contin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ued to come, a howling horde of</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunken devils, with their gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief raging like a madman at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HEN, when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a full half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way up the slope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skipper barked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the order to fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The effect of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadside could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have l&gt;een bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered. At least five went down, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, struck by the scattering bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot, screamed and faltered. Immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately we were pouring lead into them</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the remaining muskets, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">man firing as fast as he could pick up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gun and aim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, to add to their confusion, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth cannon aboardship roared, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ball struck fair in the midst of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickest part of their line, not thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards from the barricade. At least</seg><seg type="columnLine">two must have been killed instantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while several more were struck by fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rocks or blinded by the shower of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This catastrophe must have taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart out of a full third of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Screaming with fright, they scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to right and left or started running for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lives toward the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When this happened some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foremost, with the chief among them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were within five yards of us. ] lis fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowers, who had converged, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">charging in behind, strung out over</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten yards or more of ground.

But this, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cannon shot fired into their backs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a volley of arrows and pistol balls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent another score howling back down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">40</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FRONTIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had but a heart-beat in which to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize this when the big chief and</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight or nine more were leaping up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barricade upon us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In spite of our previous luck, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate, in that instant, hung perilously</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the wrong side of the scales.</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Donnell was writhing on the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a spear through his breast. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Usagos were dead; the judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been wounded with a musket ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the left arm; and while our en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">emies swarmed up the breastworks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gentry and his buccaneers were half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way up the hill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My heart, as the saying goes, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to lead. A second before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been firing behind cover; now we</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to grips in a raging, howling</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurly-burly of shots, cries, screams,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clashing steel, with reinforcements</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the enemy coming up to make an</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had we fallen back, had we wav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered an instant, all would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost. But above all that infernal roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a desperate bellow from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper which turned the tide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Charge 'em!" he yelled, as the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief mounted the barricade; and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly, for all his weight, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped upon the breastworks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chopped down the nearest enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This acted powerfully upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Usagos, who had abandoned their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows and arrows for swords or spears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a wild yell they bounded up after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skipper; and the rest of us, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistols and cutlases, were after them</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big chief hung poised above me</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I lunged. His spear was drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">liack for a thrust that would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">pierced me through and through. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol ball, fired with the left hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck him full in the breast. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered, but I fended his spear just</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time with my cutlas, for with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">last spasm he lunged forward. Down</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came tumbling, like a big bullock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I used him for a step to mount</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barricade. As I did so O'Donnell</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered part way up, fired a pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his last gasp, and struck the can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nibal before me in the leg. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">howled and pitched backward to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. Horn, scrambling up beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, was knocked down by a brute with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a two-handed sword; but a Usago fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished the cannibal with a ripping spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust from below. In the next heart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat four more went down--one with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cavern, two on the breastwork,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one on the outside. The only remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cannibal turned and ran for his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thunderstruck by this turn of</seg><seg type="columnLine">events, three of the buccaneers also</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and fled. The others halted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertainly, about thirty yards from</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. Gentry raved like a berserker be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore them, with a pistol in one hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a cutlas in the other; but he bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed in vain. Uncle George whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his pistol and sent a ball whistling</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the side of Gentry's yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">silk shirt, and the man behind him</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun crazily and pitched to the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All of the remaining buccaneers, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluding Dumphey, turned and flew for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gentry paused a moment still, shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his cutlas at us. I will long re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member that ugly, distorted visage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the bloody patch on one cheek</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the slash of a mouth set like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaws of a wolf trap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll get you yet!" he roared sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly. "I'll feed every man Jack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to these niggers if I have to stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">here a year!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shifting quickly to dodge a spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown by one of the Ufcagos, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted his pistol and fired both barrels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick as winking; and Uncle George</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted and fell back against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper. Then Gentry turned and ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">back down the hill. We were forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let him go in safety, for my uncle's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot had been our last, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone before we could reload.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quite out of hand for the moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our Usagos now ran out and fell upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wounded cannibals. They had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected no quarter, and they gave none.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of the twenty-three who had fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the barricade, not one was left</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive for more than a minute after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gentry ran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile I ran to my uncle. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that the pistol ball had cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his left breast muscles and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the arm pit. He had also been</seg><seg type="columnLine">gashed in the right side with a spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was bleeding from another cut in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the calf of his left leg. His wounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not necessarily fatal, I could see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he was very pale and no longer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be counted on as a combatant. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge was also painfully wounded for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second time; the bullet had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean through the biceps of his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm, barely missing the bone; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he insisted on helping Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">George back behind the breastworks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fainted dead away as soon as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had set my uncle down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor was this all. Killifer's old</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound had reopened, and he had suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered another gash in the left shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. O'Donnell was stone dead, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were two of the Usagos. A third</seg><seg type="columnLine">Usago, with his skull split, lingered</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some hours but never recovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness. Three of them had</seg><seg type="columnLine">minor wounds, but one had been so</seg><seg type="columnLine">severely wounded in the left arm that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we feared amputation would be nec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">essary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had expected to see Horn lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff as well as O'Donnell; but here I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was agreeably surprised. I found him</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting up behind the barricade, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood flowing from a scalp wound, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more than a little dazed. A dash</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water and a drink of brandy quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him round again. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fended off the cannibal's blow with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutlas, he said, and so only received a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glancing crack, probably with the flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the blade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gunderson, who declared with sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age satisfaction that he had shot at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least one cannibal from his comer, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johannsen, who hobbled down soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward from the cliff, to be greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hearty cheers, had also escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">without further injuries. But there</seg><seg type="columnLine">now remained only the skipper, Horn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself and six of the Usagos who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could l&gt;e counted on as fit combatants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BARN'ABY TAKES A CITANCE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">S A matter of pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caution the skipper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horn and I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaded all the fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Usagos busied</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves caring</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the wounded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But we were not attacked again that</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon, The buccaneers and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannibals remained out of sight lie-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the trees on the beach at the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the opening, and were doubtless</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy enough, as the skipper declared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">picking the bird shot from their hides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, our situation was now ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremely serious. The morrow was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming; and even the skipper agreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we would be hard put to it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">withstand another attack. So, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dusk fell, and the bats came down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a great swarm from their burrows</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Execution Knob, grinning hide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously down at the dead as they flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">slothfully toward the palms, we held</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grim council.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was one hope, we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed, and this lay in the possible de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parture of the cannibals. Their chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dead; nothing but disaster had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen them since they came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island. Moreover, there was the can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">non shot which had been fired into</seg><seg type="columnLine">their backs. We were fairly certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this had been the result of an ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cident or carelessness, but it remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be seen whether or not Gentry</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be able to explain it to the sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If he can explain it," said my</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle, "there'll be a serious how-do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">you-do, and no mistake.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sobbed like children over their</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead; but, pointing to them and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the woods, they signified, by sweep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their hands across their throats</seg><seg type="columnLine">and holding up their fingers, that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped to get at least ten of the canni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bals for each one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Veil," said the skipper at last.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now--what's happened, sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's happened ?" Gentry laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a touch of bitterness in his tones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We tried to lay aboard 'em, Barnaby,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they give us a bastin', that's what."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No!" cried Barnaby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Gentry.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gave Horn a brief outline of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affray. "So now," he continued,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"there's one or two here wants to cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">and run for it. But that's not me, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Flying Dutchman!" He shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great mallet-like fist in the air toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cavern. "I tell you," he cried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"we'll have that blunt now if I has to</seg><seg type="columnLine">haul the long nines ashore to do it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've got these swabs pacified--partly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway--and you see, now, when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gives 'em these guns. Once they know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to use 'em--well, you'll see."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here he clapped Dumphey on the back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">adding, "Drink up, now, and we'll pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceed with the ceremony of presenta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.

You need a</seg><seg type="columnLine">calker, I shouldn't wonder."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do, and no mistake," said Barn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aby, downing his drink; "and, Cap'n,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you don't mind, I'd like for to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard a few minutes.

"What's all this black gum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where'd you get that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got it off a tree," said Barnaby.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My head was that hot, and I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would cool it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You thought, eh?" snorted Gentry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Get yourself aboard ship for a lub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber, Barnaby.

You tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">that nigger aboard to wash this stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, and you'll find a jar of salve on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin table. But be back here with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gig as soon as you get fixed ship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape, mind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, aye, sir," said Barnaby, read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">justing his scarf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes," said Gentry, looking to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the cannibals' fire, "I see their</seg><seg type="columnLine">keg is drained.

But when I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barnaby depart, my heart seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swell to twice its normal size. So far</seg><seg type="columnLine">our mad venture had received the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blessing of Providence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">S SOON as Barn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aby pushed off into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness, Gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try summoned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, and, bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the muskets, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buscas' fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cannibals, falling silent, rose up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their haunches--many stagger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as they did so--and grouped them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves behind the man whom I took to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be their temporary chieftain. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">still were over thirty of them, but sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral of these were bearing minor</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At Gentry's direction the muskets</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stacked before the new chief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the pirate stood back, placed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand on his heart, and waved his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left toward the guns with an eloquent</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The new cannibal leader had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing with his arms folded across</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mighty breast, but even he forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dignity at this and snatched up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">musket with a cry of delight. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, meanwhile, fairly fell over one</seg><seg type="columnLine">another in their eagerness to handle</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new weapons. In a minute they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were laughing, shouting, cocking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces, pulling triggers, and dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">round the buccaneers like frenzied</seg><seg type="columnLine">children.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see?" said Gentry, when their</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DEVIL S CALDRON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">first exuberance had somewhat spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself. "They only about half under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood what the devil was hitting them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wait till they knows how to use them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here the chief stepped up to Gentry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed at the muzzle of his musket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then at one of the buccaneer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder horns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They knows the way of it," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dumphey, with a chuckle. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched us loading."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right you are," said Gentry. "Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, I'll not give them powder horns</seg><seg type="columnLine">--save the chief, maybe--till morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'll be blowing themselves to Jer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">icho. But I'll commence now with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Forthwith he summoned the savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him, took the chief's musket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carefully loaded it for him, point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out each move with powder horn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot, and rammer. He then handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the piece to the cannibal, motioned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest back a pace or two, and showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him how to aim at a nearby palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree which was outlined in the firelight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had I dared I would have laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">hysterically at the figure that cannibal</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut as he aimed. He was the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief; he dared not show his fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">openly; yet he could not control the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling of his hands nor the twitch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of his features. Gentry tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make him understand that he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold the piece tightly against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder to lessen the kick of the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coil, but evidently he did not grasp the</seg><seg type="columnLine">import of it; for, when the gun roared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the butt smashed back against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, slipped, struck his jaw, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost knocked him off his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whereupon he dropped the gun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed his bleeding jaw, and glared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Gentry in mixed fear and rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If one man laughs," said Gentry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiercely, "I'll throw him to the sharks."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shaking his head, then, he picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun, loaded it, and had one man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing to one side, attempt to pull</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun away from his shoulder, to il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lustrate how firmly he held it. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie fired, hitting the tree; and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared the gun for the chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time the cannibal got the hang</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it; and a great cry of delight went</seg><seg type="columnLine">up as he fired and struck the tree on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own account. He puffed out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest and strutted in childish pride</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his exploit; nor was he content</seg><seg type="columnLine">to allow the others to practice until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had loaded and fired three more shots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this while not a sound had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ship. A good half hour went</seg><seg type="columnLine">by before I heard the sound of oar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">locks on the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this juncture the cannibals and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buccaneers were still grouped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north side of the large fire. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had formed a short line between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger group and the trees, with a buc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caneer as instructor for each new rifle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man as they came up in turn. As all</seg><seg type="columnLine">were side-on to me by now and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">well out of the firelight, I arose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped quietly down to the beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I think that in the next half minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so, what with the racing of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, and the chills running up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down my spine, I must have lived a</seg><seg type="columnLine">life time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, when the gig came close in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and still not a sound from Barnaby, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke out with perspiration from every</seg><seg type="columnLine">pore. He had said he would be sing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. It was so dark I could barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">make out the gig as a blotch somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">darker than the night itself; and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not tell whether there was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in it or two. Had Barnaby de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted after all, and was this another</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crew come to give Gentry warn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of my presence?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But still I lingered, for at least I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the beach to run upon, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to be absolutely sure before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved. At all events I was deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined to kill Gentry before leaving,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he stood just to one side, beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new cannibal leader, laughing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesticulating, and now and again offer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the savage his flask. He was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair target in the firelight, and I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I could not miss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gig came to shore not far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, but still there was no sound from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man or men aboard her. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard someone arise and clamber out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a brace of shakes a man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking toward the big fire. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely time to recognize him as Barn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aby as he stepped into the outer edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the firelight, for suddenly he raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">the keg which he was carrying and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled it straight into the fire. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more than struck when Barnaby</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw himself flat, and the very earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocked with a tremendous explosion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">barnaby's bomb</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">O	BAND of villains</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ever treated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a more terrible sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise. The terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of that ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosion threw some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fagots as</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as our cavern,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed one cannibal into the treetops,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">blew others into shreds, and set those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were not knocked down to run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning in all directions like so many jib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bering idiots. Nor were the buccan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eers in any better shape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Barnaby had been on his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the sound of the crash, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">running back to the gig, shouting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Jack!

A thatch of crispy, red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dish brown hair, lightened by alkali</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust and the lack of a barber's atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, covered a well shaped head. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun and dust and wind, together with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a naturally good-humored disposition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had put little nests of permanent</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrinkles at the corners of his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just now, there was a look of serious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness in Clell's gray eyes, as he avoided</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jam and rush of men going into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tent, and waited quietly until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could enter like the gentleman he was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reason for the serious look was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Clell was about to undertake an</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventure of which he could see only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beginning and couldn't even guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end.

I found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, too, and could have bought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim for a song, but by that time I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't sing a note. I was broke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looking for something that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do, to eat. I came down here, think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing I might work my team a while on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grade, but it's no go. I began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cough when I got in a mile of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust. Then I gave up, decided to sell</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wagon and team for enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take me back to the old home, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can at least be buried like a Chris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man stopped and hung his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a despondent manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you sell your team?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. That's what I was doing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foreman's tent.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow that runs some teams on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">job, name's Spradley, offered me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> seventy five dollars for the two horses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I could get rid of the wagon. I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">take it, but that wouldn't get me back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Phoenix, by stage, and buy me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticket home, to say nothing of any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to eat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Qell pondered the problem a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I had enough money, I'd buy</seg><seg type="columnLine">your outfit," he said then.

"You could go</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on Little Bowlegs, then, and get</seg><seg type="columnLine">that claim I told you about. There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a hundred acres that can be put</seg><seg type="columnLine">under water, and there's an ocean of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water in Little Bowlegs. Plenty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">good pasture land adjoining it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody would ever crowd in, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's no more farm land on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creek. Just the place you're looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for. I wouldn't tell you, but I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have it myself. Come, go down to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, and look at the outfit," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marshall rose from his seat on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clell joined him and they walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">away together. The stranger had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribed the very thing that Clell had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been dreaming of for months. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had more than enough money to buy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outfit at a reasonable, fair price,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not enough to do that and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">any operating capital left. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be money to pay the shiftless</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatter something for the claim, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go on until a crop could be raised.</seg><seg type="columnLine">True, he might grind this poor, sick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken-hearted wanderer down, buy</seg><seg type="columnLine">his team for a pittance, and get by</seg><seg type="columnLine">that way. He knew that was one way</seg><seg type="columnLine">men got rich in this world, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">decent character revolted at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they walked away through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, a man got up from behind a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great boulder, within twenty feet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they had been sitting, and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the foreman's tent. It was Buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spradley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A quarter of a mile from the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction camp, they came to Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall's wagon and the two great, raw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boned bay horses. Clell looked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses over the best he could in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fading light, caught the spokes of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon wheel and shook it to see how</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly the thimbles were worn, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then sat down on the wagon tongue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lit his pipe. A scheme was hatch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in his mind, but he wanted Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall to talk more before he decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FRONTIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hasn't the climate done you any</seg><seg type="columnLine">good?" he asked, between puffs at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As long as I could stay up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foothills, like the Bowlegs country, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to mend, but as soon as I come</seg><seg type="columnLine">down where the alkali dust is, it's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wouldn't you like to go back up</seg><seg type="columnLine">there ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd rather l&gt;e there than anywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth, but I can't live on climate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scenery. Buy my outfit, at your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own price. Then go up there and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a fortune. I'd rather have that</seg><seg type="columnLine">little irrigated farm than to have any</seg><seg type="columnLine">mining proposition in the territory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd like to try a lot of things on it that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I learned in my four years in college.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Botany, horticulture, and agriculture</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hobbies of mine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clell smoked in silence. Buying</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses from strangers in Arizona at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time was a doubtful enterprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They might be good horses, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buyer might also be called on by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">party of enraged citizens, who knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">but one remedy for horse stealing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried it with them, coiled at a sad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle horn. Marshall didn't look like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thief, nor did he talk like a receiver</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stolen goods; still, Clell was cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I won't buy your team," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last. "I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, for pity sake, man!" cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marshall, with almost a sob in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. "I'll take any price you say,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	can't work and I don't want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">starve. This West they tell about is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great place, and the people are all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. The proportion of good and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad is about the same as in other</seg><seg type="columnLine">places--except in railroad camps--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the West is too busy to take care</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cripples.

You'll know I'm all right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or I wouldn't make the offer, and I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">know you're game, if you take me up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good enough!

Thus making an isosceles</seg><seg type="columnLine">triangle, with a twenty-five mile base</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the claim on Little Bowlegs at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apex.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">              HREE days later,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">              the wagon, well</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">              stocked with sup-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">              plies and grain for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">              the team, the part-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">              ners topped a rise,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">              and Marshall, who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">              was driving, stop-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">              ped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yonder," said he, "is Bowlegs</seg><seg type="columnLine">Creek. There are two of them, Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowlegs and Little Bowlegs. Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowlegs is dry, except when it rains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which isn't often. Little Bowlegs has</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flood of water, from head springs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the time. You see that the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">streams head almost together, curve</seg><seg type="columnLine">out like a parenthesis and come to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether again.

Old Gray Hoss Riley's up</seg><seg type="columnLine">there--or was, last time I seen him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's been there five year, and raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">one good crop."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mosby rattled on until the partners</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished eating. Afterward, Marshall</seg><seg type="columnLine">got out his violin and blended its music</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that of the gurgling stream. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a dreamer and a rare musician.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Next morning the partners were</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened by the rattle of Mosby's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon, as he broke camp a little after</seg><seg type="columnLine">daylight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't like to give this Bowlegs</seg><seg type="columnLine">project up," said Marshall, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast. "If Mosby told the truth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spradley will be wanting to sell pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon. Suppose we take a little trip up</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Bowlegs and get the lay of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. No use trying to trade with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spradley now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Might as well, now that we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">here," replied Clell. "I don't want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see Buck Spradley. There's pretty apt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be trouble whenever and wherever</seg><seg type="columnLine">we meet. He's a good man, I reckon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I can't get along with him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They hitched up the team and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dim road that led up Big Bowlegs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ten miles from their camp, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged from the boulder-strewn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wilderness into a beautiful valley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walled alxmt with foothills. The creek</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran almost due south from the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains, and the valley lay on the east side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. As Mosby said, there was two or</seg><seg type="columnLine">three hundred acres of fine land, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">no water. There were two cabins in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight, and a wreath of .smoke was curl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the chimney of one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Gray Hoss Riley was standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the door of the first cabin they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Riley was standing in the door</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">came to, and the old gray bag o' bones</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gave him his name was grazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stunted bunch grass near the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mawnin', gents, called the old hob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">goblin, as the wagon stopped, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tobacco-stained whiskers bobbing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down and giving the appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an ancient billy goat. "Prospectin',</seg><seg type="columnLine">I reck'n," he went on, when they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned his greeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thought we might locate a claim</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this section, if we could find a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">one," ventured Clell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ain't but three claims in twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile that's worth the filin' fee, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they're all took.

He swore</seg><seg type="columnLine">and protested that the offer was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">insult, but within an hour he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred dollars which was more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have given for the whole of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arizona, and the partners had a quit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim deed, written by Marshall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">duly signed, together with the original</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers issued by the land office. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">title wasn't much as it stood, but if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they made certain payments and did</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain things within a specified time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be perfect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They took possession of the cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Marshall began to figure. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was figuring forty bales of alfalfa to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the load, and a ready market at $1.50</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bale, at the railroad. He took no</seg><seg type="columnLine">account of the fact that,when the rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road was built, alfalfa would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipped in cheaper than that. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst of his figuring, while Clell was</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently trying to figure out why he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought the claim, Old Gray Hoss hob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled up to the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Howdy, gents. Been thinkin' about</seg><seg type="columnLine">these claims. You'd orter have one</seg><seg type="columnLine">apiece. I'm getting pretty old, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd sell out entire, if I got the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, Clell was putting up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money for the enterprise, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been wondering why he had paid a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred for a dry claim, where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">never rained. Neither of the partners</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell you what I'll do," Mr. Riley</seg><seg type="columnLine">went 011. "You seem a likely pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngsters, that's apt to make some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of this valley. I'm too old to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work it. I'll sell you the other claim</seg><seg type="columnLine">for another hundred."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No." said Clell, "if it's any good</seg><seg type="columnLine">one claim is enough. If it isn't any</seg><seg type="columnLine">good, one claim is too much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Mr. Riley was no quitter, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had set his hand to the plow. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down to seventy-five, then to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty, and finally offered to take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winchester rifle and twenty-five dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars, and leave the valley. More for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the riddance than for the land, Clell</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the trade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon after noon, Mr. Riley packed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his most intimate belongings on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old gray plug and disappeared into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roughs at the south end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley. He had bumped two suckers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was not the first time he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done the like with those same two</seg><seg type="columnLine">claims.</seg><seg type="columnLine">50</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FRONTIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">N HIS two years</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the West, Gell</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berry had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">very few safe de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posit vaults -- ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept the mountains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where nature had</seg><seg type="columnLine">deposited her gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and silver and copper and had appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently thrown away the key. By tacit</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreement, he was head of the firm, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took all the papers in the land deal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">folded them carefully, and placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in his pocketbook. He noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the papers from the land office,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on which the quit-claim deeds were</seg><seg type="columnLine">based, had been much handled, and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them there was a splotch that</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like dried blood. He paid it</seg><seg type="columnLine">no attention. So the papers reposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the old leather pocketbook, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clell always carried on his person.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clell wasn't crazy, by any means.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was an engineer. He saw at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance that with very little labor a dam</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be built just above the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin, and storm water enough stored</seg><seg type="columnLine">to irrigate considerable land. As soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Riley was out of sight, he picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remaining rifle, told Marshall he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to take a look farther up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorge, and left the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was little more than a mile from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin to the head of the creek, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">owing to the curve it couldn't be seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clell took his way up the gorge, scan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning the ground with critical eye. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">little way up the stream he came upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">pools of water, with lush grass and</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeds growing along the banks. Half</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mile from the cabin the gorge be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a crevasse, with towering walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stone, and the stream a tiny ripple</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the stone bed. By this time, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that the gorge ended, appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently, in the side of a mountain, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no way out, except the way he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come in. He went on, and came upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">an immense blue pool of water under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the over-hanging cliffs. A hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet above him, a tiny stream came</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the precipice. It looked like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver rope that unravelled as it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, until it was a broad tassel of spray</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the time it struck the pool and cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tiny rainbow on the dark blue water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was spellbound with the beauty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing. As he stood, looking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder, there was a great roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, seemingly all around him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last he tore himself away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beauty spot, searched out a way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and climbed the bluff on the east side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the creek. At the top of the bluff</seg><seg type="columnLine">he walked around to where the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream broke over the cliff, then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped and caught his breath. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring water was not far to seek.</seg><seg type="columnLine">About a hundred feet to the west of</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he stood was the head of Little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowlegs. A flood of pure, clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">water was pouring through a deep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide crevasse in the solid stone of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains. The tiny stream that</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowed into Big Bowlegs was simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">overflow from a low place in the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks that ran through an age-worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">channel to the cliff. From where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, Clell could see his own valley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and could see that it was far wider</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lower than that of Little Bowlegs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At that point, the head of Little Bow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs was a straight, stone channel for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several hundred feet, as if nature had</seg><seg type="columnLine">labored at it for a million years, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">some Titian had chiseled an immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">chute in the stone. The water was</seg><seg type="columnLine">level with the top, and sweeping by</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the speed of a railroad train.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clell turned from it, and started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the source. He had gone but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little way, when climbing on to a ledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stone lie saw for the first time, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basin Spring. It was a hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">across, and boiling and bubbling like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an immense pot. He crept to the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the spring, and gingerly put his</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger in the flood. It was icy cold!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The melting snow of the mountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">was finding its way to the sea through</seg><seg type="columnLine">crevices and grottoes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clell glanced up, and then started as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw a woman standing on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the basin. She was looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him, but if she was speaking he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't hear her from the rumble of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water. A little way beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman was a cabin. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing rose by the cabin door, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">just above the house, watered by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller spring, was a little garden</seg><seg type="columnLine">patch and some green alfalfa. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there were bright spots where</seg><seg type="columnLine">some homely flower bloomed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Walking around the rim, Clell</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed a brawling little stream that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from above the garden, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">emptied into the basin. The woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't run away. She didn't seem the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least frightened or embarrassed. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised. She was a young woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">little more than a girl, and she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty. Clell said, "Good evening."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl's teeth flashed white between</seg><seg type="columnLine">red lips as she returned his greeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do--do you--" and Clell stuck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," laughed the girl. "Strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it may seem, I do. I live in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin, with my father. Won't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">come and see him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clell would, and he did. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the cabin he told the young</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">woman his name was Clell Berry, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she told him her name was Jenny Ta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tum. How else could they be intro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced? There was no one else to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. That part of the West was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">very well up on conventionalities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The house was two log rooms, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little lean-to at one side. Flowers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were growing in every nook and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cranny about the place. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">some home-like, gripping thing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">this solitary cabin, lost here in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains, that Berry couldn't explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself just them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HEN they entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin, the visi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor saw a long-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">11	a i r e d, bushy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiskered old man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting by a win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow, f i n g e ri n g</seg><seg type="columnLine">some bits of broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">quartz.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is my father, Mr. Tatum, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berry," introduced Jenny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Glad to meet you, sir," and the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man extended a gnarled and knotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.

The facts were that old Ranse</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been out 011 a prospecting trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">three years before. Jenny had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him. The old fellow had fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">off a bluff and had broken about</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything that was breakable, knock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a dent in his head for good meas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Throughout his fight back to life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he muttered about that little pocket on</seg><seg type="columnLine">west prong. He got up again, but was</seg><seg type="columnLine">crippled for life, and now he only sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the window looking at his pieces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">quartz and muttering to himself about</seg><seg type="columnLine">this pocket. Perfectly rational when</seg><seg type="columnLine">roused out of his reverie, but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had talked a few moments intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently he would slip a cog and go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Clell looked again at the mammoth</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring and speculated on how much,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or rather how little, labor would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">required to turn a sufficient amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that great volume of water into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley, to irrigate all the farm land he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his partner had. It was the heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a primitive wilderness. Doubtless</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was the first time a trained eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever had studied the possibilities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spring as an irrigation project.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Reaching the bed of the gorge by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">perilous climb, Clell gave one hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance at the beautiful silver rope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he meant to enlarge until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could climb by it to fortune, and, sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciously he was thinking of a won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Clell Berry," he muttered to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, "you're just about the luckiest</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the world.

He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">found his partner bound and gagged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the dirt floor of the cabin. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a frightful lump on his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had been struck a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow, and he was groaning with pain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who did this!" demanded Clell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," replied Marshall</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakly. "After you left, I lay down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take a little nap.

Clell, like most good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natured, fair-minded men, was a ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror when he was mad, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">good and mad now. There was plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of room in that country for the few</seg><seg type="columnLine">people in it, without crowding, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't mean to be crowded. Buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spradley had found out, in some way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had come into the Bowlegs coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to beat him out of a claim.

It was a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">comedy to watch him, and Clell</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed outright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I know it's a joke, Clell, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but--I'll do my best to shoot the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next fellow that--oh, hell!

There was evidence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">also, that Marshall's pockets had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone through, but not a thing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing. This puzzled Clell, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no mention of it to his partner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who, apparently, had troubles enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They ate supper, tied Seelum to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon, right at the cabin door, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could watch him, then sat smok-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in silence.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounding hoofs of a running horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">came thundering tip the valley.

Neither of them had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in a gun-fight, but they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to try.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have admitted it--didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">even know it, in fact--but, subcon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciously, he was telling himself that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had found this wonderful woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">and didn't want her to meet the pol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished, affable John Marshall, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">music, until-- That was as far as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind went.

Where y'all</seg><seg type="columnLine">been ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Down to the railroad to get some</seg><seg type="columnLine">bacon and flour," replied Clell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No effort was made by either of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">partners to detain Mr. Riley, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon left, going down Big Bowlegs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as he had done on that first day</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they had brought him out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wonder what that old devil is</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging around here for," growled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clell, when Riley was out of hearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, he's just a shiftless old pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pector," replied Marshall.

Then he'll freeze to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death in a blizzard or starve in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert. Most of them are half crazy."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clell thought of Old Ranse Tatum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but didn't mention him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Mr. Riley is one prospector</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I can get along without," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead.

It looked as if, at some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, Nature had hurled down part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a mountain, and the seamed stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">had landed across the gorge. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">water supply came from what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed to be a spring, at the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the long pool formed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dam. That is, at the upper end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what would have been a deep pool, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter of a mile long, had there been</seg><seg type="columnLine">any water in it. The partners drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wagon around the end of the dam</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on toward the spring which Clell</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew was nothing but the water from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his silver rope, and which trickled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the gorge under the gravel that</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the solid stone floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Must have been ten years since it</seg><seg type="columnLine">rained in this country," commented</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marshall, "or there'd be water in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fissure in it." replied Clell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's what these ten bags of cement</seg><seg type="columnLine">are for. Nature has done just about</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything for us, up here. All we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to do is put on the finishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">touches, and we'll have a paradise."</seg><seg type="columnLine">On high ground, near the spring, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good part of their load was unloaded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath some bushes, and covered up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I feel better," said Clell, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon rattled back down to the cabin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I know what dynamite will do, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't enjoy riding on a load of it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Back at the cabin they unloaded a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plow, hoes, shovels, bags of seeds, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">miscellaneous supplies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now we're all set!" cried Clell, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wiped the sweat from his face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Can you plow, Marshall ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think so. I never plowed much,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I have a general working knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the business," and Marshall</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled in his whiskers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't mean to be bossy," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clell, "but the job of stopping the fis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure in the dam and turning water</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that spring I found is too hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you. If you'll keep house and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plow a little on both claims, just to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show our good faith as homesteaders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll work at the water problem."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine!

If</seg><seg type="columnLine">it hadn't been for you, I'd either have</seg><seg type="columnLine">starved to death or else I'd be back at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old home, broke, coughing away</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little time left me, with everybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitying me and at the same time wish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing I was out of the way. I'd rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">be dead. Yes, I'll plow what I can.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You go right ahead and boss the job."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two weeks passed. Clell was off</seg><seg type="columnLine">by daylight, every morning, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned at dark. Marshall saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, limy drill dust on Cell's over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alls, and knew he was preparing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast some stone, but he asked no</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions. He, too, was busy. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had plowed a considerable patch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">land on the upper claim, and enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the lower one to show good inten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every day, these two weeks, Clell</seg><seg type="columnLine">had eaten a good dinner of fresh vege-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables, wholesome bread and meat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee, at the Tatum cabin, while Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ranse's dog spurned the lunch he in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">variably carried. He felt ashamed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">not telling Marshall what was at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of the gorge, but he just couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it. He was willing to work for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick partner, and to divide everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">else with him, but Jenny Tatum was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">different matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every day Jenny Tatum watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the cabin door as Clell drove the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long churn drill into the soft stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrier that lay between him and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune, and he began to hope. True,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she knew nothing about him, but con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventions must be dispensed with on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frontier. He knew nothing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, except that her father was a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad old prospector, but that made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference to him. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other woman on earth like Jenny, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and never could be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had come out to where he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at work, late that afternoon, as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">often did, and stood watching him</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw the long drill and clean the drill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings from the hole with the narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron spoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the last hole," said Clell, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked up at her. "Pretty soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FRONTIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll shoot them, and then I'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">water on my land."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And pretty soon after that you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be busy on your farm and forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the water comes from," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, and there was a wistful note in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not in a thousand years!" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clell's voice trembled. "I've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything ready to turn the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Big Bowlegs, but unless--" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Unless, what?" murmured Jenny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Unless I can have you, I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want any water, don't want any farm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll go back to rambling."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked into her eyes, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next instant she was in his arms. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only other work Clell did that day was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take a sledge and cold chisel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">break away the stone at the low rim</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the basin. This let out enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">water to enlarge his silver rope about</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred times. As he went down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gorge, water was gurgling over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stones, and he knew there would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be plenty in the great pool by morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which to mix his cement and</seg><seg type="columnLine">close the fissure. Then he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to turn the stream into his en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanted valley. Then would come</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth, and--Jenny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said nothing of all this to Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall, but he couldn't help showing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiness in his beaming countenance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marshall saw it and attributed it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buoyant health which his partner</seg><seg type="columnLine">had and which he himself could never</seg><seg type="columnLine">regain. Marshall had a "fiddling fit"</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him that night. He rarely played,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except when lie was low-spirited. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't plowed any that day. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, was, he had had a slight hem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orrhage but had said nothing about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On into the night the violin poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">out its melody, but it was mostly sad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">classical compositions. Clell sat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">(lie cabin door, listened and wondered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sad music had driven the gay</seg><seg type="columnLine">mood from his heart. He thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buck Spradley, of Old Gray Hoss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riley, of Mosby and his apparent in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">timacy with Marshall. Someone</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted him out of the valley. Who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could it be, except Spradley? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he kept quiet the last two weeks?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wasn't the kind to give up without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fight. Ugly thoughts marched</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Clell's mind, like platoons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy soldiers. When at last they</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to bed, sleep didn't come quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as usual, and he was restless when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did finally sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clell woke with a start and sat up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his pallet. The moon was shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly and Marshall's pallet was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vacant. Clell called to him, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered from just outside the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A moment later, he came in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got a blue spell tonight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clell," he said. "Been sitting out there</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the old wagon tongue, looking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon, as I have so often done</seg><seg type="columnLine">since I've been in this country. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks as if one could almost reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon and stars. Do you believe in</seg><seg type="columnLine">premonitions ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," laughed Clell. "Guess my</seg><seg type="columnLine">liver's too active for that," and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched out on his pallet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two horses had been driven up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gorge, above the spring, and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">to graze on the greener grass and</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeds they found there. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dead stillness over the place, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clell fell asleep again. It seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that he had slept but a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Marshall shook him by the arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wake up, Clell," he whispered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Listen!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE great still-</seg><seg type="columnLine">:ss, they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">;ar the hoofs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">veral horses com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">g up the valley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They're coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive us out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time," said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Marshall, calmly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And we won't drive worth a</seg><seg type="columnLine">damn!" snapped Clell, as he drew on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his trousers and boots, buckled on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol, and sprang for his rifle that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in the corner. "Will you stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me, if it comes to a fight, Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll stay as long as I last, Clell, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm afraid I won't be much help. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never was in a gun-fight, and-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, in there!" called a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, yourself," returned Clell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What do you want?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come out here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't right now. I'm busy. State</seg><seg type="columnLine">your business; I can hear you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right. We come to notify you</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesters to get out of this valley. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a cow country, and we don't aim to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have any farmers in it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, you won't have any farms?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clell answered. "Well, now you listen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. There's one little farm 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowlegs that's going to stay right</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. We have a title to the land,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Government, and if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't get away from here and stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, somebody'll get hurt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reply was a volley of shots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peering out through a crack, Clell had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen six mounted men. One of them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was Old Gray Hoss Riley. The others</seg><seg type="columnLine">were strangers. Buck Spradley wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them. As the bullets spattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin wall, one or two coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">through cracks, Clell's rifle spat a</seg><seg type="columnLine">streak of flame, and Riley slid from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his old gray bag 0' bones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Get down and rush 'em, fellers!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">called the man who had been the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spokesman and seemed to be the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">leader. "They're just a coupla damned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tenderfoots."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At the word, Clell and Marshall</seg><seg type="columnLine">both began working their guns. Clell</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mad, now, and beside himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Come on in, damn you!" he called</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out, in a lull of the firing, as he shoved</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fresh cartridges through the loading-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gate of his Winchester. "My feet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">may be tender, but my hands are hard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from honest work. I can't shoot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much, but I can hit like hell!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The gang dismounted and bunched</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a rush. Two streams of fire from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin wall poured into them. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of the six went down. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">three fled toward their horses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Through his lookout, Clell saw four</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more men gallop up to the fray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Reinforcements! Now we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">have it!" he growled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Marshall, leaning against the wall,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">coughed slightly but said nothing. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had said he would stay as long as he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lasted, and he was staying. Clell had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no time to look at his partner. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">funny thing was happening out there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the moonlight. The four new-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">comers had covered the three sur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vivors of the battle, and coolly hand-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cuffed them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">-	"Hello, within there!" called one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "All right," replied Clell. "What's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on your mind? Want a little of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">same ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Not any, thank you!" laughed the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man. "We're state Rangers and tried</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to catch this gang before they got</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">here. Let's suspend hostilities, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">see what you have done to them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At that instant, Clell heard a chok-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing noise from Marshall's corner of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the cabin, and turned just in time to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">see his partner turn loose the wall to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which he had been holding and slump</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Clell lit the old battered lantern,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the captain of the Ranger squad</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One dead, and two hurt bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to hold 'em for a while, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside. What's the casualty list in</seg><seg type="columnLine">here ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "My partner's hit," faltered Clell,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">looking up from where he knelt by</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WATERS OF BOWLEGS CREEK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the side of Marshall, who was covered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ranger went over the still form</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lay on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, your partner's hit, pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard," A moment later he said. "He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead. I guess that bullet caused his</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, but the blood didn't come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wound." Then, lowering his voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He was a lunger, wasn't he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clell nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought so," continued the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranger. "It's murder, just the same,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and will be the finish of this gang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We've been trying to catch them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the goods for a year. It is a regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">organized business. They have filed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on claims like this all along the foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills. A tenderfoot comes along; some</seg><seg type="columnLine">member steers him to one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">claims, telling him it can be bought</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a song. He buys it, and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang runs him off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time, they had walked to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. In spite of the battle and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marshall's death, Clell was thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of another matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What about that claim on Little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowlegs?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," replied the Ranger captain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"was another one they used. The land</seg><seg type="columnLine">is worthless, but there's plenty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, and the green settler grabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Fellow by the name of Mosby</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked it. They hadn't bumped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sucker for months, and we thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd quit. Then a few days ago a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man named Spradley came to us with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tale about trading for Mosby's claim</seg><seg type="columnLine">and afterward being run ragged until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he left it. Then we heard somebody</seg><seg type="columnLine">was plowing the claims on Big Bow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs, and hurried up here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clell said nothing. He was pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure Spradley knew all about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim on Little Bowlegs, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended to bump him with it, but had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been caught in his own net.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Come morning, and the Rangers</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped Clell bury his late partner 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit of rising ground at the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Mr. Berry," said the Ranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain, "we'll pay you to take your</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon and haul this quiet gent, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wanted dead or alive, Gray IIoss</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the other cripple, and the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound ones, down to headquarters."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You can take the team and bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">it back," said Clell. "I don't want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave here just now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't blame you much.

Don't think</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I could use any money I got that way,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Clell,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T WAS midafter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon. John Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall's old brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">violin lay silent in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its case. Clell had</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead man's meager</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but some odds and ends of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing and a book or two. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to identify him. No former address.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From a little bunch of keys found in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marshall's pocket, he fitted one to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather-bound, trunk-shaped valise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened it. Here, Clell expected to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find papers that would tell whom to</seg><seg type="columnLine">notify of his partner's death. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did find was a single sheet of pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per. The last will and testament of</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Marshall, dated the day before</seg><seg type="columnLine">and written in ink, in a clear hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scholarly language. It left his wagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and team, his interest in the claims,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all his earthly effects to McClel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lan Berry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clell folded it reverently and placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in his pocketbook for safe keeping.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whoever and whatever Marshall may</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been, there was 110 evidence now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A little heap of paper ashes in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fireplace, evidently made the day be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, and unnoticed by Clell until now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore mute testimony of the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughness. Clell was thinking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sadly, that they had buried him almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he was cold, when a shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell in the cabin door. He started</seg><seg type="columnLine">violently, and turned to see the tear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stained face of Jenny Tatum!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wha--what's the matter?" stam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered Clell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Fa--father's d-dead!" Jenny</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbed, as she sank to a proffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp stool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then she sobbed out her story. Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ranse had spells in which he fell and</seg><seg type="columnLine">became unconscious. A doctor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">told her once it was caused by clots</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the brain and that some time it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would kill him. That morning he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen, and in spite of all her efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old prospector's spirit had gone to</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigate the "little pocket" in an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she had rested a while, Clell</seg><seg type="columnLine">took up his pick and shovel and si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lently led the way up the gorge. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing to say. At least, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue was not schooled to say the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things that might be said, so he used</seg><seg type="columnLine">the true language of sympathy--si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a little cove, above the garden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a juniper tree, Clell made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave. Then lie took up, tenderly, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">emaciated body of the broken old</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospector, and laid it to its last long</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep. When the last shovelful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth had been replaced, they returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the cabin, and sat in the doorway</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the sun sank in the west.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jenny told him she had 110 one to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to, 110 relatives, 110 friends. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother, who had died when she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve, had taught her many things;</seg><seg type="columnLine">among others, to be a true woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After her mother's death, she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone from place to place with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">father. The last four years, they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived in this cabin, spending sparingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the proceeds of the "little pocket,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which Ranse was always talking. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about gone now. Their last trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the little mining town, thirty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the range, had almost cleaned it</seg><seg type="columnLine">up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't want you to go to anybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">else, Jenny," faltered Clell, but-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know, Clell.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen or more gold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seekers from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearhy bars on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yuba River were on hand to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-by to "Sailor" Hargraves. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">great California gold rush of 1849 was</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching its crest. "The City", as</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Francisco was known throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">the diggings, was overflowing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth. Crowds of red-shirted miners</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the crccks, anxious to exchange</seg><seg type="columnLine">their dust for something--anything--</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything that caught their eye--met</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mingled with the vast horde of ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venturers drawn from all parts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. From the over-taxed saloons</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the droning cry, "Money on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar," indicating a lucky man inviting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world to celebrate with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even Downieville, born only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">months before, was bubbling with ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement. The guest of the evening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edward Hargraves, was returning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Australia with the avowed intention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovering a goldfield even greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that of California. Like many</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, he had come hotfoot to the Cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ifornia diggings one year before. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not been successful as a miner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this soldier, sailor and bushman. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps he was more of a talker than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">worker. He certainly had a flair for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the theatrical and was given to boast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of Australia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half a century before this little fare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well celebration took place, England's</seg><seg type="columnLine">political heads were puzzling over what</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do with a huge island in the South-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern Seas. A penal colony! Good idea!</seg><seg type="columnLine">So for fifty years she had dumped her</seg><seg type="columnLine">convicts there--some cut-throats of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowest type, others misguided idealists</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had queer political views. As a</seg><seg type="columnLine">result about one-half of the popula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of Australia were either convicts</seg><seg type="columnLine">or "emancipists"--the latter, convicts</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had served their terms but were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not permitted to return to the mother-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even if you did discover a gold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field in Australia, Hargraves, that old</seg><seg type="columnLine">queen of yours wouldn't let you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the gold," an emancipist from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Australia sneered, while Hargraves</seg><seg type="columnLine">boasted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Queen Victoria, God bless her, will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be informed that I have discovered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great goldfield and will make me one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her Gold Commissioners and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps afterward a peer of the realm,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hargraves replied, striking an attitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Curiously enough a large part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this childish boast was destined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come true!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arrived in Sydney, New South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wales, Hargraves tried to induce old</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends and acquaintances to put up</seg><seg type="columnLine">funds for him to make an expedition</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the "back-blocks" to discover a</seg><seg type="columnLine">goldfield. He pointed out that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just come from California and was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">expert at both discovering and washing</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold. His friends refused to put their</seg><seg type="columnLine">56</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">money into such a wild speculation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing daunted, he invested the few</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars that represented all his capital</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a saddle horse. He then rode across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Blue Mountains, through Bathurst,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Guyong, where he picked up a native</seg><seg type="columnLine">guide and plunged into the wilderness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About fifteen miles from the settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, at a point 011 Lewis Pond's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Creek, a tributary of the McQuarie</seg><seg type="columnLine">River, the two men prepared their first</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal. Having eaten, Hargraves, prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably regretting that he had no larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">audience, informed the native of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">object of their expedition. The eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the "blackfellow" bulged with ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement. This slight encouragement</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sufficient to cause Hargraves to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get to his feet. "Right where we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">now resting is a goldfield," he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced. "It is all about us. I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove it to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took a dishpan and washed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pan of dirt. It showed a few grains</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gold! In all he washed five pans</seg><seg type="columnLine">in rapid succession and four of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed colors. Later he admitted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his talk had been bluff; he had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped that gold was there!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few weeks later, Hargraves</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked into the office of the Honor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able Deas-Thompson, Colonial Secre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary, at Sydney, and opened a mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious paper package. The official</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in a cheerful frame of mind. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened to his visitor with patience and</seg><seg type="columnLine">good humor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By Jove, my man, it is gold!" h«S</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally exclaimed, adjusting his eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">AUSTRALIA--FORTUNE LAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses.

Nearly thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years before, one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">die convicts at Bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">any Bay showed a specimen of gold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashed quartz he claimed he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found. When asked to show the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of discover, he was unable to find it</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and was awarded one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fifty lashes for his "deception".</seg><seg type="columnLine">A few years later a gang of convicts</seg><seg type="columnLine">building a road through the Blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountains found a number of gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimens, but the news was promptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppressed because it was feared that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the convicts would get out of hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In 1841, ten years before Hargraves</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned from California, a bushman</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Adam Forres found a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">size nugget and showed it to W.

Clarke took it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Governor Gipps, who dismissed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter by saying, "Put it away, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clarke, put it away, or we shall all</seg><seg type="columnLine">have our throats cut." Clarke there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon advised his friends, who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited about the find, that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not make it public as he feared it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might lead to the "utter disorganiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of society".</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The investigation of Hargraves' dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery promised by Secretary Deas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thompson took place.

The geol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ogist was forced to admit the gold was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. The news was reported in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">press. The stampede was on! What a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government geologist said 01* thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not matter now; he was brushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside like a chip in the wind. Within a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few days four hundred amateur miners</seg><seg type="columnLine">were milling around the spot where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hargraves had washed his historic pan</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before Hargraves' find was fully ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepted, two new fields were discovered,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one on the Turon River and another</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Abercrombie, and these were</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed almost immediately by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Kerr strike". At a little sheep sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion on the banks of the Merro River,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a "blackboy" horsebreaker, idly chip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping at a quartz boulder, struck harder</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he had intended and split the rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealing to his astonished gaze a core</seg><seg type="columnLine">of solid gold bigger than his fist. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">other similar boulders were promptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken up, bringing to light even larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">chunks of solid gold.

Within a few weeks from al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most every point of the compass re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports of new discoveries were coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, one on the heels of the other.

Mount Alexander,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for instance, produced more than ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand ounces of gold in the first fif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen days of existence. Any man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spade and tin dish could be a success-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful miner. Indeed, few knew anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mining, shown by the fact that many</seg><seg type="columnLine">claims were abandoned and re-aban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doned only to yield fortunes to second</seg><seg type="columnLine">and third comers. One such aband-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oned claim, the "Poor Boy" at Eureka,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yielded a nugget of pure gold weighing</seg><seg type="columnLine">over six hundred ounces. In another</seg><seg type="columnLine">instance, a pillar of earth, left as a sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port in a deserted claim at Bendigo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">calved a nugget weighing more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred ounces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The effect of these discoveries was</seg><seg type="columnLine">two-fold; to the officials, it was a cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amity; to the masses, it was a wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall. The officials saw in it only a pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible uprising of the convicts and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moralization of the laboring classes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Commissioner of Lands at Bath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urst, hearing of Hargraves' activities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent a special message to the governor</seg><seg type="columnLine">advising "that steps be taken to pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent the working classes from desert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their regular employment for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">goldfields".

And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the white apron also filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maddox's two canteens with fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Then, as Haj clumsily mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rode away swaying in the saddle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the server of refreshment shrugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He'll never make through, damn'</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he will!" was his muttered judg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.

He had been a cowman</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a farmer, never a miner. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Mormon apostate and a bitter enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all things Mormon. Three emis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">saries came at various times from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mormon State of Deseret, determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill him. Three grimly lettered</seg><seg type="columnLine">crosses over at the Boot Hill at Hart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nett revealed the gun speed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrewdness of the quarry, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stark courage, also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stun-Bruise had been a Mormon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He loved a Mormon girl and had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier wives.

She fled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">night to the man of her heart's choice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he rose to the occasion.

She knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">her fate, and smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stone's greatest weakness came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface then, unfortunately. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways he had been a hard man, just but</seg><seg type="columnLine">inflexible--owing to the influence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his Mormon training, perhaps. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cursed harshly, holding himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that little, red-cuticled atom responsi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble for his wife, Genevra's, death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">True, he did not level an accusation</seg><seg type="columnLine">even mentally against the tiny lad; yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feeling overwhelmed paternal af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fection from the very first. He avoided</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of the infant. Getting an Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman to care for the baby tempo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rarily, he then hired a widow at Tono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pah, a rather coy lady of thirty who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had one child of her own--and definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes still in the field of matrimony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So four and one-half years passed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The widow, from the first honestly ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miring Sheriff Stone Bellinger, took</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellent care of little Dick, and, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the months grew into years, im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planted in the baby mind a hero wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship of the stern, hard-riding sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">father. But those years ended it. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle-aged assayer stopped for a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Hartnett. The widow, despairing</seg><seg type="columnLine">now of ever becoming Mrs. Stone Bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">linger, smiled at the newcomer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">used her wiles successfully. Dickie</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost the nearest to a mother he ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">had known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only other white woman of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">region available then was Mrs. Thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesson, a dull-featured, big-armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scandinavian of forty-odd, the mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cled, ignorant relict of a drunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">miner. Mrs. Thorgesson seemed happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to leave her washboard, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. She plunged into housekeeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and the care of a child with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough-handed enthusiasm. She sewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">several pairs of red flannel kilts for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dickie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, each time she was paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Stone, she guzzled a quart or</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereabouts of whisky and let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">household run itself for thirty-six</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dickie never had seen kilts before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He hated them and protested vehem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently. But in the old country, kilts for</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys had been up-to-date attire when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Thorgesson had been a flicka.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore she overruled his protests</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a heavy hand. Once when Dickie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rebelious, had dared even to run to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">father he rarely saw, Stone was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to become outwardly sympathetic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mebbe pretty soon he's big enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPAREJOS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">61</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for pants," he said gruffly, and strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But nothing short of an outright</seg><seg type="columnLine">command would have made an impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion on the phlegmatic Mrs. Thorges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. She grunted, fingering the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had got. And then, when she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure Stone had ridden out of town,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she went to the Squeejaw honkytonk</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her quart of liquor. An hour later</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was singing hoarsely. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no supper prepared that night for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngster. Me found some hard bread,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and choked down a few bites of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a throat constricted with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain of tears which under the kindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">care of bis first foster-mother he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned to repress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had fallen asleep, still clothed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the rear door squeaked on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">rusted hinges. He did not awaken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor did the housekeeper hear. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouching, bulbous shadow entered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment it squatted in the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, then tiptoed into the shack. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">time only petty pilfering was the pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose of the stealthy intruder, but on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his next visit Haj Maddox would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a far more serious mission! He in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended to fulfill that mission soon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the moment, though, he walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on tiptoe, a faint jangle coming from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his Mexican spurs. In place of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty, overturned whisky bottle beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snoring housekeeper, Haj left a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quart with seals unbroken. Then from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heap of clothing in one corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next room, he sorted out a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes and a pair of stockings--tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">size--and, grinning, fled with these to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After some trouble he had located</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mining claim of Toi-Yabe Tolman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the stealth which was his Pima</seg><seg type="columnLine">heritage, Maddox would leave these</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolen trifles of child attire somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereabouts. He rode, grinning evilly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It might be possible even yet to col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lect that reward. At any rate he, Haj,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would secure ample revenge upon Toi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yabe, whom he hated. And then there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be the youngster--ransom, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps. That far in advance his brut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish mind was content to figure only</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">half off, half on the cot bed. Dickie</seg><seg type="columnLine">scowled. He called to her, at first in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a low, disapproving voice, but then</seg><seg type="columnLine">louder. He was hungry; couldn't she</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time she couldn't. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened earlier and found the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond bottle. It would be many, many</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours before she took an interest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the affairs of her charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hard lump tightened in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy's throat. His lower lip quivered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its usual line of decision. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't want any more of that darn'</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard bread. He was hungry!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An idea struck him. He went into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own room, and rummaged through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a broken tomato packing case where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept the odds and ends of his small</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessions. He had money! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would go to Chong Yen's restaurant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and buy bre'fuss, jes' like daddy did!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The money was in a bronze coin</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank, the figure of an Indian. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken, it rattled faintly. Dickie knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to get the money out; he had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Torky do it. So now he pried</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shook and shook; and finally out</seg><seg type="columnLine">jingled the money--a dime and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">nickels. That was all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the little fellow saw no discrep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancy between that sum and the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">prices for edibles chalked on the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Chong Yen's restaurant-laundry</seg><seg type="columnLine">next door to the lantern-jawed, leer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Squeejaw. He left the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">squaring his shoulders importantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and marched down the dusty single</seg><seg type="columnLine">street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chong Yen, thriftily utilizing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning hours in washing for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town, came forward, arms soapy. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps just the glint of surprised recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nition showed in his seamed, parch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "H'lo. How do, li'l fellah?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioned, wiping his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bre'fuss! Me's hungry!" an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced Dickie with careful nonchal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, standing on tiptoe to slap the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty cents upon the lunch counter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, by stepping on the rail and knee-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up, he managed to mount one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stools. The level of the board still</seg><seg type="columnLine">came even with his chin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lots o' bre'fuss!" he repeated, of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden an odd, unsure notelike wist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulness shaking the peremptory deci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. After all, he was a very small</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy, acting for the first time in his five</seg><seg type="columnLine">years as a man of affairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chong Yen looked at him, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small change on the counter, and cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brief, expressionless glance at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chalked menu--the least item of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, "Coffee--two-bits "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But then a quick, subtle change came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his wooden features. Perhaps Chong</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yen liked children. Perchance he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called one time years before when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a newcomer in Hartnett, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day on which the father of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny lad intervened just when some</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunken miners were engaged in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hilarious pastime of braiding his queue</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the tail of a bronc with nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At any rate he grinned and chuck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">led. He came around the counter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Missy Tolgesson dlunk?" he que-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ye-ah!" said Dickie, with distaste</seg><seg type="columnLine">and resentment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh!" grunted Chong Yen. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted Dickie from the stool and car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried him back. There was a low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrupulously clean board table, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">box which stood on end made an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellent chair. Forthwith the Chinaman</seg><seg type="columnLine">set forth a dish of delicious canncd</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaches, which Dickie devoured, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">while watching with anxious, glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes the further preparations. Chong</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut and sawed out the tenderloin of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice beefsteak, and had it sizzling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">no time. Hot rice, toasted bread, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dish of beans with hot, crisped bacon</seg><seg type="columnLine">--perhaps not the fare for a pampered</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby, but Dickie did not know the taste</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fresh milk, and was accustomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearty plain food. He ate till he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat no more, then sighed vastly, getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with difficulty. He never had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been pampered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fanks," he said--and then remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered the business side of the transac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. "I give you my money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chong grinned. Then his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly became impassive again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suah!" he agreed, bowing. "Mak'</seg><seg type="columnLine">change!" And with that he gravely</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed back a dime and a nickel. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">that transaction there was more under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing of his youthful customer than</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have lain in the providing gratis</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a dozen meals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the Oriental let him leave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dickie carried a neat bundle in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">reposed two cheese and two ham sand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiches. Chong knew "Old Torky,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in an obscure way he was repaying</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long cherished debt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">N THE way back a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexican lounger</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratuitously insult-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed Dickie--right at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy's pride had</seg><seg type="columnLine">swelled almost to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bursting point!</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Buenos dias, nina!" he greeted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ICKIE BELLIN-</seg><seg type="columnLine">GER awoke raven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous. He scrambled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, jerked with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scowl at his rum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pled kilts, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran in to the lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, reeking room</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the housekeeper. "Old Torky," as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he called her, still slept. She sprawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">62</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FRONTIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mockingly, doffing his sombrero and</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing white, even teeth in a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dickie gasped. Little girl, indeed!</seg><seg type="columnLine">His chin came up with a snap and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny fists clenched. He ignored the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lounger, but his steps hurried, became</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneven, and a rosy flush overwhelmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cheeks and flowed over the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his neck. Nina! It was those darn',</seg><seg type="columnLine">darn' kilts! Oh why couldn't he have</seg><seg type="columnLine">pants like a big man--an'--an' chaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">like daddy wore?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stone Bellinger alone, among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospectors, miners and general drift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers at Hartnett, wore leather chapare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jos as he rode. A cowman lie had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been, and a cowman sheriff he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain, even though his lot was cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">among other sorts of Westerners. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest ranch of any sort lay in the se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded Demijohn Valley, forty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles to the northeast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last steps Dickie took at a run,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flinging himself inside the shack and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slamming the door. Dry sobs were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throat, but no tears flowed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw without caring that Old Torky</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not come to consciousness. Darn</seg><seg type="columnLine">her anyway! Darn her for making</seg><seg type="columnLine">him wear kilts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But then he looked into his own dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered room, and what he saw spilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a table brought a flash of inspira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. A sewing basket had been over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned. Shears--chaps! Maybe pants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He closed Old Torky's door silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tiptoed back to the table. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the implements! Hastily seizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">scissors and a paper of safety pins that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay on top, he dropped to the floor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled under the table. There he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled the cover down until he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">screened from any casual observer who</seg><seg type="columnLine">might come into the room, and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">busily to work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poking the sharp-pointed shears</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the material of his red kilts at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waistline in front, he sawed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way down the weave of the-cloth until</seg><seg type="columnLine">a last chew of the none-too-sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">shears severed the binding at the bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom. This made the kilts gape open</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarmingly in front, but Dickie stuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">manfully to his task, his fingers trem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling from over-zealousness and a rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">of excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Straining his rounded stomach into</seg><seg type="columnLine">smallest compass, he managed to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kilts completely around so that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slit was exactly at the back. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated the process with the scissors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting a new slit down the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the kilts. This finished, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped the shears from his trembling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers and seized the paper of safety</seg><seg type="columnLine">pins. A little flush of triumph rose in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face as he succeeded in pinning to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether the bottom flaps around above</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right knee. Here were his trou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sers! In his excitement he stuck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of a pin deep in his finger, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on, disregarding the pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a trice he had fastened three pins</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his right pants-leg, and two in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. That would do, because some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how or other he couldn't make his fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers work to fasten the other pin. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiptoed again to the hall door and lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Torky snored. Triumphant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dickie flushed as he looked down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his handiwork. On the wall hung a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracked mirror the beloved daddy used</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he shaved. Dickie climbed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and secured it. His blue eyes glistened</seg><seg type="columnLine">with pleasure then as he held the glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way and that, reflecting the meta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morphosed kilts. Course they weren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly pants, but they were a lot bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter than those darn', darn' things!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now if he only had chaparejos to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wear outside!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The drive of inspiration was in him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though. He looked down. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">littered floor was an old fragment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rag carpet, raveled at the edges and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The sheriff unrolled the bundle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff with dirt. Dickie caught his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. The chaps! Sitting down with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dull shears, he forthwith attacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ancient fabric.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It proved a long, slow job, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">which made his hand and wrist ache</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiercely. The hours dragged along.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the other room Old Torky ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">snoring, and groaned heavily. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was the sound of a staggering</seg><seg type="columnLine">step, a gurgle as of liquid being de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">canted--another gurgle. Then by and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">by, a creak of cot springs. And finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">another snore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dicky had sawed out one long, ir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular triangle of rug and affixed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">by pins and raveling tied together,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when his aching arm and the demands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his stomach made him call a halt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He remembered the sandwiches, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forthwith ate them all. It was long</seg><seg type="columnLine">past noon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, the joy of creation a trifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">dulled, but determination unimpaired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he started the task of sawing out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">duplicate, growing heavy-eyed as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows crept down from the west-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward buttes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UT in a valley of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Red Chalk</seg><seg type="columnLine">Range, Toi-Yabe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tolman frowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">down puzzledly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pair of small</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes and a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">child's stockings he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found behind a boulder. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him. A kid of some kind! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley, though, was as silent as a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert calm; even his own animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not grazing on the sparse vegeta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion jus then. He was sure that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one else could be within miles--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain also, or nearly so, that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">garments had not been behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulder the day before. Why, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat on that stone to eat his beans and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pan biscuit! Yet he might have over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked them, as he had been thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost entirely of Haj Maddox and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what that treacherous coyote might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected to do with his knowledge that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ex-bandit, Toi-Yabe Tolman, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toi-Yabe rolled up the shoes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stockings and tossed them back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place he had found them. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked deep into the crannies of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow cave he used as a provision</seg><seg type="columnLine">cache, and later devoted a half hour to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a climb, reaching a spot which gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a bird's-eye view of the valley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But beside a pair of far buzzards</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly circling, no living thing was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight.

"Got enough water?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toi-Yabe merely gestured at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow black aperture which housed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his water cans and grubstake. Bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">linger investigated, poured a panful</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the roan and a drink for himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he slouched back to the fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured himself a cup of coffee, and ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepted the tin plate heaped with beans</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bacon, tendered by Toi-Yabe, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nod of acknowledgement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such was desert hospitality given</seg><seg type="columnLine">and taken by men almost a match in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sternness and taciturnity. Toi-Yabe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">realizing that the sheriff simply had</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanced upon the claim at the end of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long ride and had grasped the chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rest his horse, would not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken during the moments of smok-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that followed except that he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered the curious find made that</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. Reaching back of the boulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he brought up the small roll of shoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stockings he had discovered, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed them across the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ever see any yonkers up thisa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way?" he queried. "These was lyin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">here when I come back from town."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The officer unrolled the bundle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then a frown gathered on his fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. Why, those things looked about</seg><seg type="columnLine">big enough for his own kid--really</seg><seg type="columnLine">something like the duds he'd seen on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dickie a few times! But of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no possible way Dickie could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">get out here, he assumed. Besides his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own son, however. Stone Bellinger</seg><seg type="columnLine">strove in vain to recall any children</seg><seg type="columnLine">this size in the region outside of a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexican babies down at Tres Casas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and these, of course, wore neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes nor stockings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yuh say yuh ain't seen any party</seg><seg type="columnLine">up this side of the Red Chalk?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioned, glancing keenly up through</seg><seg type="columnLine">graying brows. He did not know or</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask the name of his host; a shrewd</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge of men was Stone Bellinger, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who cared nothing for names or</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready-made reputations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nope." Toi-Yabe's answer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">laconic, final.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Bellinger considered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I reckon I'll tote 'em along</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me, in the mornin'," he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded. And he went to roll up in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankets, without further ado.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next morning he was up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">false dawn's graying, before Toi-Yabe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">built a fire, fed and watered the roan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the coffee, and prepared a sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple meal. Seeing that the prospector</seg><seg type="columnLine">still slumbered--apparently only; Toi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yabe was not altogether sure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff's intentions--Stone ate quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in silence, then set the coffee pot</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the dying embers, saddled, and rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">away toward Golman's Well. Toi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yabe waited until the clicking of hoofs</seg><seg type="columnLine">died away into silence before thrusting</seg><seg type="columnLine">back a revolver into its holster and</seg><seg type="columnLine">arising. He grinned a trifle wryly; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">year before, it would have been court-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sudden death for him to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">camped a night with any sheriff!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">N HOUR later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his drilling for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small blasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge completed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toi-Yabe affixed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap and generous</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of fuse to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sticks of forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">per cent. He lighted the sputtering</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord with its heart of black powder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then hastened over to the gully in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the animals were tethered. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">burros could be counted 011; they knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamite; but Cochise, the pinto pony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">always snorted and reared, a wild,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straining whiteness coming into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Only when Toi-Yabe was near</seg><seg type="columnLine">could he be prevented from going into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nervous frenzy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seconds elapsed. Then a satisfying</seg><seg type="columnLine">grroommm! announced that the tamp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing had been effective; that the force</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the giant powder had been exerted</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward, as well a9 in the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the shaft mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if that explosion had been an</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaited signal, a sudden, faint pop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">popping began, home to Toi-Yabe</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemingly from over the low mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">into which he was driving the shaft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He listened, tense, making certain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun battle--for the character of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fast shooting was unmistakable</seg><seg type="columnLine">--was not in his valley, though proba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bly just beyond the ridge. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged. It was none of his affair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He went back to examine the shaft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bending to fan away the poisonous</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumes with broad-brimmed Stetson</seg><seg type="columnLine">before sliding down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A cursory glance was rather disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing. The rock showed no marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">change in character, being if anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trifle more barren in appearance. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly Toi-Yabe became quiet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched on one knee. He had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a most curious sound, one which</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought every desert trained faculty</seg><seg type="columnLine">into play! A low, rushing murmur</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to his ears!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That instant he became aware, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a strange coolness was seeping in</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his lowered knee and shin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quickly he bent lower, testing with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear, sniffing carefully. He heard it</seg><seg type="columnLine">more plainly now. Water! He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">near a subterranean stream or spring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that almost priceless discovery in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">arid range! Water! If cool and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet, it would allow him uninter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted search for treasure, and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort beyond imagining!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At last he found the tiny crevice</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which a distinct chill of air</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose in a steady current. With his ear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the crack he could hear the mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">muring rush of waters even more dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinctly. Feverishly then, forgetting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the time all thoughts of gold, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">widened the crack, and into it thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">a prepared dynamite cartridge. Light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the fuse, he scrambled out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Such was his haste he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse a furtive, oddly clad little fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure on an abutment of rock just above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Thoroughly frightened, gasping for</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath after his flight and climb to es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape the terrible man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched him from his bed before</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn that morning, Dickie Bellinger</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to climb down and speak to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall, lean prospector--but had been too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much in the grip of terror. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety pins had opened, allowing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of his rough cut "chaps" to drag</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind as he crawled on hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees, but he paid it no attention now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wanted someone, anyone--even</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Torky would have been welcome.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So he came closer to that funny hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the big man had gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">64</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FRONTIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was close enough now so he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could almost rubberneck over and see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man, when suddenly the latter re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, scrambling, running. Toi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yabe had used only a short length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuse this time, and he possessed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholesome respect for dynamite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dickie stared, bewildered. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">made that funny man run in and out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hole? Was it the big bang he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That second, while Toi-Yabe still</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprinted for the horse, Dickie's ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions were answered decisively. Of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden a hideous, jarring roar blasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears. The rock upon which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched, quaked and leaped, throw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him sidewise, and the shock drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness from him. He saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swirl of black and green; then he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was as well. Though protected</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a foot-high sleeve of rim rock so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that none of the upflung debris struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">him directly, Dickie had perched on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">battered ledge which had been about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">slide of its own weight. The second</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock was just enough; unostenta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiously nine hundred pounds of rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracking to fragments, broke away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated, then slumped gently into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospect shaft, bearing on its top a tat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, unconscious little five-year-old</seg><seg type="columnLine">who on this morning alone had lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">through enough perils for a lifetime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toi-Yabe was delayed a few min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes in spite of his impatience. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinto, Cochise, just then decided he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had quite enough of these rumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosions, and acted fractious. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toi-Yabe saw neither the small ava-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lanche nor the figure of Dickie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he came on as soon as possible;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was while fanning the fumes</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his Stetson that he caught sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of something decidedly strange there</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bottom of the shaft. Was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yellow, curly head of a child, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the love of heaven? He blinked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped as sudden, icy dread clutched</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart. His mind raced. The shoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stockings--the sheriff's pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">question--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had he killed some little youngster</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknowingly ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VEN as these</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was scrambling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, however. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit sliding in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose rock. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a child, a boy, half</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried, but still breathing! Toi-Yabe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flung himself to his knees, tearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">away the rock with his finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God, I hope he ain't hurt!" he half</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayed in the stress of anxiety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then came an odd straining</seg><seg type="columnLine">creak from the floor and the rock walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him; supposedly solid as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, just then they moved slowly an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch, two-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Toi-Yabe was lifting out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngster, noting with increasing be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilderment the queer attire--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that Dickie wore both shoes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stockings. Hurriedly examining the</seg><seg type="columnLine">child, Toi-Yabe could discover naught</seg><seg type="columnLine">save a multitude of small bruises. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">then Dickie sighed and moved in Toi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yabe's arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh--oh!" he gasped.

Tumbling headlong, he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the black, fathomless pit. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief split second of falling he touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing; and gave himself up for lost.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no telling how deep might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be this awesome subterranean cavern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found out almost instantly. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ripping splash which reverberated</seg><seg type="columnLine">from close-constricting walls, the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of rock ceiling struck the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a black, sweeping, almost silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">river hastening on its way beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock arches to the flume which gave it</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the daylight in the far, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">inaccessible canyon of the Virgin</seg><seg type="columnLine">River.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toi-Yabe and his companion in mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune struck the upflung spray in</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling; and then his breath was caught</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from him in a constricted gasp. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">clove the surface of an icy stream, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught by the full force of the deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">current, and fought with a reaction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">furious energy against the whirling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sucking current, against the bruising</seg><seg type="columnLine">outthrusts of the rock wall, and above</seg><seg type="columnLine">all against the unbelievable chill of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">subterranean river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The immersion brought a choked</seg><seg type="columnLine">outcry of terror from Dickie, coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly to consciousness. With child-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish instinct he flung both arms about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the neck of Toi-Yabe and held on with</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his strength. It was, perhaps, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best thing possible, as Toi-Yabe, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following seconds, could not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">spare the use of one arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was no sunken spring of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert, gradually cooled by its hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">course. In its majestic onsweep could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be recognized the force of miles of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scent and the pull of a predetermined</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlet. In its gripping cold was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste of far distant snows of the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sierras.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hampered as he was by Dickie, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy boots, crisscrossed belts with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their weights of cartridges and bol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stered six-guns, Toi-Yabe struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">for every breath he drew. Much of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time, as helpless as a curled pinon</seg><seg type="columnLine">chip in a whirlpool, he was drawn be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the surface, flung sidewise or</seg><seg type="columnLine">end-on against slime-smoothed gran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ite, or bruised by obstacles in the curv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He scraped his fingernails along a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slippery wall, and then without warn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was tossed to the far side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. There he struck with stunning</seg><seg type="columnLine">force against something which held</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a moment in spite of the dragging</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of the relentless river. Instinct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ively he clutched and, though his fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers slipped as if trying for a hold on</seg><seg type="columnLine">buttered brass, this was a rock forma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of such shape that he was allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to grip one elbow about it, clasping his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own bent wrist. Instantly he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">swirled about, his boots swinging to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface as his body skittered as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">float of little appreciable weight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on, kid!" he gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only then did he truly come to grips</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the immensity of the stream's mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentum. For several seconds he</seg><seg type="columnLine">held on, breathing in great gasps of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chill air, coughing and choking out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water which had descended to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not dodge comprehension of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the issue. If once he let go of this up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right column which, like an I-beam, let</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flood roar past on both sides, both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them were finished. He never would</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHA PARE JOS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">05</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have the stamina to struggle again with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sweep of the current. Slowly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with infinite carefulness he drew him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self back to a precarious kneeling po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sition against the sloping pedestal base</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the I-beam. The fingers of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand explored upward, but found</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing save added inches of the slip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pery column.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If he only could see! Little hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred in his mind that even at the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this sliver of granite lay anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">promising escape; yet in the very fiber</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Toi-Yabe Tolman was that deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wedged elan of the battler; that flexi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility of ready, combative spirit which</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes emergencies and perils exactly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they come, and compresses from each</seg><seg type="columnLine">the full blood of opportunity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An opportunity to determine just</seg><seg type="columnLine">how bad really was his plight came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. He edged closer to the pillar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped from the rounded pedestal</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly losing his grip, then slowly won</seg><seg type="columnLine">back until he could hold his weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the current with bis left elbow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hand. Then he reached to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right holster. The revolver was gone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His lips set grimly, yet he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">falter. In the long, careful process of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifting back so that he could reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other gun he reflected sardonically that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if a few million thirsty animals like his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own tethered and deserted burros and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinto back there in the arid valley just</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get at this river for a vhile--up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, of course--he'd be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wade out of the damned thing!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE second Colt was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Pie lifted it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flirted it sidewise</seg><seg type="columnLine">and back to remove</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much water as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled the trigger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Click! One cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge, at least, had been ruined by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">immersion. This time his thumb drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">back the hammer and released it in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth motion. The muzzle shot red-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow fire into the dripping black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, and the explosion of the big re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver, caught and thrown back by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cramping ceiling, was deafening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Toi-Yabe did not care. He even</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold if, kid!" he cautioned again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There, only two feet above the level</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his head, ran a smooth, yard-wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge--probably a high-water mark of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some day long past, or perhaps the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remnant of a river bed which once ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isted when this stream held far greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">volume!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The problem was ticklish enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Climbing to the ledge meant mounting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sloping base of the pillar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightening upward, securing some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of hold in a crevice or outcrop 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor of the ledge. Kneeling, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one arm crooked about the upright</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock, he just could reach across and</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch the finger-tips of one hand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sharp edge. Between pillar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall below the ledge swift water</seg><seg type="columnLine">swirled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twice he essayed to stand, and both</seg><seg type="columnLine">times the impossibility of obtaining a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dependable foothold was emphasized</seg><seg type="columnLine">by bruising falls against the pillar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the water. Once only a quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">grab of both arms saved him from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing swept away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now in spite of his great reserves</seg><seg type="columnLine">of strength lie felt the dulling of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haustion. His shoulders ached. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in his watersoaked boots had</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbed into clods. He still could</seg><seg type="columnLine">move them from the knees and ankles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but sensation had departed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Freezin'!" he muttered. "Hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">yo're warmer'll I am, little feller!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaining the kneeling position again</seg><seg type="columnLine">by slow, painful degrees, he reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">down one hand carefully and unbuck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">led one of his two crossed cartridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">belts, that which held the empty hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster of his right-hand gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He slipped the fraction of an inch;</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched and froze. Then inch by inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">with infinite caution, he encircled the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">slender pillar with the strap, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding the buckle clamped between</seg><seg type="columnLine">his teeth. A leaning forward--a meet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the two ends--a quick pull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made an inarticulate noise of tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umph, one that was chopped into jig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling syllables by his irresponsible</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth. The belt was in place! It hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">slantingly in the water with the loop</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cartridges below. Toi-Yabe</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested it with one hand, found that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could slip 110 lower. Then he reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">about and loosened the viselike grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his neck, securing a sound hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the terrified, speechless child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That instant he thrust one knee into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loop, drew up the other foot, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood erect! From that position it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy enough to cross the narrow gap</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ledge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon hands and knees, little Dickie</seg><seg type="columnLine">close beside him, feeling his way upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the down-slope of the ledge, Toi-Yabe</seg><seg type="columnLine">started in the direction of the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">■where he had dropped from surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley above. Far, far up-stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be a hole in the roof of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this cavern, and light--if nothing else</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeful. It seemed too much to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect that lie could negotiate a way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point where his mishap had oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred and there manage to climb to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hole. Yet this seemed the great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est chance. Probably it was the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two made rather rapid progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a time, Toi-Yabe keeping his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand upon the outside edge and grop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing forward and sidewise with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right before going ahead. Always he</seg><seg type="columnLine">held Dickie inside. Once the ledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrowed to little more than two feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of width. Here a wedge of the rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dropped away, too. By sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, letting his boots touch the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the stream again, he managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lift himself and the boy along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken causeway, however, to the reas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suring widening beyond where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge rose a trifle. He breathed freer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The relief was short-lived. Three</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The two made rapid progress for a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">66</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FRONTIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">or four yards beyond, Toi-Yabe's left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand found a sharp right-angle in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge, and his groping right encoun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered nothingness! He inched for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, lifted out the Colt revolver. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot blazed into the inky darkness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">causing Dickie to cry out and shrink</seg><seg type="columnLine">close. During the momentary life of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that red-yellow flare Toi-Yabe saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that what he had dreaded most lay be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore him. This was the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge! True, ten or twelve yards be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond a six-inch sliver of horizontal</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock still clung to the arching tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, yet all the rest had broken away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since manifestly it was impossible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross the stream or breast the current,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could proceed no farther in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But one alternative remained, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toi-Yabe, his wide mouth tightened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">played it. He turned and slowly made</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way with the lad back through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitch blackness. Time for them did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not exist. Since they had fallen into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water he supposed several hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">had elapsed; and now, with every</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospect of another blind end to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge of comparative safety, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tortured by the picture of the suffer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing he had brought upon the child--</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffering borne uncomplainingly, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T THE break in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black, speeding sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face curved on two</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet below he</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned, cupped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and drank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then offering some</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Dickie. The water was hard with</seg><seg type="columnLine">mineral, yet it lacked even a trace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">alkaline bitterness. This showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly that for a long distance up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, at least, the river did not see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface and daylight. Though Toi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yabe never was to ascertain the fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stream likewise kept to its subter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranean channel until it mingled its sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance with that of the stern Virgin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound for a mating with the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colorado.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Time unmarked, unguessed, crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">along. When he was tolerably certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had passed the pillar which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given him access to the ledge, Toi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yabe halted and fired, desiring another</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief glimpse. There right ahead, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few yards, was the self-same pillar or</seg><seg type="columnLine">another exactly like it! Such similar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity was not probable. Toi-Yabe gri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maccd. The progress of the two was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that of a heavy lizard, yet he cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly had believed they must have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">traversed much more than this dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance. He continued the grim, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeless journey, speaking brief words</seg><seg type="columnLine">of encouragement to Dickie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reached what seemed the end, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed. A cave-in of the wall had filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ledge with loose rock. One large,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jagged chunk in particular blocked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. The remaining shots from Toi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yabe's six-gun revealed that the block-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ade extended over a width of only four</seg><seg type="columnLine">or five feet, though for all he could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">in climbing, the burdened ledge itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">might as well have given away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Methodically reloading the weapon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prospector probed forward with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand leading his charge. He soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that the risk of clinging to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">jutting as he edged about would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor chance, indeed. Loose rock sliv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers fell away, and more came from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. Instead of attempting this, Toi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yabe dug carefully with his fingers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifting out pieces of granite and drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping them in the stream. Soon he met</seg><seg type="columnLine">the large boulder. Tentatively he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrenched, and then crowded back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick alarm. With a grinding crash</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly followed by a splash the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">balanced weight of granite fell into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stream!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toi-Yabe, who had dared hope for</seg><seg type="columnLine">no such immediate success, quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized Dickie, and edged past the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon which more rock might fall at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any moment. He found himself upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a broadening, ascending curve of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge, where the low, rushing mutter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the onyx waters seemed to die away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here, though he did not pay it much</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention, the stream dived still deeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a brief arc. Along the breast of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve sheer centrifugal force threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward small whitecaps, invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dozen yards more, and then Toi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yabe stopped, quivering--and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the cold which had left his veins</seg><seg type="columnLine">there while he wrestled with the cave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in of rock. Unless hope deceived his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyesight, ahead and high on the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">side he traveled, was a faint but dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cernible streak of gray! It had to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">light; and the presence of light in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel could mean nothing save an</seg><seg type="columnLine">aperture in the ceiling--possibly just</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a break in the floor of the valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">as that one through which Toi-Yabe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the lad had come into peril!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was characteristic of the tall, lean</seg><seg type="columnLine">ex-bandit that an unexpected hope, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of causing him to rush forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an impulse of tumultuous relief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">held him quiet one interminable min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute, arm around Dickie, considering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">iThen he drew the newly loaded six-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, snapped two spoiled cartridges,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and obtained an explosion from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he saw little during the brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash, except that a ten-foot ledge in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clined upward. He rose to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks good, little feller," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm c-cold!" chattered Dickie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That second, from perhaps fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards in front and above him, a shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazed forth in answer to his own! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaden slug went pttt upon some part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rock wall, then whined on in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ricochet. Almost the same instant a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second flash and report came; where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bullet went Toi-Yabe did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. He thrust Dickie behind him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His gaze was fastened upon the broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">way gently inclining upward in a slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve; he had caught an ephemeral</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of a crouching figure there at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the slope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toi-Yabe dropped to his elbow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forcing Dickie to lie down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stay right there, pard!" he whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered. Reloading the fired chambers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the .44, he shifted his single remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing belt holster to the rear and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Indian stalk. The other man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the advantage, yet Toi-Yabe, ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed by a gnawing sympathy for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lad whose life had been thrust into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, was in 110 mood to compromise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More than once he had fought to a fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish with an opponent in the chaparral;</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bandit days were filled with such</seg><seg type="columnLine">encounters. Now with the gray light</seg><seg type="columnLine">high to the right becoming more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more plain, he was ready to exercise</seg><seg type="columnLine">every wile and kill without mercy this</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown man who obstructed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another might have cried out, at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempting parley--and surely failing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as circumstances were ordered. Toi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yabe, believing that the skulker above</seg><seg type="columnLine">would think him hugging the inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, bellied forward 011 the very brink</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the river. Now he saw vaguely the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide flat of a horizontal lie of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge, though strive as he might he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could distinguish no hint of his un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known opponent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A third shot blazed. This time Toi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yabe saw momentarily the man's head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and extended arm. Yet Toi-Yabe held</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fire. He knew now where the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">was waiting, and went for that spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a minimum of delay. Knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he himself was shielded by an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrable blackness, Toi-Yabe cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the yards swiftly but noiselessly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping to the outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The grayness was becoming more</seg><seg type="columnLine">pronounced. Toi-Yabe saw that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">must come from a ceiling aperture</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPAREJOS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">some distance beyond and to the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his quarry. It did not show up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed of the ledge, however. So, fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing a rapid approach of what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">estimated to be forty yards, Toi-Yabe</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumed his slow crawl again, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outside for the first time. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand-to-hand tussle, as this well might</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove to be, he preferred the rock wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Who could be the man who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to dispute with lead any en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">croachment upon this peculiar subter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranean preserve? What was his rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son for jealousy? Toi-Yabe, creeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, would have liked an answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to both questions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IE expected gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight to a decision</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not occur. Toi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yabe had crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least far enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought. Still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard a sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspiration of slow but jerky breathing!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then came a low groan, some mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered unintelligible words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toi-Yabe frowned. A futile de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coy! He edged toward the sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, rose to his feet. His thumb</seg><seg type="columnLine">held back the filed hammer of his six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun. He hoped grimly that it did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">misfire again from a water-soaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">cartridge when he came to the show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside in the big sunlit world a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere handful of nimbus had been over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun for a space of minutes. Alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a painfully blue Nevada sky, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud held on a while, and then gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. In another clime it might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been thought the precursor of a storm;</seg><seg type="columnLine">here it was something to be looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">and viewed with wonder. Of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">no rain was expected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toi-Yabe did not know anything ox</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cloud; yet as he inched along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting to kill a man whose hand had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired three times at him--and with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out excuse--he saw the gray light</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighten, become even intense! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad ledge gradually became limned</seg><seg type="columnLine">by reflected sunlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Toi-Yabe saw his man!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The prospector did not fire immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately--and eventually did not fire at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. The fact was that with the grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing light of the inducted sun he saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure sprawled out, face against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock and right hand limply holding a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon, far ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toi-Yabe watched, his thumb hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing back the hammer of the Colt. Thus</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he stood while long seconds ticked by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he walked forward a step, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent steps, three. After due delibera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion he reached the prone body, quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured its two revolvers and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain the man had no knife or der-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringer concealed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that Toi-Yabe looked more</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely at his antagonist, finding him</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscious. He was Sheriff Bellin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Repressing his unbounded astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, Toi-Yabe hurriedly brought up</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dickie, and then examined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded sheriff. The latter was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded twice. One bullet had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the right side rather shal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowly ; whether or not it had damaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vital organ the prospector could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">determine. The second leaden slug</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shattered Bellinger's right shin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone, and undoubtedly was more pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful if not as dangerous. The sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lost a great deal of blood. Toi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yabe, utilizing the other's own clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">for bandages and a rude compress,</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to check the flow--albeit</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the pools of blood on the rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor he doubted seriously that Stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bellinger ever would recover con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Daddy!" cried the boy, when first</seg><seg type="columnLine">he glimpsed the face of the inert man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He squirmed away from Toi-Yabe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run to the side of his idol--the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who from the first had chosen the grim</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuit of the law's vengeance rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the love he himself had helped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">create.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The hell!" gasped Toi-Yabe Tol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. This affair had grown too com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicated for even his keen abilities in</seg><seg type="columnLine">analysis. The kid belonged to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff. The sheriff had half-recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized the shoes and stockings, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently. He, Toi-Yabe. unwittingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">had imperiled the lad, only to save him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the subterranean river--and find</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the other end of the cavern Stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bellinger, ready to fight to the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasp against someone! And then, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the memory of that rapid gunfire</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard across the ridge--shooting which</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred only a short time after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff departed from Toi-Yabe's</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp. What did it all mean ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drew Dickie away, comforting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lad, assuring him that the daddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be all right after he'd had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good long sleep--phrasing hope rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than certainty. Then by tactful ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions he drew from the boy a lurid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightmarish tale of being snatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">from bed, gagged, and carried away</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a big, fat man on horseback. Toi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yabe obtained a serviceable descrip-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of that big, fat man, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth drew into a line. Haj Maddox!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What the fool's idea could have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hard to discern, yet motives now</seg><seg type="columnLine">were unimportant. Maddox once and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all had placed himself beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale of sympathy or toleration. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">justice could await him now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The running fight down the neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boring valley with the sheriff riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard in pursuit and shooting only at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the legs of Haj's fleeing animal, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order not to wound his own son, Dickie</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave with a dramatic force entirely un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious. Haj, terrified at the unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected meeting which jettisoned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme in an instant, thought only of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own escape. Riding as hard as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could force the cayuse, he came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocky, uneven ground down among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave formations, steadily losing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead over the relentless Bellinger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden idea came to the fleeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">criminal. Passing a black crevice in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hillside, one which looked like it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might drop to the bowels of the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haj bent from the saddle and tossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dickie into it. He figured Stone Bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">linger would stop, and that was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actly what the sheriff did--but for an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other reason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both men fired, and both scored</seg><seg type="columnLine">hits. Bellinger tumbled from the sad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle, while ahead of him the horse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haj Maddox stumbled and pitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlong, dying. And then, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">both men were dazed, little Dickie</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled up and climbed to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, unaware that his own father was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the creatures of this terribly</seg><seg type="columnLine">real nightmare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, Haj realized that now he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">committed. Either the sheriff and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy died right then and there, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haj could plan on stretching hemp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shots were exchanged. Bellinger was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded again, but managed to crawl</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sheltering crevice. Grinning like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wolf, Haj Maddox was satisfied. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not dream of another entrance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that cavelike hole. He settled, six-gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hand, to await the appearance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">either the boy or man. He would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in no danger; this sort of pot-shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun-fighting suited him right down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toi-Yabe did not learn all of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Dickie, yet he could surmise the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation. His face took on the ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered bronze expression well known</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his old associates of bandit days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the killer's mask. He removed his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">watersoakcd belt and gun, replacing it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the sheriff's two belts and long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barreled Remingtons. He hefted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons, saw that they were freshly</seg><seg type="columnLine">08</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FRONTIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">loaded, and then slipped them up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in their holsters. Then, caution-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Dickie to remain beside his father,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie climbed up the narrow way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">irregular opening to the sunlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ddox of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fabe felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">t the kid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ould be</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">i of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern, waiting like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bloated spider to pounce upon its</seg><seg type="columnLine">prey. The chief fact, then, to be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined, was the exact direction and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereabouts of the ambush. Just back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the shielding slate overhang which</seg><seg type="columnLine">made an elbow of the crevice at ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">level, he froze to immobility, listening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet it was not through the sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing that Toi-Yabe discovered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary information. Not a sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to him. Haj, if he were there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found a restful position, appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently, and was enjoying the anticipa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory wait.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toi-Yabe suddenly sniffed gently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Borne to him, diffused but yet pun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent, came an aroma he recognized,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one which set up within him the acute</seg><seg type="columnLine">appetite of long deprivation--cigarette</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke! The smoke reached his nos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trils, but where did it come from?</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was almost no breeze at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he suddenly tautened. A wisp</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bluish gray fumes, holding together,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted lazily across his vision, coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the left. Well, Haj was there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One time was as good as another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crouching, his muscles coiled like steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">springs, he drew both guns. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a wild, terrific shout of jeering</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumph, he leaped up like a jack-in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">the-box and alighted--running, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting! He had one brief glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Haj Maddox, back against one</seg><seg type="columnLine">houlder while his left elbow rested on</seg><seg type="columnLine">another. Maddox shot. Toi-Yabe</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot twice while scarcely on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. All three bullets went wild.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Toi-Yabe, chuckling in sinister</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion, dove behind the identical</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulder which sheltered his enemy!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've come for yore ears, Maddox!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toi-Yabe chuckled in a blood-curdling</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone. "Be sayin' yore prayers, hom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bre, if yuh got any." He went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">without cessation, the while watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagle-eyed for the slightest glimpse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the criminal who huddled on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toi-Yabe knew his man. The leap</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yell had been carefully calculated,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and successful. Now, while possessing</seg><seg type="columnLine">no real advantage in position or other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise over Maddox, Toi-Yabe played</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberately for the yellow streak he</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly believed Maddox possessed. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">the assortment of threats and promises</seg><seg type="columnLine">came about the four-foot boulder, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrinking, appalled kidnapper's nerve</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke. "I ain't got no fight with yuh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toi-Yabe!" he quavered at last. "Le's</seg><seg type="columnLine">call it quits."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No quits!" retorted Toi-Yabe. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly shot away an inch of Stetson</seg><seg type="columnLine">rim which showed for an instant at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side of the sheltering boulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Throw yore guns away, an* reach for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yuh ain't goin' to-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll count five! Then I'm cornin'!</seg><seg type="columnLine">One--two--three-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I give up!" came the yelp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror seemingly unadulterated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A pair of six-guns clanked to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks, and the green-swarthy, hatless</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and two upraised arms of Haj</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maddox appeared. An odd, desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam shone from his black beads of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, nevertheless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a loss to account for it for a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond, Toi-Yabe studied his prisoner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he noted that Haj's hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">held aloft palms backward--and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled grimly. An old trick, but good</seg><seg type="columnLine">at times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A'right. Come here," he bade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming to let his revolvers droop</seg><seg type="columnLine">carelessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed to be what Haj had hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see. With a sound between a grunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and squeal, he suddenly yanked down</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That same split second a slug from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the big Remington's smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his navel. The stratagem had</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed. Haj's palmed derringer ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploded, indeed, just as he buckled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming, but the bullet merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">smudged a whitish streak upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock between Toi-Yabe's feet and rico-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheted away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Merciless, grim, Toi-Yal&gt;e lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead body of Maddox and dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">it far down the valley, dropping it</seg><seg type="columnLine">without ceremony. Then he returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Dickie and his father.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bellinger was conscious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did yuh get him?" he queried in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toi-Yabe nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's out there--the only hombre I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever hope to kill I wouldn't cover up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the buzzards!" he added. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">now I'll get yuh a drink. I want yuh</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take it easy. The kid here an' me</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan to move my camp over thisaway</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so we can Lake care of yuh right. Is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that O. K.?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The trip over and back, and then the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ensuing days of Bellinger's early con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">valescence, were strange days indeed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the career of Toi-Yabe Tolman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Shamelessly from the first he made a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">partner of the five-year-old, though</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">realizing the idolatry of Stone which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">occupied nine-tenths of the lad's heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Little by little Toi-Yabe learned the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whole pathetic story of the kilts and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the home-made chaparejos.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Once when alone he clenched a fist</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and shook it at the back of the sheriff,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">who now was sitting up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Damn yuh!" muttered Toi-Yabe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I'd take pleasure in belting yuh a cou-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ple, myself, if yuh was well! A father</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--huh!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But then, while Dickie had the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">parent he worshipped all to himself</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and signs of a different attitude were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plain in the expression of Bellinger,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Toi-Yabe occupied himself mysteri-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ously. He pretended to be prospect-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing a far canyon branching from this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">valley. Actually, with some of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">own clothes and one of Bellinger's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">worn bearskin chaps, he was making</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strange upward and downward passes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a coarse needle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then came a day when he called the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">boy and made him don a certain cos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tume-complete, in imitation of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">daddy's, even to the belts and holsters</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--the latter cut down from those of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Maddox. Then he made the impatient</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dickie await call, while he squatted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down beside the sheriff.

Of course, with the Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, not at all are we limited to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife by custom. Oh, no! But then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, it is not wise to cross the will of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a determined woman, and Winking</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bear was rather of the belief, in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, that his wife would not like it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though this old widow Roaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief was so homely that a buzzard</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never have lit on her carcass!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Now of a truth, and the Sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">hears me say it, you have made a mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take!'

About 1867, just before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stocking of the ranges began in</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnest, the range in certain Texas</seg><seg type="columnLine">counties would support three hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">cows to the square mile, or one to each</seg><seg type="columnLine">two acres.

In the effort to increase the</seg><seg type="columnLine">value of range lands, the Forest Ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vice today is advocating a return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the method of the buffaloes.

As the owner of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">little sorrel beauty, The Denton Mare,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been known far and wide;</seg><seg type="columnLine">known and liked immensely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was not, altogether, that he was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rider without peer; a dead shot with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winchester or Colt; leader in any dar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing enterprise of "the boys," a master</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowboy. Nor was his popularity born</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly of generosity and a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough chivalry, though these qualities</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had in large measure. Others have</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the every characteristic of Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bass, yet have waked no such fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">loyalty as this stocky, dark-eyed cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy knew; such admiration in Cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, where he is a heroic figure even</seg><seg type="columnLine">today.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From friends in Denton Sam learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that an Ogallala man, an ex-express</seg><seg type="columnLine">messenger, had suspected the six cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys of the train robbery, though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officials had not been suspicious of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as, in the days after the robbery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they mingled with sheriffs and mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shals and railroad detectives in Ogal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lala. He had trailed the party south-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, this ex-messenger, and spying</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon their camp had heard them dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuss the crime; had learned their plans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their real names; had even seen them</seg><seg type="columnLine">handling bright new gold-pieces of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">year 1877. His knowledge he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">communicated to the officials. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">law wanted Sam Bass and Jack Davis</seg><seg type="columnLine">--wanted them hard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So to Jack Davis, hiding in the elm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottoms, Sam Bass took back the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the search and the large reward of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered for them. To the authenticated</seg><seg type="columnLine">report of the death of Collins and Ilef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fridge, two of their gang, he added</seg><seg type="columnLine">the account of the killing of another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Berry, in his home town, Mexico,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Missouri, where Berry's shining new</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold-pieces had connected him with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That leaves just three out 0' the</seg><seg type="columnLine">six," said Sam. "Seems 01' Dad Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derwood never went to Missoury with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Berry. Anyway, they never got</seg><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I told you we'd better hit for South</seg><seg type="columnLine">America!" complained Jack Davis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose bump of discretion seems to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been well-developed. " 'Tain't too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late now. Let's high-tail it, Sam. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't buck all this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, what's to be scared of?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">scoffed Sam, those large white teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing in his famous grin. "Don't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	know this-here country like the palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">o' my hand? Don't be losin' your</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve, Jack! We'll just stick here an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">be damned to 'em to catch us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Jack Davis was beyond persua-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. He never had thought such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hornets' nest would be aroused by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">U. P. robbery. While planning it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Collins had stressed the large cliance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their never being recognized. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">SAM BASS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be "on the dodge" in the face of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">widespread and earnest search broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">Davis' nerve. So from the elm-bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toms outside of Denton, Jack Davis</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode hell-for-leather; rode out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture entirely. Whether he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">South America, or started afresh un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der another name in the States there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no authentic report. But certain it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is that neither he nor Old Dad Under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood ever paid the penalty, officially,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the crime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AM BASS, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left Denton</seg><seg type="columnLine">that spring a lik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, bull-headed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but honest cowboy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came home a fam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous outlaw, fit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mention with Jesse</seg><seg type="columnLine">James and the Youngers. Nor did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack apologists. Texas had always</seg><seg type="columnLine">held itself somewhat aloof from na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional affairs; what a man did else-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where seldom worried the Texans, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">long as he obeyed the code in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now it was complained that Texan</seg><seg type="columnLine">authorities were pulling Nebraska</seg><seg type="columnLine">chestnuts from what might well be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot fire; that Sam Bass was being per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">secuted in this state when he had com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted no crime whatsoever against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sovereignty of Texas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Meanwhile, moving through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-known county with a surety, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prescience, almost, that baffled his pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suers, Sam Bass gained a following.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Attracted by his reputation--perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">by thought of that not-yet-spent ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand in shiny gold-pieces of '77--</seg><seg type="columnLine">men appeared unobtrusively in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elm-bottoms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">So came Henry Underwood, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arkansas Johnson, Sebe Barnes, Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murphy, young Frank Jackson, Pipes</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herndon; later, two or three others</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so well known joined the gang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daring, dangerous men, some of theses</seg><seg type="columnLine">men with records as gun-fighters, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard characters when "on the prod."</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Sam Bass was their undisputed</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not long could such a group be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent to ride into the little hamlets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denton and Dallas and Tarrant Coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties, to "belly up to the bar" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">amuse themselves with occupations so</seg><seg type="columnLine">mild as the mere downing of Old Jor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dan and shooting at marks--in or out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the saloons--and talking of past do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. The logical thought came to Bass</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could be hunted no more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was. He had committed no crime</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Texas, yet Texan officers chased</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He had the name; it would cost</seg><seg type="columnLine">him little or nothing to get the game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gang's first job was the robbery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a Texas and Pacific train at Eagle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ford, some seven miles west of Dal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">las. It was a simple job to stop the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train near the sleepy little farming vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage and go through it. Thereafter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two or three similar robberies were</seg><seg type="columnLine">executed with no features particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting. Considering the numbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Sam Bass' gang, the profit was</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, averaging perhaps five hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars per man in each robbery. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not his train-robberies which give</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interest to the career of Sam Bass</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon which his tradition rests, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">masterly fashion in which for months</seg><seg type="columnLine">he tied sheriffs' posses and Texas Ran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers into knots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John B. Jones was Adjutant-Gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral of Texas during 1877-8 and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanded the Texas Rangers. Jones</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an able and experienced officer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the train-robberies of Sam Bass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were becoming very frequent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">roused him to unusual energy. Hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing visited Denton, Dallas and the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounding country personally, he organ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized a new company of thirty Rangers</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Dallas, giving the command to Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain June Peak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To this company was given the spe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cific duty of capturing the Sam Bass</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gang, but figuratively, if not actually,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam mocked Captain Peak and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumsy, inexperienced recruits. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that, counting Rangers and sher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iffs' posses, at least a hundred men</seg><seg type="columnLine">now took the trail of Texas' train-</seg><seg type="columnLine">robber premier. Yet tradition has it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">also, that during his time "on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodge" Sam himself was rarely, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, driven out of the three adjoining</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a simple jok to stop the train</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">counties of Denton, Dallas and Tar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rant. The wooded nature of the coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try in this locality made it simple for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to elude the blundering officers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not always did the gang hold to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, now. Bass' second-in-com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand, the daredevil Arkansas John-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, was killed at Salt Creek in Wise</seg><seg type="columnLine">County by Captain Peak's Rangers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Pipes Herndon and Jim Mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phy were captured. Sam himself, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sebe Barnes and young Frank Jack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, were the only members out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jail, and they hugged the elm-bottoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Denton County. The handwriting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the wall became clear now. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodging might go on almost indefin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itely, but the nerve-racking strain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling on them all; they were weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. Sam decided to leave his beloved</seg><seg type="columnLine">north Texas and in Mexico or some</seg><seg type="columnLine">other foreign country make a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To General Jones, by this time, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intent to capture or kill Sam Bass had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become an obsession. We may shrug</seg><seg type="columnLine">away mention of stool pigeons and</seg><seg type="columnLine">traitors as necessary units of police</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment, but by Texans generally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and especially by the cowboys, who re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garded Sam Bass as one of themselves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the methods of General Jones were</seg><seg type="columnLine">given no fancy names whatever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim Murphy was the tool chosen by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones. To Murphy, then in jail await-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Federal trial for robbery of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mails, Jones went with the offer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">freedom on condition that he execute a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain plan which would result in Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bass' betrayal into the officers' hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murphy, to give him the tiny modicum</seg><seg type="columnLine">of credit one may, at first rejected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposal, even though life imprison-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment seemed its alternative. But Jones</seg><seg type="columnLine">was persistent, and finally threats and</seg><seg type="columnLine">promises together overcame Murphy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembrance of Sam Bass' many</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindnesses to the needy Murphy clan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Murphy zvas arrested and then re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> leased 011 bail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He jumped his bond at Tyler and then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> took the train for Terrell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But Major Jones had posted Jim and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that was all a stall;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JTwas only a plan to capture Sam be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fore the coming fall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So runs a verse of the old ballad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the clear, unquibbling judgment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the outdoors, it tells unmincingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tale of Jones' plan to trap Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Murphy, having been released on</seg><seg type="columnLine">bail supplied by certain men in Jones'</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence, jumped his bond and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FRONTIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">great hue-and-cry was raised. As had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been planned., it preceded Jim Murphy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Denton, where he rejoined Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bass, Sebe Barnes and Frank Jackson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But friends of Bass and Barnes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">written warning that this looked to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a snare; that the bondsmen were prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably creatures of General Jones. Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fronted with these letters, for his very</seg><seg type="columnLine">life Murphy played his part in mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terly fashion--without, however, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vincing Sam and Barnes.

Now Frank took Murphy's part,</seg><seg type="columnLine">declaring his belief in the traitor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">good faith.

In the Texas</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that day these words were enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to insure feverish activity in any town,</seg><seg type="columnLine">small or large. On no account, Jones</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisted, were the town officers to at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt an arrest before the arrival of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reynolds and his Rangers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RIDAY, July tq,</seg><seg type="columnLine">1878. Reynolds'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Company E, Fron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tier Battalion, Tex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Rangers, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the one hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred fifty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">from San Saba to</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Round Rock at top speed and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">early afternoon pitched camp outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of town. Sam Bass, with Barnes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson and Murphy, were also</seg><seg type="columnLine">camped upon the town's outskirts. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlaws rode into town for a last</seg><seg type="columnLine">check-up of the robbery's details. Mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phy, sensing the final scene so soon to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be played, upon some pretext dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">l&gt;ehind. So Bass and Barnes and young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frank Jackson came up to Copprel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">store together. As they went inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were noticed by the two local</seg><seg type="columnLine">deputy sheriffs, Moore and Grimes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stared hard at the three dusty</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers, but apparently without</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that the trio were the famous</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlaws they were awaiting, upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose heads were placed rewards by</seg><seg type="columnLine">states and railroads and express com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panies. When Sam Bass' broad shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders had disappeared within the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moore turned to Grimes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think those fellows got guns on,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think so, too," nodded Grimes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm goin' in an' search 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lie went in, a hero and a martyr, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a way; but history as written by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool and practical judgment of range-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land in fifty years makes him, also, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more so, pretty much "plain damned</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool." For he took none of the me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanical precautions of the wary peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer confronting strangers. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grimes stepped inside, Moore trailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to the door and stood blinking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At Grimes' entrance the trio at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter whirled instinctively. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long instant deputy sheriff and outlaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think you fellows got guns on,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Grimes, a trifle belligerently. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin' to search you," he added, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead silence that greeted his speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something about the silent group</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">must have Struck a warning note with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in him. For now, gun hand going</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Colt butt, he began to back</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the door, where Moore still</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood gaping at the play inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, we got guns!" snarled Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bass suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if the phrase were a signal, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun and Barnes' and Jackson's flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. There was a rolling roar, deaf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening in the confined space of Cop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prel's store, as three Colts flung heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets into the luckless deputy. Grimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered under the triple impact, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to back out. Moore had</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped aside and Grimes reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewalk, to crash forward upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. After him sprang the outlaws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensing a trap, scenting disaster.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moore was shot through the lungs as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he snatched belatedly at his Colt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ranger Dick Ware was sitting in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barber shop almost next door, waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a shave. The heavy three-in-one</seg><seg type="columnLine">report from the store jerked him to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. Automatically his Colt came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he stepped into the street, to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost face to face with the outlaws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who stood staring down at the bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the sidewalk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An utterly fearless man, this Ran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger Dick Ware, worthy exponent of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heroic traditions of the service.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Odds of three to one might well have</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent a genuinely brave officer tack in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors to fire from cover. But Ware</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran toward them, his 45 flipping up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a hitching post on the side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk and bullets from Bass' gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked splinters from it that struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ware in the face. But he came on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing rapidly. A bullet struck Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bass' cartridge belt, broke two shells,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mushrooming, tore his right kid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney to ribbons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> General Jones, at this moment com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up-street, heard the staccato rattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the firing and came on the run as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bass and the others backed toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">their horses. Jones had but a small-</seg><seg type="columnLine">calibre double-action Colt, but he en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the duel blithely, joining Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ware. The other two Rangers who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to Round Rock with Ware</seg><seg type="columnLine">now ran up also, while from doorways</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down the street appeared armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizens to open fire upon the trio by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barnes was shot dead, Bass was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mortally wounded. Only young Frank</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson now stood erect, and, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bravery equal to Dick Ware's, he kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the outlaws' end of the firing while</seg><seg type="columnLine">with left hand he unhitched Sam Bass'</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse. Bullets fairly rained around</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from all directions as he helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">SAM BASS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Bass into the saddle, then sprang upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out through Old Round Rock gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loped the two frightened horses, Bass</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeling in the saddle, Frank Jackson</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding him up. Jim Murphy, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">traitor, pale, shaken, stricken by we</seg><seg type="columnLine">know not what torture of remorse, or,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, none at all, saw the two escap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the rest of that day Bass and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson vanished from sight. Posses</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ranger detachments scoured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicinity, but not until Saturday morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing did Rangers find Sam Bass, alone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">near death, lying beneath a large oak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He admitted his identity and made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jackson had insisted upon remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his dying leader, but Bass--game,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unselfish to the last, the cowboys' ideal</seg><seg type="columnLine">now as he had been in brighter days--</seg><seg type="columnLine">was equally insistent that Frank save</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. So, having made Bass as</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable as possible, unwillingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson escaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taken into Round Rock, Bass re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived the best attention local medicos</seg><seg type="columnLine">could administer.

He joined a wagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">train, but made no close friends and</seg><seg type="columnLine">told no man of his destination. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fort Laramie he fell out of the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">procession, gave his wagon and har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness into the keeping of the half-breed</seg><seg type="columnLine">traders, secured a supply of dried buf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">falo meat, packed his mules and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a casual farewell to the loungers</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the gate of the stockade, headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the Spirit Hills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, without mishap or the faint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est sign of danger, he had penetrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the heart of the mysterious moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quietly enjoying the pristine beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties unfolding before his eyes, he rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly into a great park that lay like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast green robe spread carelessly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the black, forbidding walls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lounged back in his roomy, flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">horned saddle, rested his double-bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reled muzzle-loader across his thighs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and considered the work before him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would make his camp beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, convenient to both wood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. He would erect a rude shelter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly a lean-to against that white</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock, upthrust at the forest's edge, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty monolith glittering against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark background of pines. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be easy, too, to construct a fireplace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock and mud, sheltering it against</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden showers. He would get up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply of dry wood. He would live</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortably, while he searched for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream his uncle had named Pactolus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had enough provisions to last him</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the summer. There would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks when, except for salt, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have to touch his reserves. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">country was thronging with game, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be plenty of wild fruit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strawberries, Juneberries, choke-cher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ries and raspberries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What a home could be built up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this opening! He visioned a log</seg><seg type="columnLine">house built against the great white</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock. The rock would serve for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of a fireplace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the rich, black soil, potatoes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabbages and oats would flourish. Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man could have a home here that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make a king envy him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Plenty of good grass for, say, fif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen or twenty cows. One, Old Spot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, would wear a bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reluctantly he returned to reality.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His dream had been a very pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. But it was only a dream--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream that might never come true, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">all at once the silence, seemingly inten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sified by all the softly-blended voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising from the heart of the wilder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, suddenly oppressed him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a desire to hear some familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound, though it be but that of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, and he turned in his saddle to</seg><seg type="columnLine">admonish his two pack mules who,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted by the tender young grass, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been loitering by the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, you jacks-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the two mules were not snatch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing greedy mouthfuls of the juicy</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass. Instead, with heads held high</seg><seg type="columnLine">and long ears aslant, they stood mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionless, eyes fixed on something in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest far to their right. Presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">they snorted in unison and trotted up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the horse, as if seeking comfort and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reassurance from the animal they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">so blindly followed through gloomy</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyons and dim forest aisles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come along, you two," remonstrat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the youth.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">amid the shifting lights and shadows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could distinguish no form of men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ace. Possibly the mules had scented a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear, and were staging the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm. But now the horse had caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of the dread Something. Head</seg><seg type="columnLine">high, he gave vent to a long, whistling</seg><seg type="columnLine">snort. The youth could feel the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles tense and quiver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Old Faithful sees it, too," he mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced down at his gun to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure the caps were on the nipples.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whatever it was, he was prepared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">receive it. Two shots in the rifle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">six in each of his heavy pistols.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UDDENLY he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">something moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">far to his right;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, at last, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shifting lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shadows of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest, three riders</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged. They were not coming di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly toward him, but were obliquing</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the white rock. Then, quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning his head, he saw another trio</seg><seg type="columnLine">of riders emerging from the forest to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his left, tiny figures scarcely a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">high. And then he saw, far back on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his trail, two moving dots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">80</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FRONTIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indians!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were bent on surrounding him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on forcing him to make a stand in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelterless opening. This was his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian attack, but his self-control and</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical sense did not desert him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment he considered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feasibility of making a stand in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening, but his uncle had told him of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Indian's "circle of death," and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that his only hope lay in mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a race for the great white rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearby. No fear clamored in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart; he was as calm as when he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">making the double-barreled gun in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little shop, yet he was conscious of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage irritation. The Indians would</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure his outfit. Each carefully se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lected article was now priceless, for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be replaced without a long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">toilsome journey. He had no hatred</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the speeding warriors, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the Anglo-Saxon's attachment to</seg><seg type="columnLine">property. For what was his, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight. It might be only a handful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">salt, but, if it was his, he would fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With difficulty he held in his wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">and frantic horse. Yet, as they got</seg><seg type="columnLine">under way, the mules developed as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonishing speed, and he gave Faithful</seg><seg type="columnLine">thfe reins. Closely followed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mules, the youth sped across the open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, passed far ahead of the obliquing</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines of warriors, and plunged through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the willows. Faithful cleared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream at one bound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reached the shelter of the rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung himself from his horse, and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time the voice of the double-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barreled rifle, with crashing reverbera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, smote the silence of the Spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nearest trio halted abruptly, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ounce ball raised a warning spurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dirt far in front of them. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">trios then rode swiftly toward the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of the opening and disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of a great clump of willows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aletes watchcd the two advancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">along his trail until they, too, disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared back of the willows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spurt of dust Iiad told him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were not within the range of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle, and he resolved to hold his fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">until sure of hitting a horse or a rider.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What were they doing back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">willows? The delay strained his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves far more than the thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the numerical odds against him. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't they attack? He was half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded to move on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back of him was a tangle of brush.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond the brush, a long opening be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the pines seemingly led into an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other park. The rock, its inner walls</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">forming a great triangle, afforded shel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter on two sides for himself and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock. Out from the rock ran natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">barricades of stone. Perhaps, if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced on, he would not soon find an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other such a natural breastwork. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">placed his ammunition within easy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reach, and awaited the next move of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Indians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It was plain that none of them pos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sessed a gun. The great rifle was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">true, and possessed tremendous shock-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing power.

Their youth was indicat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ed by the faultless symmetry of their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lithe bodies, the barely perceptible rip-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ple of muscle under their bronzed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">skins, the easy resiliency of their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">movements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They wore moccasins, thigh leggins</seg><seg type="columnLine">and breech-cloths more to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratches and bruises than for protec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion against wind, sun and rain.

He saw two warriors spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear of their floundering ponies and</seg><seg type="columnLine">run in zigzag fashion for the cover of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the willows.

His beard, black and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bristly, grew within a half-inch of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, and his eyebrows were a straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">black bar. Between his eyebrows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hair line was scarcely a finger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breadth of forehead.

Joe helped Aletes</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the saddle. They moved up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of the little column.

Yep, a man should stick to</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he knows how to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aletes made no reply to Joe's chat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, and yet he wondered why the lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle man had not questioned him. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was yet to learn that, while Joe was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chronic spiller of words, he never</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked direct questions. The frontiers-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man might volunteer information, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was careful not to pry into any</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's private affairs. He simply liked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The youth saw that, temporarily at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">least, he would have to give up his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quest of the stream his uncle had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">named Pactolus. He might return to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">civilization and secure a new outfit, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that was too far in the future to give</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With Joe leading the way, they fol-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lowed the stream down until it opened</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mubsley found himself deserted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out into a great park.

Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Squeaky, take your mashed paw down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the crick, and after this don't let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind blow in your mouth. And don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">try no more tricks with my pard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">either, or I'll take you in hand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Muttering imprecations, Squeaky</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up his rifle and sought the creek</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lave his "mashed paw" in the cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aletes ignored Squeaky. So far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was concerned the incident was</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed. But to Squeaky's saurian</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind the incident was not closed. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as he recovered the use of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, he flung up his rifle. But Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ready. Even as Squeaky pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">trigger, Never-fail spoke. Joe had</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended to kill. Killing a man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never disturbed the conscience of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little frontiersman, who, while he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever loyal to the man he selected as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">partner, was as bloodthirsty as a wea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sel. For some time he had wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill Squeaky. He could offer no rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. Squeaky had always roused in</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the desire to kill. Thus, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had what seemed to him a good ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuse, he let Never-fail speak his senti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. But the lead struck Squeaky's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, and incidentally smashed his trig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger finger close to the knuckle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gripped the wrist of his wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and hopped about wildly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now you've done it," he wailed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thinly, as Joe sauntered down to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My finger's gone--my finger's gone!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure she's gone," said Joe calm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly taking full marksmanship credit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it was an accidental hit. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">allers git what I shoot at. I aimed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">git a finger, and I got it. After this</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I tell you to leave my young pard</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, you'll think twict before cuttin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose at him. Next time I'll put lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">through your heart. Git back and let</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prayerful fix you up. He'll tie up</seg><seg type="columnLine">your paw and put goose grease on it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was little comment. To the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frontiersmen the incident seemed triv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ial. They left Squeaky to his whining</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the nursing of his maimed hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and resumed their labors. Squeaky's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet had passed through a corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fringed collar of Aletes' buckskin</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt. He dismissed the incident from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind. The fat man was now help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less ; he had lost his trigger-finger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no call for further thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe gave no thought to Squeaky, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond regretting that his bullet had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the big fellow's heart. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did think of the two echoing rifle shots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The canqon was like a funnel to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Injuns," he muttered.

"We will</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon be down to bedrock. Surely no</seg><seg type="columnLine">man can expect to gather up a load of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nuggets in a half day's work. Still, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not for me to say.

Di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luting the alcohol with water, the hardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">borderers swigged it as they would tea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a short time they were roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk.

Again the robed fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure struck the Indian, and then seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">his legs and dragged him to the far</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the tepee. The next moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">the youth felt a knife sever his bonds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and caught the warning whisper, "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little frontiersman hauled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">partner to his feet and wrapped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">robe of the dead Indian about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Straight ahead to the crick," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered.

Covered from head to foot with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the robe, he made a slow exit from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tepee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dogs, as he stalked toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creek, gave him several thrills.

The dancing and excitement</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the barking of the dogs seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">trivial and commonplace. Robed fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures were passing to and fro constant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly.

He turned away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her. She put her hands over her</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart and ran toward the camp, burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with shame. She had approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">a warrior in the dark, supposing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was seeking a maiden, and had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurned. For days she would hang</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head and look at no man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The youth's one desire now was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel the cooling waters of the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain stream, yet he knew that he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">not halt until he was out of hearing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noises of the camp. Without mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hap, he passed through the protecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom of the cottonwoods and slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the willows that lined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creek. It took all his will power to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wade the stream, for his throat mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles were jerking for a gulp of the cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. But he resolutely pressed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the far bank until he was out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing of the din of the camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now and then a rattlesnake buzzed</seg><seg type="columnLine">YELLOW IHOX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">91</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly. For once he welcomed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buzzing of the hidden snakes. Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not likely to be prowling through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gloomy tangle of willows infested</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rattlesnakes. Warily he slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the willows, and came out on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little grassy bank. There he threw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">robe into the rushing current, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked off his boots and buckskin shirt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, with a great sigh of pleasure, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped into the cool water, and sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">down until the little waves splashed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. When a liitle of the water had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked its way down his throat, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought he could hear his blood fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">singing for joy. His body soaked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reviving fluid like a dry sponge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, he fought back the desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulp his fill of the cold, sweet water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinking only enough to dull his thirst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he made a bundle of his shirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and boots, tied the sleeves around his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck, and waded into the rushing cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent. to float luxuriously in the foam</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smother. The cool flood, fed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain springs, allayed the fever in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wound and eased the pain of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacerated wrists. After his long hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">of suffering, the rushing water seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to caress and to soothe his every nerve</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to remove every physical and men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal irritation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lightly and swiftly the current car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried him.

He experienced some</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty in trimming his billy-goat</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard with his hunting knife, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally cut it down to a stubble. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he applied the paints of White Buffalo</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his face and hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IIUS disguised, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Running Wolf's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tepee and effected</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aletes* release.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, to give Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty of time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape, he stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the tepee to confront a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">young warriors who were approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, evidently bent on some nocturnal</seg><seg type="columnLine">devilment. Among them was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Panther, carrying Aletes' double-bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reled gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is not good," said the Panther,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that the white man whose gun I now</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold should live through the night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The slayer of Miniomni should die</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the sun shows his face."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Such is not the will of Petuspa,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said another.

As the Panther turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, seeking his approval and sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port, Joe's quick mind conjured up an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holding his head low like a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">communing with his medicine, he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sign meaning "wait." The Panther</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated, but Joe still barred his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the prisoner's tepee. Before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Indian could overcome his awe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the medicine-man, Joe had signed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prisoner should be killed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Panther--at which a light of fierce joy</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed on the Indian's face--but that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until morning, he was to be left un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe waited anxiously when the mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage was finished.

For,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite Joe's perfect familiarity with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Dakota tongue, he dared not speak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Panther would know it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Buffalo's voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is well," said the Panther.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe turned abruptly and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily toward the distant cotton-</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods. He passed many robed fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures, but was not annoyed by the dogs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apparently the scent of his Indian cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tume dulled the suspicions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prowling curs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once in the gloom of the cotton-</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods, he sprang forward into a run.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaining the bank of the creek, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged into the stream and discarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the robe and horrible wig. He paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">long enough to scrub his head vigor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously, and then crossed the creek and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped through the willows and brush</seg><seg type="columnLine">and into the open country. Apparent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly tireless, he trotted through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom, a wild figure that might easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been taken for an Indian. As a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of fact he was far more a crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of the wild than the Indian, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">far more deadly. To the Indian's nat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ural cunning, he added the thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers of the white man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was soon wading the creek oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">site the point where he had hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Faithful.

You</seg><seg type="columnLine">will understand all this better, when I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">recall to your mind a thing that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">obviously knew but overlooked. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">is: Oklahoma, the original territory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was opened to settlement in April</seg><seg type="columnLine">1889. The Cherokee Strip was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">slice of land that lay l&gt;etween the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of Oklahoma and the south line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Kansas. It was claimed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cherokee Indians as an outlet to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting grounds to the westward, over</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they could travel to and fro</seg><seg type="columnLine">without crossing the reservations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">other Indians. It was commonly called</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cherokee Outlet. This little strip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of land was not ceded to the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States Government until 1893, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more than four years after the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture of old Bent Rabom's clan that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Strip, and several other small res-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ervations, were opened to settlement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Compared to the original opening of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oklahoma, the opening of the Strip</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed up about like a country dog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight compared to breaking the Hin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denburg Line. By that time the Gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment had learned how to handle</seg><seg type="columnLine">such things. There never could be but</seg><seg type="columnLine">one occurrence like the opening of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Original Oklahoma.

In the longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">models such as the Colt's Frontier pattern</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Bisley Model with the seven-inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrels, the tip must hang almost to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knee cap. As these guns are close to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot in length it is easily understood why</seg><seg type="columnLine">this is neccssarv. In other words, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon must be lifted vertically a foot be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore it can be leveled, even from the hip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When one is in a hurry, as is invariably the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case when the weapon is needed, he is very</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely to attempt to level the weapon before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tip of the muzzle is clear of the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the holster--a loss of valuable time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Numberless funerals might have had differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent principals but for this one little mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take. So much for the necessity of carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the gun very low when on the right side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now then let us look at the arguments</seg><seg type="columnLine">against this position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the first place it is extremely trouble-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some to have several pounds of hardware</seg><seg type="columnLine">bumping and pounding at your leg every</seg><seg type="columnLine">time a violent or even quick move is made.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The motion of a galloping horse will cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun to beat the leg black and blue in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day's time, unless strapped very tight to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg itself. Should the animal decide to buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">--which seems to be the constitutional right</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all Western cayuses--the gun is not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hindrance but is very likely to jump out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the holster and drop to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Your range waddie mounts from the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the horse, standing facing the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite way from that in which the horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">is facing. Well forward by the left shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. This is a range bred necessity. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessens the temptation for the brute to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hind foot too freely. The left foot is</seg><seg type="columnLine">then placcd in the stirrup. The right hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">grips the horn or pommel. The rider swings</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right leg over the cantle of the saddle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The right foot describes an almost perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">half circle. If the animal plunges forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which happens most of the time, the motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">assists the rider into the saddle, instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flinging him to the rear as would be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case when mounting English fashion. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">then for the relation of the six-shooter to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. When the gun is carried on the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and low, unless it is tied securely in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster it will slip out at that point in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement when the rider's right thigh is</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher than the torso. If the gun is tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the holster--as I've witnessed some green-</seg><seg type="columnLine">horns do--and unless the holster is tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly to the leg, the force of the swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the saddle brings the gun backward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the seating is effected your hero is</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting on his gun. Very uncomfortable, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say the least--especially if the bronc gives</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few stiff-legged buck-jumps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now then as to the position on the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hip, slightly to the front, grip pointing for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, as did Mr. Grinstead's hero in "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master Squatter." This position is used by</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the old cowmen that I know. And I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised on the range. The reasons arc simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">and practical to range uses. This brings</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weapon fairly high at the waistline.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thereby lessening the tendency to flop</seg><seg type="columnLine">around like a sheep's tail when the wearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">moves quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It takes but one movement after the hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">falls on the grip to bring it out in a para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bola shaped curve and pointed at the target.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All one motion. The front sight or muzzle</seg><seg type="columnLine">never catches in the holster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In mounting, being on the left side it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">never inverted, thereby lessening the possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility of dropping out of the holster. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that the foregoing are a few at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the very good reasons why the left side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">butt forward, muzzle pointing down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, is the most popular.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have seen the six-gun worn on the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and well down on the leg by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty fast men. But they were always</seg><seg type="columnLine">afoot. Usually gamblers and saloon toughs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To my memory I have never seen a mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowman carry his gun in this manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I own and use one of the seven-inch bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reled Frontier pattern Colt 45's myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This particular arm was made in 1872 for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the U.

Have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known many Western types of citizen--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowboy, prospcctor, miner, saloonman, gam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bler, badman, rustler, train-robber, etc. J.</seg><seg type="columnLine">E. Grinstead is right about packing a gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the left side as described, but only cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain ones do so. Many gunmen packed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun on the right hip and shot from the hip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the low-hung holster was in use, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wearer would tie the lower end of the holster</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the leg to keep the gun from jamming</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a quick draw was needed. The low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung was to give the arm more freedom</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wider sweep; but it was discovered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a keen man-killer that a lot of lost motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">was attached to the low-hung, and he devised</seg><seg type="columnLine">the belt holster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hip-fire holster is attached to belt</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a single rivet, so as to allow holster</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pivot with an upward motion. The end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of holster is cut off enough to allow muzzle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gun to protrude; a chunk is cut out</seg><seg type="columnLine">around trigger-guard to allow insertion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger. Hipshots rarely drew gun from</seg><seg type="columnLine">scabbard, for the. reason that the target was</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually but a few feet distant, making a</seg><seg type="columnLine">miss almost impossible. Some of these "hip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots" were very deadly. Of course "two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun" shooters used both hips and many were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambidextrous where a single gun was used,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but when both draws were made simultan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eously, the right hand took the right-hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun and the left the left--no crossing over</seg><seg type="columnLine">as in a single draw, and the handles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed back instead of front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many saloon men, bartenders, gamblers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sports and rounders carried the Colt gtin</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a holster or belt, shoving it down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left hip, with handle to front--between</seg><seg type="columnLine">waistband and body, using the little hinged</seg><seg type="columnLine">clip that is in the right shoulder open as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">projection to hang onto the waistband. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have known some to wear a gun in the waist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">band on the right hip with handle pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. These were what is known as "snap</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooters." The gun is drawn with a hinge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like movement of the arm, as though closing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the shot fired from in front of the hip</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little and a trifle away from it. Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">gives the wrist free play to move the gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a weaving motion. This cannot be done</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the "liipshot" through the scabbard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another "snapshot" is to raise the gun up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and backward over the shoulder, bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it down in a sweeping motion onto the tar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">get, pulling the trigger the moment of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact of sight and target. This is popular</seg><seg type="columnLine">in shooting at running objects, but has too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much lost motion for rapid action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many cowboys pack the gun on the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hip to the rear when on foot, and a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">further in front when riding, so as not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">chafe the cantle of the saddle. Many pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun in a holster on the side of the pom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mel when riding, and inside the shirt on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left side when walking, using waistband</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a support. Many officers of the law</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried a gun in a scabbard in the hip poc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ket right. Some wore regulation belt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster. I packed a gun as a cowboy on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hip; as officer 011 the left side, handle</seg><seg type="columnLine">front; never in hip-pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having the gun 011 the left hip--or right--</seg><seg type="columnLine">is an advantage to a two-handed man, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big advantage to a right-handed shooter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided it isn't known that he is right-</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed. For most who are not in tlie know</seg><seg type="columnLine">would expect the wielder to use the hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">most convenient to the gun. The "cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach" has fooled many a one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, I think habit has a lot to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with how a gun is toted. One of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly killers I knew was an officer of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">law, a Texan. He carried an old wooden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">handled forty-five in his coat pocket. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed his last man in Williams, Arizona,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the man had shot at him twice, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet going through liis hat, the other wild.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He deliberately gave the man a chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">96</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FRONTIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot in order to have an excuse for killing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and he did kill him twice; that is, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired two shots, either of which would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused almost instant death.
