How, on going to Nan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tanach next day, they had found set within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inner of its three titanic terraces, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slab of stone, gray and cold and strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">repellent to the touch.

Of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts to force it, and of the vigil that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night when Stanton was taken and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">"like a corpse in which flamed a god and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a devil" in the embrace of the Dweller</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the shattered walls of Tanach, van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishing at last through the moon door, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">as had Thora.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew were six huge, chattering Tonga boys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Suwarna had cut through Finscha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fen Huon Gulf to the protection of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bismarcks, and we were rolling over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand-mile stretch of open ocean with</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Hanover far behind us and our boat's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow pointed straight toward Nukuor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monte Verdes.

There was a spell of peace over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean that was semihypnotic, stilling even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Portuguese captain who stood dreamily</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the wheel, slowly swaying to the rhyth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mic lift and fall of the sloop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came a whining hail from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tonga boy lookout draped lazily over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sail he b'long port side!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Da Costa straightened and gazed while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I raised my glass. The vessel was a scant</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile away, and must have been visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">long before the sleepy watcher had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. She was a sloop about the size of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Suwarna, without power. All sails set,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even to a spinnaker she carried, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">making the best of the little breeze. I tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to read her name, but the vessel jibed</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply as though the hands of the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the wheel had suddenly dropped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">helm--and then with equal abruptness</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung back to her course. The stern came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sight, and on it I read Brunhilda.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shifted my glasses to the figure at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel. It came to me that there was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing odd about him. He was crouching</seg><seg type="columnLine">down over the spokes in a helpless, hud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dled sort of way, and even as I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vessel veered again, abruptly as be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore. I saw the helmsman straighten up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bring the wheel about with a vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood so for a moment, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight ahead, entirely oblivious of us,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and then seemed again to sink down within</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. It came to me that his was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">action of a man striving against a weari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness unutterable. I swept the deck with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my glasses. There was no other sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. I turned to find the Portuguese star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing intently and with puzzled air at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sloop, now separated from us by a scant</seg><seg type="columnLine">half mile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something veree wrong I think there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sair," he said in his curious English.

I saw the helmsman</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare about him and thought I heard him</seg><seg type="columnLine">curse. But we were now nearly abreast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scant five hundred yards away. The en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gine of the Suwarna died and the Tonga</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys leaped to one of the boats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You Olaf Huldricksson!" shouted Da</seg><seg type="columnLine">Costa.

The two Tonga boys had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat alongside and were waiting at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oars. The little captain was dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait!" I cried. I ran into my cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped my emergency medical kit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed down the rope ladder. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tonga boys bent to the oars. We reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side and Da Costa and I each seized a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lanyard dangling from the stays and swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves swiftly on board. Da Costa ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached Huldricksson softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter, Olaf?" he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then was silent, looking down at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel. My gaze followed his and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrank together involuntarily. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of Huldricksson were lashed fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the spokes of the wheel by thongs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin, strong cord. They had been bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">so tightly that they were swollen and black.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thongs had bitten so into the sinewy</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists that they were hidden in the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raged flesh, cutting so deeply that blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell, slow drop by drop, at his feet. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang toward him, reaching out hands to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fetters to loose them. Even as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched them, Huldricksson grew rigid</seg><seg type="columnLine">with anger that had in it something dia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolic. He aimed a vicious kick at me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then another at Da Costa which sent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portuguese tumbling into the scuppers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let be!" croaked Huldricksson; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice was as thick and lifeless as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced from a dead throat, and I saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips were cracked and dry and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">parched tongue was black. "Let be' Go!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let be!" The words beat upon the ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily, painfully. It was the dead alive</seg><seg type="columnLine">and speaking!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Portuguese had picked himself up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whimpering with rage and knife in hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as Huldricksson's voice reached him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped. Amazement crept into his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as he thrust the blade back into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt they softened with pity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something veree wrong wit' Olaf," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured to me. "I think he crazee!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And then Olaf Huldricksson began to curse</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. He did not speak--he howled from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideously dry mouth his imprecations and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think I never heard such hate and bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terness issue from any man's lips. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed us by everything in heaven and</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth and hell--yes, and he cursed earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hell and heaven as well. And all the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bloodshot eyes roamed the seas and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands, clenched and rigid on the wheel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I go below," said Da Costa nervously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"His wife, his little Freda, they are always</seg><seg type="columnLine">wit' him.

Huldricksson</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly was silent, slumping down over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wheel, forgetting us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Da Costa's head appeared at the top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the companion steps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is nobody, nobody," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I do not understan'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Olaf Huldricksson opened his dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips again and as he spoke a thrill ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">through me, stopping my heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The sparkling devil took them!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">croaked Olaf Huldricksson. "The sparkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil took them! Took my Helma and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Freda! The sparkling devil came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from the moon and took them! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He swayed and two great tears ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">down his cheeks. Da Costa moved toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">him again, and again Huldricksson watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, once more alertly, wickedly, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his reddened eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took a hypodermic syringe from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">case and filled it with morphin. I drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Da Costa to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get to the side of him," I whispered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"talk to him." He saw the little syringe</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my hand and nodded. He moved over</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the wheel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Where is your Helma and Freda,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Olaf?" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Huldricksson turned his head toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "The shining devil took them," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated. "The moon devil."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A yell broke from him. I had thrust the</seg><seg type="columnLine">needle into his arm just above one swollen</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist and had quickly shot the drug</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. He struggled to release himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then began to rock drunkenly side by</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. The morphin, taking him in his weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONQUEST OF THE MOON POOL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, worked quickly. Soon over his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw a peace descend. The pupils of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring eyes contracted. Once, twice, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed and then his bleeding, prisoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands held high and still gripping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel, he dropped to the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was with utmost difficulty that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosed the thongs, but at last it was done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We rigged a little swing and the Tonga</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys slung the great inert body over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side into the dory. Soon we had Huldricks-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son in my bunk. Da Costa sent half his</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew over to the sloop in charge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cantonese. They took in all sail, stripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huldricksson's boat to the masts and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Brunhilda nosing quietly along</seg><seg type="columnLine">after us at the end of a long hawser, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Tonga boys at her wheel, we re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed our way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had cleansed and bandaged the drug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ged Norseman's lacerated wrists and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponging the blackened, parched mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">with warm water and a mild antiseptic</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the Portuguese softly entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin. I did not hear him until he spoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so engrossed was I in my thoughts of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery of the Brunhilda. At first, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huldricksson had spoken of a "sparkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil from the moon" I had felt a shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">of apprehension. Could it be that on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very threshold of my quest the Dweller</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come out to meet me?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in the light of Huldricksson's fet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering this thought had vanished. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">had probably occurred on the Brunhilda</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of those swift, devilish tragedies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the South Seas that ever and anon flare</seg><seg type="columnLine">up like lightning out of hell. A mutiny of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only half tamed crew, a treacherous</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow from behind that had felled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norseman to the deck, a mordant humor</seg><seg type="columnLine">or obscure superstition that had left him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to awaken fettered to the wheel of his rav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished vessel, a carrying away of mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">and child to some unspeakable death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SUCH a story is a commonplace in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast reaches of sea and sea-hidden lairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cruel and savage tribes. And yet there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no mark or blow upon the captain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. Suddenly I was aware of Da Costa's</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence and turned. His unease was mani-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fest and held, it seemed to me, a queer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">furtive anxiety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What you think of Olaf, sair?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. I shrugged my shoulders. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">think he killed his woman and his babee?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He went on. "You think he crazee and</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed all?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nonsense, Da Costa," I answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You saw the boat was gone. His crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutinied and tied him up the way you</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Da Costa shook his head slowly. "No,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "No. The crew did not.

"What do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I mean," he said slowly, "that Olaf tie</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait!" he went on at my incredulous</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture of dissent. "Wait, I show you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had been standing with hands behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back and now I saw that he held in</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the same thongs that had bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huldricksson. They were bloodstained and</seg><seg type="columnLine">each ended in a broad leather tip skill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully spliced into the cord. "Look!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, pointing to these leather ends. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked and saw in them deep indentations</seg><seg type="columnLine">as of teeth. I snatched one of the thongs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and opened the mouth of the unconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">man on the bunk. Carefully I placed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather within it and gently forced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaws shut on it. It was true. Those marks</seg><seg type="columnLine">were where Olaf Huldricksson's teeth had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped! Dazed, I turned to Da Costa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait!" he said again. "I show you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took the cords and rested his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the supports of a chair back. Rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he twisted one of the thongs around his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand, drew a loose knot, shifted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord up toward his elbow. This left wrist</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hand still free and with them he</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted the other cord around the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist; drew a similar knot. His hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now in the exact position that Hul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dricksson's had been on the Brunhilda but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with cords and knots hanging loose. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Da Costa reached down his head, took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a leather end in his teeth and with a jerk</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew the end of the thong that noosed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his left hand tight; similarly he drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight the second.</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then he stood and strained at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fetters.

He nodded acquiescence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was silent for a time. "What did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think, sair, of what he said of sparkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">devils?" he asked at last. And as he spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew that this was what had been on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind all along. Clearly he knew some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, had heard something, that gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words I had dismissed an unquieting</seg><seg type="columnLine">significance. I looked at him closely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," I said. "Do you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fidgeted, avoided my eyes, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">surreptitiously crossed himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he replied. "I know nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some tilings I have heard, but they tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">many tales on these seas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned, almost abruptly, and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the door. Before he reached it he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned again. "But this I do know," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">half whispered, "I do know I am glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is no full moon tonight." He passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, leaving me staring after him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement. What did the Portuguese</seg><seg type="columnLine">know?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I bent over the sleeper. On his face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no trace of that unholy mingling of oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sites, of mingled joy and fear, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dweller stamped upon its victims. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Da Costa's revelations the security</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had felt in my theory of the prisoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists crumbled. Huldricksson's words</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back to me--"The sparkling devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">took them!" Nay, they had been even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more explicit--"The sparkling devil that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down from the moon!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They sank upon my heart like weights,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying subconscious conviction that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted all my efforts to dismiss. I lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheet from Huldricksson and went over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his body minutely, turning it from side to</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. The Norseman was, as I have said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a giant, and his mighty, muscled form was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean and white as a girl's. Nowhere was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there a trace of that cold, white stain which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the mark of the touch of the Dweller</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that had been, on Throckmartin, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining cincture girdling the body just be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low the heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throckmartin had believed, and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed with him, that the thing I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone forth to find had no power outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the islet of the moon door and that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only by virtue of that mark it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">enabled to follow him. But was this true?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huldricksson had been steering straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Ponape, not away from it--and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no trace of the Nan-Matal's dread</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had the Dweller swept down unheralded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unknown upon the Brunhilda, draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down the moon path Olaf Huldricks-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's wife and babe even as it had drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">Throckmartin? But if this were so then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must revise much of what I thought I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew of its action, for the ravishing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Brunhilda could mean only one of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">things: we had been wrong in our theory</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Dweller's power was limited by</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, or else in the years that had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">its power had overcome that limitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I sat thinking, the cabin grew sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly dark, and from above came a shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and patter of feet. Down upon us</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept one of the abrupt, violent squalls</seg><seg type="columnLine">that are met with in those latitudes. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashed Huldricksson fast in the berth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran up on deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A HALF hour passed.

Its occupant took a long puff</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his cigarette, waved a cheerful hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shouted a reassuring greeting. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as he did so a great wave raised itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">up behind him, took the wreckage, tossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it high in a swelter of foam, and passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. When we had steadied our boat, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck and man had been was--nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I scanned the water with anxious eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who had been this debonair castaway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from whence in these far seas had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped his plane? There came a tug at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side of our boat, two muscular brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands gripped it close to my left, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sleek, black, wet head showed its top</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them. Two bright blue eyes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">held deep within them a laughing dev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iltry looked into mine, and a long, lithe</seg><seg type="columnLine">body drew itself gently over the thwart</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seated its dripping self at my feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Much obliged," said this man from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea.

What did</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man know, I wondered, and what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the explanation of his remarks in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin and of his manifest unease?</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Keefe's sharp eyes had noted the glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, misinterpreting it and my consequent</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitation, flushed in embarrassment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, I beg your pardon," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Maybe I oughtn't to have asked that?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's no secret, lieutenant," I replied,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat testily.

I made</seg><seg type="columnLine">up my mind then to question him when</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity came. He turned from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick scrutiny of the sea and addressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Keefe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's nothing on board to fit you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieutenant," he said, looking over the tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure before him.

Darkness had fallen, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two disappeared I softly opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of my own cabin and listened. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear Huldricksson breathing deeply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I drew my electric flash, and shielding</seg><seg type="columnLine">its rays from my face, looked at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His sleeping was changing from the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupor of the drug into one that was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least on the borderland of the normal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Satisfied as to his condition, I returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">O'KEEFE was there on deck, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a specter in the cotton sheet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had wrapped about him. A deck table had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been cleated down and one of the Tonga</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys was setting it for our dinner. Soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very creditable larder of the Suwarna</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed the board, and O'Keefe, Da Costa</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I attacked it. The night had grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">close and oppressive. Behind us the for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward light of the Brunhilda glided and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">binnacle lamp threw up a faint glow in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which her black helmsman's face stood out</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistily. O'Keefe had looked curiously a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of times at our tow, but had asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">no questions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're not the only passenger we</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up today," I told him.

"We'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wait until he wakes up to get the story,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I concluded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wife and child gone!" said O'Keefe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And you saw nothing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From the condition of his mouth he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been alone at the wheel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">without water at least two days and nights</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we found him," I replied.

"But his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife and baby! Poor, poor devil!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I watched O'Keefe as he talked, feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">my liking for him steadily increasing. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could but have a man like this beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">me on the path of unknown peril upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had set my feet, I thought wist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. We sat and smoked a bit, sipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coffee the Portuguese made so well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Da Costa at last relieved the Cantonese</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the wheel. O'Keefe and I drew chairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the rail. The brighter stars shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">out dimly through a hazy sky. Gleams of</seg><seg type="columnLine">phosphorescence tipped the crests of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves and sparkled with an almost angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliance as the bow of the Suwarna</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed them aside. Far to the east a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver glow heralded the rising moon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Keefe pulled contentedly at a cigarette.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The glowing spark lighted the keen, boyish</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and the blue eyes, now black and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brooding under the spell of the tropic</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you American or Irish, O'Keefe?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I asked suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why?" he laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because," I answered, "from your</seg><seg type="columnLine">name and your service I would suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">you Irish, but your command of pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">Americanese makes me doubtful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grinned amiably.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll tell you how that is," he said. "My</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother is an American--a Grace, of Vir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginia. My father was O'Keefe, of Cole-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raine. And these two loved each other so</seg><seg type="columnLine">well that the heart they gave me is half</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irish and half American. My father died</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I was sixteen. I used to go to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">States with my mother every other year</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a month or two.

I gasped, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a jump for the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of the corner of my eye I noted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">look of half-sheepish relief flit over</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Keefe's face, and then he was beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Da Costa shouted'an order from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel, the Cantonese ran up and took it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his hands and the little Portuguese</seg><seg type="columnLine">pattered down toward us. My hand on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, ready to throw it open, I stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What if the Dweller were within? What if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new power I feared it had attained</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made it not only independent of place</seg><seg type="columnLine">but independent of that full flood of moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray which Throckmartin had thought es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sential to draw it from the blue pool!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Portuguese had paused, too, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at him I saw my own cravenness</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected.

O'Keefe</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed me aside and with one quick mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion threw open the door and crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">low within it. I saw an automatic flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">dully in his hand; saw it cover the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">from side to side, following the swift sweep</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONQUEST OF THE MOON POOL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of his eyes around it.

Through the window streamed a shaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the moonlight. It fell upon Huldricks-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's staring eyes; in them great tears</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly gathered and rolled down his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks; from his opened mouth came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woe-laden wailing. I ran to the port and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew the curtains. Da Costa snapped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Norseman's dolorous crying stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">as abruptly as though cut. His gaze rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward us. And then his whole body red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dened with a shock of rage, and at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound he broke through the strong leashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 had buckled round him and faced us, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant, naked figure tense with wrath, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes glaring, his yellow hair almost erect</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the force of the passion visibly surg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through him. Da Costa shrunk behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. O'Keefe, coolly watchful, took a quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">step that brought him in front of me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where do you take me?" said Hul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dricksson, and his voice was thick as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">growl of a beast. ''Where is my boat?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I touched O'Keefe gently and stood in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the giant. He glared at me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw the muscles of the gigantic arms flex</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the hands below the bandaged wrist</seg><seg type="columnLine">clench. He was berserk--mad!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, Olaf Huldricksson," I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We take you to where the sparkling devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">took your Helma and your Freda.

I spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, distinctly, striving to pierce the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mists that I knew swirled around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained brain. And the words did pierce.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stared at me for a moment. I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Keefe murmur: "Good stuff! That's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea. Humor him." Huldricksson stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and thrust out a shaking hand. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped it I saw his madness fade, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">his great chest heaved and fell. "You say</seg><seg type="columnLine">you follow?" he asked falteringly. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know where to follow? Where it took my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helma and my little Freda?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just that, Olaf Huldricksson," I an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered. "Just that! I pledge you my life</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Da Costa stepped forward. "He speaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">true, Olaf," he said. "Dr. Goodwin here</seg><seg type="columnLine">he follow as he say. You go faster on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suwarna than on the Br-rw-an'ilda, Olaf,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The giant Norseman, still gripping my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, looked at him. "I know you Da</seg><seg type="columnLine">Costa," he said. "You are all right. Ja!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You are a fair man.

He glanced from one to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. The giant shifted his own tense</seg><seg type="columnLine">look from me to the Irishman. I saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam of approval in his eyes. He loosed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and gripped O'Keefe's arm. "Staerkl"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "Ja--strong and with a strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. A man--ja! He comes, too--we</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall need him--ja?" He turned toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I looked toward O'Keefe and saw his</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt deepen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He comes," I said, "if he can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONCE more Huldricksson searched me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his glance; once more turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and absorbed O'Keefe in the icy blue of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man, ja," he repeated.

"It was four nights</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago. My Freda"--his voice shook--"Mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yndling! She loved the moonlight. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the wheel and my Freda and my Helma</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were behind me.

And then I heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream from my Helma, a great scream--</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a mare when her foal is torn from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.

I saw--" He covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes with his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Portuguese had crept close to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and 1 heard him panting like a frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog. O'Keefe, immobile, watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norseman narrowly. His hand fell and hate</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept into his eyes; a bitter hate; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">winged and white-hot hate that makes even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gods tremble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I saw a white fire spring over the rail,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered Olaf Huldricksson. "It whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">round and round, and it shone like--like</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars in a whirlwind mist. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise in my ears. It sounded like bells--</seg><seg type="columnLine">little bells, ja! Like the music you make</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you run your finger round goblets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It made me sick and dizzy, the bells' noise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My Helma was--indeholde--what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say--in the middle of the white fire. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned her face to me and she turned it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the child, and my Helma's face burned into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my heart. Because it was full of fear, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was full of happiness--of glyaede. I tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you that the fear in my Helma's face made</seg><seg type="columnLine">me ice here"--he beat his breast with</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched hand--"but the happiness in it</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned on me like fire. And I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I said in here"--he touched his head--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I said, 'It is Loki come out of Helvede.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he cannot take my Helma, for Christ</seg><seg type="columnLine">•lives and Loki has no power to hurt my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helma or my Frede! Christ lives! Christ</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives!' I said. But the sparkling devil did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not let my Helma go. It drew her to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail; half over it. I saw her eyes upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">child and a little she broke away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached to it. And my Freda jumped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arms. And the fire wrapped them both</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they w'ere gone! A little I saw them</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling on the moon track behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brunhilda, and they were gone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The sparkling devil took them!

My</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys crept up and asked me to turn again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I would not. They dropped a boat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left me.

Larry felt it and I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him look at me askance. If Olaf, sitting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bow, felt it, too, he gave no sign. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue eyes, with again the glint of ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">within them watched the channel before us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we passed, there arose upon our left</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer walls of black basalt blocks, cyclo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pean, towering fifty feet or more, broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there by the sinking of their deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">foundations. And only where they had so</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken, had the hand of time been able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to crumble them. From these dark ram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts the silence seemed to ooze, and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin crept as though from hidden places</seg><seg type="columnLine">in them scores of eyes, ages dead, peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">out at us, like ghosts of a lost Atlantis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In front of us the mangroves widened</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and filled the canal.

Through breaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">I caught glimpses of dark ruins and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">great fallen stones that seemed to crouch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and menace us as we passed. Somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, hidden, were the seven globes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured the moon fire down upon the Moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now we were among the mangroves and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sail down, the three of us pushed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled the boat through their tangled roots</seg><seg type="columnLine">and branches.

And now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">we were through, floating on a little open</seg><seg type="columnLine">space of shadow-filled water. Before us</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted the gateway of Nan-Tanach, gigan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic, broken, incredibly old. Shattered por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tals through which had passed men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">women of earth's dawn; old with a weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of years that pressed leadenly upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes that looked upon it, and yet in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious, indefinable way--menacingly de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond the gate, back from the portals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched a flight of enormous basalt slabs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a giant's stairway indeed; and from each</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of it marched the high walls that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the Dweller's pathway. None of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke as we grounded the boat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged it up upon a half-submerged pier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What next?" whispered Larry, at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think we ought to take a look</seg><seg type="columnLine">around," I replied in the same low tones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We'll climb the wall here and take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash about.

And opposite it</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be, if Throckmartin's story had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a dream, the gray slab he had named</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Wonder where the German fellow can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be?" asked Larry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shook my head.

The other gave a final</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">burst from its machine gun and fled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The globe did not pursue; there was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no need.

Its tip touched the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">airplane, and like its mate it vanished,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with that same greenish haze as the only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sign of its passing!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THE sun rose over a disorganized city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">People half-heartedly started toward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their work.

A flare of green struck a gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">squad and passed on.

The various</seg><seg type="columnLine">governments all solemnly stipulated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">abide by the decision of the congress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, after spending months in hard but</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruitless labor, that body was no nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of its undertaking than when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">first assembled. The entire world awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">its decision with bated breath, and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the decision was not formed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this paralyzing crisis a most unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected event suddenly opened the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THE MAGICIAN OF SCIENCE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AN ATTENDANT entered the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the perplexed financiers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in session and presented a peculiar-look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing card to the president, Mr. Boon. The »</seg><seg type="columnLine">president took the card in his hand and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete was his absorption that Herr</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finster, the celebrated Berlin banker, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been addressing the chair for the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hours from the opposite end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long table, got confused, entirely lost track</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his verb, and suddenly dropped into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat, very red in the face and wearing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">most injured expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But President Boon paid no attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">except to the singular card, which he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued to turn over and over, balancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it on his fingers and holding it now at</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm's-length and then near his nose, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one eye squinted as if he were trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look through a hole in the card.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At length this odd conduct of the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siding officer drew all eyes upon the card,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then everybody shared the interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mr. Boon. In shape and size the card</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOON METAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was not extraordinary, but it was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed ol metal. What metai? Plainly it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not tin, brass, copper, bronze, silver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aluminum--although its lightness might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have suggested that metal--nor even base</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The president, although a skilled metal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurgist, confessed his inability to say what</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was. So intent had he become in ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amining the curious bit of metal that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot it was a visitor's card of introduc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and did not even look for the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it presumably bore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he held the card up to get a better</seg><seg type="columnLine">light upon it, a stray sunbeam from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window fell across the metal, and instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">it bloomed with exquisite colors! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">president's chair being in the darker end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room, the radiant card suffused the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere about him with a faint rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">tint, playing with surprising liveliness into</seg><seg type="columnLine">alternate canary color and violet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The effect upon the company of clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed financiers was extremely remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. The unknown metal appeared to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ercise a kind of mesmeric influence, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft hues blending together in a chromatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmony which captivated the sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision as the ears are charmed by a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly rendered song. Gradually all gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered in an eager group around the presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent's chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What can it be?" was repeated from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Y\p to lip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you ever see anything like it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Mr. Boon for the twentieth time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> None of them had ever seen the like of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. A spell fell upon the assemblage. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">five minutes no one spoke, while Mr. Boon</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to chase the flickering sunbeam</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the wonderful card. Suddenly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence was broken by a voice which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a touch of awe in it:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It must be the metal!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The speaker was an English financier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">First Lord of the Treasury, Hon.

Immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody echoed his remark, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain being thus relieved, the spell</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped from them and several laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">loudly over their momentary aberration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PRESIDENT BOON recollected him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, and, coloring slightly, placed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">card Hat on the table, in order more clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the name. In plain red letters it</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood forth with such surprising distinct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness that Mr. Boon wondered why he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">so long overlooked it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        Dr. MAX SYX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell the gentleman to come in," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the president, and thereupon the attendant</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw open the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The owner of the mysterious card fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">every eye as he entered.

He wore black mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taches. covering only half the width of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lip and drawn into projecting needles on</seg><seg type="columnLine">each side, while a spiked black beard</seg><seg type="columnLine">adorned the middle of his chin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled as he stepped confidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, with a courtly bow, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very disconcerting smile, because it more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than half resembled a sneer. This uncom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon person did not wait to be addressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have come to solve your problem,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, facing President Boon, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung round on his pivoted chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The metal!" exclaimed everybody in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a breath, and with a unanimity and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement which would have astonished</seg><seg type="columnLine">them if they had been spectators instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of actors of the scene. The tall stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed and smiled again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just so," he said.

He seemed to await a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply, and President Boon asked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What guarantee can you give that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply would be adequate and continu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will conduct a committee of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">congress to my mine in the Rocky Moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains, where, in anticipation of the event,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	have accumulated enough refined ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">temisium to provide every civilized land</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an amount of coin equivalent to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is formerly held in gold.

The finan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciers all jumped to their feet with ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamations of surprise and admiration,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gathered around the tray, whose daz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zling contents lighted up the corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room where it had been placed as if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon were shining there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were elegantly formed vases,</seg><seg type="columnLine">adorned with artistic figures, embossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and incised, and glowing with delicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors which shimmered in tiny waves with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest motion of the tray.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">various nations published official bulletins</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which the general facts omitting, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, such incidents as the singular ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hibition seen by the visiting financiers on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall of Dr. Syx's office--were detailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gratify the universal desire for in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> President Boon not only submitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the specimens of ore-bearing rock which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had brought from the mine to care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful analysis, but also appealed to several</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the greatest living chemists and min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eralogists to aid him; but they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">all equally mystified. The green sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance contained in the ore, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">differing slightly from ordinary chrys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">olite, answered all the known tests of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mineral. It was remembered, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, that Dr. Syx had said that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be likely to mistake the substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">for chrysolite, and the result of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiments justified his prediction. Evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently the doctor had gone a stone's-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast beyond the chemistry of the day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, just as evidently, he did not mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reveal his discovery for the benefit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">science, nor for the benefit of any pockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">except his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Notwithstanding the failure of the chem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ists to extract anything from Dr. Syx's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ore, the public at large never doubted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secret would be discovered in good</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, and thousands of prospectors flocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Teton Mountains in search of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ore. And without much difficulty they</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it. Evidently the doctor had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaken in thinking that his mine might</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOON METAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be the only one. The new miners hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimens of the green-speckled rock to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemical laboratories for experimentation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and meanwhile began to lay up stores of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ore in anticipation of the time when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proper way to extract the metal should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be discovered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, alas! that time did not come. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh ore proved to be as refractory as that</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been obtained from Dr. Syx.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But in the midst of the universal disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointment there came a new sensation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE morning the newspapers glared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a despatch from Grand Teton</seg><seg type="columnLine">station announcing that the metal itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been discovered by prospectors on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastern slope of the main peak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It outcrops in many places," ran the</seg><seg type="columnLine">despatch, "and many small nuggets have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been picked out of crevices in the rocks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The excitement produced by this news</seg><seg type="columnLine">was even greater than when gold was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered at the South Pole. Again a mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush was made for the Tetons. The heights</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Jackson's Hole and the shores of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson's and Jenny's lakes were quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dotted with camps, and the military force</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to be doubled to keep off the curious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and occasionally menacing, crowds which</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered in the vicinity and seemed bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">on unearthing the great secret locked be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the windowless walls of the mill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There, the column of black smoke and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of the engine served as reminders of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the incredible wealth which the sole pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessor of that secret was rolling up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time no mistake had been made.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a fact that the metal, in virgin</seg><seg type="columnLine">purity, had been discovered scattered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">various places on the ledges of the Grand</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teton. In a little while thousands had</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained specimens with their own hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The quantity was distressingly small, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidering the number and the eagerness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seekers, but that it was genuine arte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">misium not even Dr. Syx could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">denied. He, however, made no attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">deny it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he said when questioned, "I find</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I have been deceived. At first I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thought the metal existed only in the form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the green ore, but of late I have come</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon veins of pure artemisium in my mine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am glad for your sakes, but sorry for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own. Still, it may turn out that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no great amount of free artemisium,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the doctor talked in this manner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">close observers detected a lurking sneer</seg><seg type="columnLine">which his acquaintances had not noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">since artemisium was first adopted as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money basis of the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd that swarmed upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain quickly exhausted all of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible supply of the metal. Sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">they found it in a thin stratum at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of crevices, where it could be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached in opalescent plates and leaves of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thickness of paper. These superficial</seg><seg type="columnLine">deposits evidently might have been formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from water holding the metal in solution.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Occasionally, deep cracks contained nug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets and wiry masses which looked as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had run together when they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">molten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The most promising spots were soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">staked out in miners' claims, machinery</seg><seg type="columnLine">was procured, • stock companies were</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed, and borings were begun. The en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thusiasm arising from the earlier finds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the flattering surface indications</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused everybody to work with feverish</seg><seg type="columnLine">haste and energy, and within two months</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundred tunnels were piercing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time nobody was willing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit the truth which gradually forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself upon the attention of the miners.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The deeper they went the scarcer became</seg><seg type="columnLine">the indications of artemisium! In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such deposits as were found were confined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fissures near the surface. But Dr. Syx</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to report a surprising increase</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the amount of free metal in his mine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this encouraged all who had not ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted their capital to push on their tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nels in the hope of finally striking a vein.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At length, however, the smaller operators</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave up in despair, until only one heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">capitalized company still remained work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">52</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A STRANGE DISCOVERY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"TT IS my belief that Dr. Max Syx is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A a deceiver."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The person who uttered this opinion</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a young engineer, Andrew Hall, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had charge of the operations of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mining companies which were driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnels into the Grand Teton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean by that?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">President Boon, who was the principal</seg><seg type="columnLine">backer of the enterprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I mean," replied Hall, "that there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">no free metal in this mountain, and Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syx knows there is none."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But he is getting it himself from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine," retorted President Boon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So he says, but who has seen it?

He had made hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred turns of the handle when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drill shot through the rock! A gratified</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile illuminated his features, and he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a suppressed voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't be alarmed; I'm going to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the light."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly we were in complete dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, but being close at Hall's side I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">detect his movements.

But soon my vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared a little, and then I perceived that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was gazing into a narrow tunnel which</seg><seg type="columnLine">met ours directly end to end. Glancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the axis of this gallery, I saw, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred yards away, a faint light</seg><seg type="columnLine">which evidently indicated the mouth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">At the end where we had met it the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious tunnel was considerably</seg><seg type="columnLine">widened at one side, as if the excavators</seg><seg type="columnLine">had started to change direction and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned the work, and in this elbow</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could just see the outlines of two or</seg><seg type="columnLine">three flat cars loaded with broken stone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while a heap of the same material lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">near them. Through the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel ran a railway track.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T^O YOU know what you are looking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> -L'at?" asked Hall in my ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I begin to suspect," I replied, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have accidentally run into Dr. Syx's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"If Dr. Syx had been on his guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">this accident wouldn't have happened,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied Hall, with a low chuckle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I heard you remark a month ago," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "that you were changing the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of your tunnel.

But President Boon has great</seg><seg type="columnLine">faith in Dr. Syx. and would not give up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">general public, knowing nothing of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hall had discovered, and still believing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syx's story that he also had found pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">artemisium in his mine, accounted for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">failure of the tunneling operations on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposition that the metal, in a free state,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was excessively rare, and that Dr. Syx had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the luck to strike the only vein of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Grand Teton contained.

In the United States,</seg><seg type="columnLine">meetings of agitators passed furious reso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutions. denouncing the government, assail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the rich, cursing Dr. Syx, and calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon "the oppressed" to rise and "take</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own." The final outcome was, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, violence. Mobs had to be sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed by military force.

But the masonry was stronger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than they had anticipated, and the attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed.

In fact, the eastern side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grand Teton appears to be absolutely un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbable.

The air was deliciously clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sky wonderfully blue above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains, and the moon, a few days past</seg><seg type="columnLine">its last quarter, was visible in the south-</seg><seg type="columnLine">west, its pale crescent face slightly blued</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the atmosphere, as it always appears</seg><seg type="columnLine">when seen in daylight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Slow westering, a phantom sail--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    The lonely soul of yesterday.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BEHIND us, somewhat north of east,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay the Syx works, with their black</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke rising almost vertically in the still</seg><seg type="columnLine">air.

As soon as we saw that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grapple was well over the edge we pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the rope.

And how could we know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second hold would prove more secure</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the first? Hall did not hesitate, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, for one instant. Up he went again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiut, in fact, his best chance was in going</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, for he was within four yards of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top when the mishap occurred. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">62</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sigh of relief I saw him at last throw his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">arm over the verge and then wriggle his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">body upon the ledge. A few seconds later</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he was lying on his stomach, with his face</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over the edge, looking down at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Come on!" he shouted. "It's all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">WHEN I had pulled myself over the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brink at his side I grasped his hand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and pressed it without a word. We under-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stood each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It was pretty close to a miracle," he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">remarked at last. "Look at this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The rock over which the grapple had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slipped was deeply scored by the unyield-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing point of the metal, and exactly at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">verge of the precipice the prong had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wedged itself into a narrow crack so firmly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that we had to chip away the stone in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">order to release it. If it had slipped a single</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inch farther before taking hold it would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have been all over with my friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Such experiences shake the strongest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nerves, and we sat on the shelf we had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attained for fully a quarter of an hour</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">before we ventured to attack the next</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">precipice, which hung beetling directly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">above us. It was not as lofty as the one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we had just ascended, but it impended</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to such a degree that we saw we should</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have to climb our rope while it swung</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">free in the air!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Luckily we had little difficulty in get-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ting a grip for the prongs, and we took</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">every precaution to test the security of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the anchorage, not only putting our com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">t bined weight repeatedly upon the rope,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but flipping and jerking it with all our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strength. The grapple resisted every effort</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to dislodge it, and finally I started up,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">insisting on my turn as leader.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The height I had to ascend did not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">exceed one hundred feet, but that is a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very great distance to climb on a swing-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing rope, without a wall within reach to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">assist by its friction and occasional</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">friendly projections. In a little while my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">movements, together with the effect of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the slight wind, had imparted a most</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">distressing oscillation to the rope. This</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sometimes carried me with a nerve-shak-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing bang against a prominent point of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the precipice, where I would dislodge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">loose fragments that kept Hall dodging</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for his life, and then I would swing out,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">apparently beyond the brow of the cliff</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">below, so that, as I involuntarily glanced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">downward, I seemed to be hanging in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">free space, while the steep mountainside,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">looking ten times steeper than it really</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was, resembled the vertical wall of an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">absolutely bottomless abyss, as if I were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suspended over the edge of the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I avoided thinking of what the grapple</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be about, and in my haste to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">through with the awful experience I</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked myself fairly out of breath, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that when at last I reached the rounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">brow of the cliff I had to stop and cling</seg><seg type="columnLine">there for fully a minute before I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">summon strength enough to lift myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">over it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I was assured that the grapple</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still securely fastened I signalled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hall, and he soon stood at my side, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claiming as he wiped the perspiration from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think I'll try wings next time!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But our difficulties had only begun. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had foreseen, it was a case of Alp above</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alp, to the very limit of human strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">and patience. However, it would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been impossible to go back. In order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">descend the two precipices we had sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted it would have been necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave our lifelines clinging to the rocks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we had not rope enough to do that. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could not reach the top we were lost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAVING refreshed ourselves with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bite to eat and a little stimulant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we resumed the climb. After several hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the most exhausting work I have ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">performed we pulled our weary limbs upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the narrow ridge, but a few square yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">in area, which constitutes the apex of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grand Teton. A little below, on the oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">site side of a steep-walled gap which di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vides the top of the mountain into two</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts, we saw the singular inclosure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones which the early white explorers</seg><seg type="columnLine">found there, and which they ascribed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOON METAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">63</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Indians, although nobody has ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">known who built it or what purpose it</seg><seg type="columnLine">served.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The view was, of course, superb, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I was admiring it in all its wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful extent and variety, Hall, who had im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately pulled out his binocular, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy inspecting the Syx works, the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of whose great tufted smoke column was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of feet beneath our level.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There!" suddenly exclaimed Hall, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought 1 should find it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take a look through my glass at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof of Syx's mill.

Pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently his mind seemed to return to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old magnet, and he whirled about and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced down at the Syx mill. The column</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smoke was diminishing in volume, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">indication that the engine was about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoy one of its periodical rests. The ir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">regularity of these stoppages had always</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a subject of remark among practical</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineers. The hours of labor were ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceedingly erratic, but the engine had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been known to work at night, except on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one occasion, and then only for a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, when it was suddenly stopped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">account of a fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just as Hall resumed his inspection,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two huge quarter spheres, which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting wide apart on the roof, moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward one another until their arched sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions met over the circular aperture which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they covered like the dome of an ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servatory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I expected it," Hall remarked.

As we passed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syx mine the doctor himself confronted</seg><seg type="columnLine">us.

Hall, observing my look, smiled sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificantly, but said nothing. The labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory proper occupied a smaller building</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjoining the domed structure.

In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther end of the tube gleamed a lump</seg><seg type="columnLine">of yellow metal, which I took to be gold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hall and I were seated near another table</seg><seg type="columnLine">about twenty-five feet distant from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube, and on this table was an apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnished with a concave mirror, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">optical axis was directed toward the tube.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It occurred to me at once that this appa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratus would be suitable for experimenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">with electric waves. Wires ran from- it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor, and in the cellar beneath was</seg><seg type="columnLine">audible the beating of an engine.

"Look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearer end of the tube!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, it is becoming coated with gold!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled, but made no reply. Still the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange process continued. The pink vapor</seg><seg type="columnLine">became so dense that the lump of gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no longer visible, although the eye of</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet light glared piercingly through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored fog. Every second the deposit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal, shining like a mirror, increased, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til suddenly there came a curious whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tling sound. Hall, who had been adjusting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mirror, jerked away his hand and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">it a flip, as if hot water had spattered it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then the light in the tube quickly died</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, the vapor escaped, filling the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a peculiar stimulating odor, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceived that the end of the glass tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been melted through, and the molten</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold was slowly dripping from it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I carried it a little too far," said Hall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruefully rubbing the back of his hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and w'hen the glass gave way under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atomic bombardment a few atoms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold visited my bones.

"You no doubt have been told</seg><seg type="columnLine">how one night the Syx engine was heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">working for a few minutes, the first and</seg><seg type="columnLine">only night work it was ever known to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done, and how, hardly had it started</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, when a fire broke out in the mill, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engine was instantly stopped. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is a very remarkable story connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that, and it will show you how I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">my first clue to the mystery, although it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rather a mere suspicion than a clue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for at first I could make nothing out of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The alleged fire occurred about a fort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night after our discovery of the double</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel. My mind was then full of suspi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cions concerning Syx, because I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a man who would fool people with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand was not likely to deal fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was a glorious night, with a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, whose face was so clear in the limpid</seg><seg type="columnLine">air that, having found a snug place at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot of a yellow-pine tree, where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground was carpeted with odoriferous</seg><seg type="columnLine">needles, I lay on my back and renewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">my early acquaintance with the roman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically named mountains and 'seas' of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lunar globe. With my binocular I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace those long white streaks which radi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate from the crater ring, called 'Tycho/</seg><seg type="columnLine">and run hundreds of miles in all directions</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the moon. As I gazed at tfiese singu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar objects I recalled the various theories</seg><seg type="columnLine">which astronomers, puzzled bv their enig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matical aspect, have offered to a more or</seg><seg type="columnLine">less confiding public concerning them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the midst of my meditation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon-gazing I was startled by hearing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine in the Syx works suddenly begin</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to run. Immediately a queer light, shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the beam of a ship's searchlight, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">reddish in color, rose high in the moonlit</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens above the mill. It did not last</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a minute or two, for almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly the engine was stopped, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its stoppage the light faded and disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared. The next day Dr. Syx gave it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that on starting up his engine in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night something had caught fire, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">compelled him immediately to shut down</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. The few who had seen the light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the exception of your humble serv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant, accepted the doctor's explanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a question. But I knew there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been no fire, and Syx's anxiety to spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lie led me to believe that he had nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowly escaped giving away a vital secret.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said nothing about my suspicions, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon inquiry I found out that an extra</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pressing order for metal had arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the government the very day of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretended fire, and I drew the inference</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Syx, in his haste to fill the order--</seg><seg type="columnLine">his supply having been drawn low--had</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to work, contrary to his custom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at night, and had immediately found rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son to repent his rashness.

But--and this was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">supreme importance--1 found that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of projection was directly toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus from which the impulse pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducing the charge had come. In other</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, I could produce two poles between</seg><seg type="columnLine">which a marvelous interaction occurred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My transformer, with its concentrating</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror, acted, as one pole, from which en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ergy was transferred to the other pole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that other pole immediately flung off</seg><seg type="columnLine">atoms of its own substance in the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the transformer. But these atoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stopped by the glass wall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacuum tube; and when I tried the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periment with the metal removed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacuum, and surrounded with air, it failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This at first completely discouraged ,</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, until I suddenly remembered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon is in a vacuum, the great vacuum</seg><seg type="columnLine">of interplanetary space, and that it pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sesses no perceptible atmosphere of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">own. At this a great light broke around</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and I shouted 'Eureka!' Without hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation I constructed a transformer of great</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, furnished with a large parabolic</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror to transmit the waves in parallel</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines, erected the machinery and buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, and when all was ready for the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment I telegraphed for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Prepared by these explanations, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all on fire to see the thing tried. Hall was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no less eager, and, calling in his two</seg><seg type="columnLine">faithful assistants to make the final ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">justments, he led the way into what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">facetiously named "the lunar chamber."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we fail," he remarked with a smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had an element of worriment in it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"it will become the 'lunatic chamber'--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but no danger of that. You observe this</seg><seg type="columnLine">polished silver knob, supported by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic rod curved over at the top like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crane. That constitutes the pole from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I propose to transmit the energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the moon, and upon which I expect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm of atoms to be centered by reflec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion from the mirror at whose focus it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One moment," I said. "Am I to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand that you think that the moon is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid mass of artemisium, and that no mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter where your radiant force strikes it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">'kathodic pole' will be formed there from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which atoms will be projected to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Hall; "I must carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">choose the point on the lunar surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">where to operate. But that will present</seg><seg type="columnLine">no difficulty. 1 made up my mind as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I had penetrated Syx's secret that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained the metal from those mystic</seg><seg type="columnLine">white streaks which radiate from Tycho,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and which have puzzled the astronomers</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever since the invention of telescopes. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">now believe those streaks to be composed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of immense veins of the metal that Syx</seg><seg type="columnLine">has most appropriately named artemis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ium, which you, of course, recognize as</seg><seg type="columnLine">being derived from the name of the Greek</seg><seg type="columnLine">goddess of the moon, Artemis, whom the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Romans called Diana. But now to work!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS less than a day past the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">of new moon, and the earth's satellite</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too near the sun to be visible in broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">daylight. Accordingly, the mirror had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be directed by means of knowledge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon's place in the sky. Driven by ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curate clockwork, it could be depended</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon to retain the proper direction when</seg><seg type="columnLine">once set.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With breathless interest I watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceedings of my friend and his assist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants. When everything had been adjusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his satisfaction, Hall stepped back, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">without betraying his excitement in flushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks and flashing eyes, and pressed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lever. The powerful engine underneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor instantly responded. The experiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">was begun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have set it upon a point about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred miles north of Tycho, where the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Yerkes photographs show a great abund-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of the white substance," said Hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then we waited. A minute elapsed. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird, fluttering in the opening above for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second or two, wrenched our strained</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves. Hall's face turned pale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They had better keep away from here,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he whispered with a ghastly smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two minutes! I could hear the beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my heart. The engine shook the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three minutes! Hall's face was wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with perspiration. The bird blundered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and startled us again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four minutes! We were like statues,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all eyes fixed on the polished ball of</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver, which shone in the brilliant light</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrated upon it by the mirror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Five minutes! The shining ball had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come a confused blue, and I violently</seg><seg type="columnLine">winked to clear my vision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At last! Thank Heaven! There it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Hall who spoke, trembling like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an aspen. The silver knob had changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">color. What seemed a miniature rainbow</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded it, with concentric circles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinding brilliance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then something dropped flashing into</seg><seg type="columnLine">an earthen dish set beneath the ball! An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other glittering drop followed, and, at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorter interval, another!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost before a word could be uttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drops had coalesced and became a tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, which, as it fell, twisted itself into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bright spiral, gleaming writh a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifting hues, and forming on the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dish a glowing, interlacing maze</seg><seg type="columnLine">of viscid rings and circlets, which turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and twined about and over one another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they had blended and settled into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a button-shaped mass of hot metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">jelly. Hall snatched the dish away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed another in its stead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This will be about right for a watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">charm when it cools," he said, with a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn of his customary self-command. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised you the first specimen. I'll catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">another for myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But can it be possible that we are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreaming?" I exclaimed.

"Haven't I just showed you the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole process?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I congratulate you. You will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">as rich as Dr. Syx."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps," was the unperturbed reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SIX weeks later the financial centers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth were shaken by the news</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a new supply of artemisium was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing marketed from a mill which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretly opened in the Sierras of California.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a time there was almost a panic. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hall had chosen to do so, he might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">precipitated serious trouble. But he im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately entered into negotiations with</seg><seg type="columnLine">government representatives, and the inev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itable result was that, to preserve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monetary system of the world from up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaval, Dr. Syx had to consent that Hall's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mill should share equally with his in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">production of artemisium. During the ne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotiations the doctor paid a visit to Hall's</seg><seg type="columnLine">establishment. The meeting between them</seg><seg type="columnLine">was most dramatic. Syx tried to blast his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rival with a glance, but knowledge is</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, and my friend faced his mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">antagonist, whose deepest secrets he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrated, with an unflinching eye. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was remarked that Dr. Syx became a</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed man from that moment. His mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terful air seemed to have deserted him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was with something resembling hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mility that he assented to the arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment which required him to share his</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous gains with his conqueror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course Hall's success led to an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediate recrudescence of the efforts to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tract artemisium from the Syx ore, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally of course, every such attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed. Hall, while keeping his own secret,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did all he could to discourage the experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, but they naturally believed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must have made the very discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was the subject of their dreams, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not, without betraying himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and upsetting the finances of the planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly undeceive them. The consequence</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that fortunes were wasted in hope-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less experimentation, and, with Hall's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">achievement dazzling their eyes, the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luded fortune-seekers kept on in the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of endless disappointments and disaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND presently there came another</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragedy. The Syx mill was blown up!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The accident--although many people re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused to regard it as an accident, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">asserted that the doctor himself in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chagrin had applied the match--the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosion, then, occurred about sundown, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its effects were awful. The great works,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with everything pertaining to them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every rail that they contained, were blown</seg><seg type="columnLine">to atoms. They disappeared as if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never existed. Even the twin tunnels</seg><seg type="columnLine">were involved in the ruin, a vast cavity</seg><seg type="columnLine">being left in the mountainside where Syx's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten acres had been. The force of the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosion was so great that the shattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock was reduced to dust. To this fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">was attributed the escape of the troops.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While the mountain was shaken to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">core, and enormous parapets of living</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock were hurled down the precipices of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Teton, no missiles of appreciable size</seg><seg type="columnLine">traversed the air, and not a man at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp was injured. But Jackson's Hole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with red dust, looked for days after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward like the mouth of a tremendous vol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cano just after an eruption. Dr. Syx had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been seen entering the mill a few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the catastrophe by a sentinel who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was stationed about a quarter of a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, and who, although he was felled</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an ox by the shock, and had his eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears, and nostrils filled with flying dust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">miraculously escaped with his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After this a new arrangement was made</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereby Andrew Hall became the sole</seg><seg type="columnLine">producer of artemisium, and his wealth</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to mount toward the starry heights</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the billions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About a year after the explosion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syx mill a strange rumor got about. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">came first from Budapest, in Hungary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it was averred several persons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">credibility had seen Dr. Max Syx. Mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions had been familiar with his face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his personal peculiarites, through actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting him, as well as through photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">72</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">graphs and descriptions, and, unless there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an intention to deceive, it did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem possible that a mistake could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made in identification. There surely never</seg><seg type="columnLine">was another man who looked just like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Syx. And yet, was it not demonstrable</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he must have perished in the awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction of his mill?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon after came a report that Dr. Syx</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been seen again, this time at Ekater-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inburg, in the Urals. Next he was said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have paid a visit to Batang, in the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainous district of southwestern China;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finally, according to rumor, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen in Sicily, at Nicolosi, among the vol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">canic pimples on the southern slope of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mount Etna.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next followed something of more cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious and even startling interest. A chem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ist at Budapest, where the first rumors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Syx's reappearance had placed the mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious doctor, announced that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce artemisium, and proved it, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he kept his process secret. Hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the sensation caused by this news</seg><seg type="columnLine">partially subsided when a similar report</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived from Ekaterinburg; then another</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Batang; after that a fourth from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nicolosi!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nobody could fail to notice the co-</seg><seg type="columnLine">incidence; wherever the doctor--or was</seg><seg type="columnLine">it his ghost?--appeared, there shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward somebody discovered the much-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought secret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After this Syx's apparitions rapidly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased in frequency, followed in each</seg><seg type="columnLine">instance by the announcement of an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other productive artemisium mill. He ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared in Germany, Italy, France, Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, and finally at many places in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is the old doctor's revenge," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hall to me one day, trying to smile, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the matter was too serious to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken humorously. "Yes, it is his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venge, and I must admit that it is com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete. The price of artemisium has fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-half within six months. All the efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have made to hold back the flood have</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved useless. The secret itself is be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming public property. We shall inev-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">itably be overwhelmed with artemisium.</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as we were with gold, and the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition of the financial world will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse than the first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My friend's gloomy prognostications</seg><seg type="columnLine">came near being fulfilled to the letter. Ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand artemisium mills shot their</seg><seg type="columnLine">etheric rays upon the moon, and our un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunate satellite's metal ribs were strip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped by atomic force. Some of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">white rays that had been one of the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scopic wonders of the lunar landscapes dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, and the face of the moon, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had remained unchanged before the eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the children of Adam from the begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning of their race, now looked as if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast of a furnace had sw^ept it. At night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the moonw'ard side, the earth was stud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ded with brilliant spikes all pointing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart of its child in the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the looting of the moon brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">disaster to the robber planet. So mad were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the efforts to get the precious metal that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface of our globe was fairly show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered with it, productive fields were, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some cases, almost smothered under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic coating, the air was filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining dust, until finally famine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pestilence joined hands with financial dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aster to punish the grasping world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then at last the various governments</seg><seg type="columnLine">took effective measures to protect them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves and their people. Another combined</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort resulted in an international agree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment whereby the production of the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious moon metal was once more rigidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAST OF DR. SYX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MANY years after the events last re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">corded, I sat, at the close of a bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant autumn day, side by side with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">old friend Andrew Hall on a broad, vine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaded piazza which faced the east, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the full moon was just rising above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rim of the Sierra, and replacing the rosy</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter-glow of sunset with its silvery</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiance. The sight was calculated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry the minds of both back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOON METAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">events of former years. But I noticed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hall quickly changed the position of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, and sat down again with his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the rising moon. He had managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save some millions from the wreck of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast fortune when artemisium started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to the dogs, and I was now paying</seg><seg type="columnLine">him one of my annual visits at his pala-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tial home in California.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did I ever tell you of my last trip to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Teton?" he asked, as I continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze contemplatively at the broad lunar</seg><seg type="columnLine">disk which slowly detached itself from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horizon and began to swim in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear evening sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"No," I replied; "but I'd like to hear."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Or of my last sight of Dr. Syx?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Indeed!

Finally I decided to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. I can tell you it was a gloomy place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">barren and deserted. The railroad had</seg><seg type="columnLine">long ago been abandoned, and the site of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the military camp could scarcely be recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized. An immense cavity showed where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Syx's mill used to send up its plume</seg><seg type="columnLine">of black smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As I stared at the gaunt form of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teton, whose beetling precipices had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed and split by the great explosion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was seized with a resistless impulse to</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb it.

I don't know why, but I drew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">away with much the same feeling as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fat chicker. might have, and was not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little angr&gt;.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is," I answered, reddening.

Not at all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Please don't be offended. I meant no harm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was just wondering how it seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">young.

"To be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure. Well, let me see. How would twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars and your board and room, sound?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sounds all right," I replied; "de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pending, though, a great deal on how I</seg><seg type="columnLine">earn it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man's eyes twinkled and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled. "You will earn it, sii, by doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. Absolutely nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rather easy," I answered. "But there</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be something for me to do.

To be sure! Well, we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">amend that.

He was a char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acter beyond doubt, and his personality</seg><seg type="columnLine">attracted me. I foresaw that I would en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy myself in his company. Here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone to observe, someone to study; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps a little risk. He was a man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some power, unknown perhaps, and might</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear watching. That, however, was an at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traction, rather than an obstacle. I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have had it just so. Therefore, we quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to an understanding and I agreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ALMOST IMMORTAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CASE-OF ALLEN DOREEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MY POSITION turned out to be an</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellent one. There was practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">no work, merely to listen to the old gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tleman, a task which I found not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting but agreeable. In the morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually between seven and eight, we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast, after which we read and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussed the newspapers. About ten we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">go for a short walk and make a few pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chases until noon, when we had lunch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From that time until three my time</seg><seg type="columnLine">was my own, while the doctor retired to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his laboratory, or sanctum, into which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was never invited, and none was allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go. This was something easily accounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">for. I figured that anyone who would will-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly devote his life to disease, drugs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemicals had all the license in the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be queer and particular in his habits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and let it go at that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About three the doctor reappeared, tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nervous, and ready for a game of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards. Always at this time of day I no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticed a hungry, longing look in his eyes;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but this I took to be merely the effect of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some strain on his mind, some scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact sought for but not attained and in no</seg><seg type="columnLine">way connected it with myself. From three</seg><seg type="columnLine">until dark it was the same thing day after</seg><seg type="columnLine">day; cards, conversation, and reading.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rather a snap, don't you think?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the days went by one after an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. Each week my check was in hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and each w'eek my savings mounted higher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day during a walk the doctor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ran across Hendricks. Of course, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to introduce them. The doctor seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased to meet him and he to meet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I noticed when they shook hands that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they gazed squarely into each other's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and laughed; they seemed to see clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">through each other and to take pleasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the accomplishment. Just before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">separated Hendricks took me by the arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rob," he said, "can you come down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the office? I must see you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Certainly," I answered. "This after-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">noon if you like. What's it about, Hen?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The doctor had been studying a window</seg><seg type="columnLine">display; but just then he happened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn and once again he and Hendricks</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed full into each other's eyes, and once</seg><seg type="columnLine">again they laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well!" snapped Hendricks. "Here's</seg><seg type="columnLine">my car. I must be going. Glad to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">met you, doctor. So long Rob."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And a moment later from the platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the car he shouted back through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands: "Important!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We stood for some moments on the curb</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the car jolting down the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the fog settling in, we were left</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone in the blanket of mist, gloomy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent. Somehow I felt like the weather,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold and monotonous and dreary; my life</seg><seg type="columnLine">was without sunshine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That man," said the doctor at length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"is dangerous."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What man!" I snapped, turning sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly on him. He started and eyed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, that man, of course, the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">we just left. Hendricks, of course. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">other could I mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I liked the old man immensely;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I could and would not stand there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see him abuse my friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here, doctor, you may be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned man all right and all that, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may know a good many things unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the rest of us poor mortals; but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't help you one whit, when it comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to judging men. I have known Hendricks</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically all my life and I know him</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost as well as myself. He is honest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearless and the best friend that ever trod</seg><seg type="columnLine">on tw'o feet. I will not hear a word against</seg><seg type="columnLine">him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My companion smiled good naturedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Whom are you working for, Mr. Rob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inson?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whose money are you drawing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, then, I want you to have nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do with Hendricks. He's too analytical,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too dangerous. I want you to leave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone."</seg><seg type="columnLine">88</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was going to answer him with heat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but just then our eyes met and I subsided.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the life of me, I could not tell why;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a complete change came over me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinctively felt that the doctor was right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was wrong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lunch was ready when we reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, and after the meal the doctor as</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual disappeared in his sanctum. Left to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own resources, I began to come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pish!" I exclaimed. "I'll go see Hen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dricks!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the hall I met the housekeeper. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dusting some furniture. I had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed my hand on the door knob when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she touched me gently on the shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Robinson.'"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I noticed that her voice was low and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautious with a sort of appeal in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She lifted her kind old face to mine;</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes full of tenderness and entreaty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I thought of pity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you think you had better go</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and stay? It's getting to be that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time of the year. You don't know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are doing or where you are going. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been watching the doctor. I am sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time is at hand. You are young; you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are handsome, full of life, and strength.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oh! It is not fit to be so! Do say that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will go!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She seized the lapels of my coat in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and looked up into my face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do say it!" she repeated. "He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill me if he knew I had warned you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then a door creaked or a window</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lowered. I know not what exactly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The woman drew back, her whole form</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigid with fear. We both listened. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment we stood like two silent statues,</seg><seg type="columnLine">alert, but hearing nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pshaw!" I said at length. "It is noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Now, mother, what is the trouble?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound of my voice restored her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little color came to her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go!" she said. "And be sure to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member what I have told you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that a door opened and she dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared. As for myself, I put on my hat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and started for town. A half hour later I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in Hendricks' office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ELL, Rob," he said, lighting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar, "you got here. Do you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would have wagered a good five-dollar</seg><seg type="columnLine">bill against a single unroasted peanut</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you would never have made it! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm mighty glad you are stronger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought. I suppose you know what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are up against!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now this was a line of talk for which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	was scarcely prepared, especially from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hendricks. Of course, I was some worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up after the little scene with the house-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper; but I hardly expected to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend in the same humor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, say," I cut in, "are you and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old lady in cahoots? Do you want me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lose a good thing? What's the mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought a while, went to the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watched the traffic in the street. Pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently he turned about and in his slow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnest way began to talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here, Rob. The gentleman to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom I was introduced today has in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested me more than any person I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever met.

I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">say it pleases me, though I am sorry to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find you in his company. I intend to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">you fair warning. I shall tell you what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is, and you can direct your future</seg><seg type="columnLine">actions accordingly. But first I want you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell me all you know about him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what has transpired since you have taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">up your position. Go ahead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kind of a poser, wasn't it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I had confidence in Hendricks. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the persons I had ever met, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last to take a dramatic posture. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew him for a deep water man, a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of deep thoughts and few words; but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words did come they were like chips of</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel, sharp and to the point. Therefore, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened my heart fully. I related to Hen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dricks all that I knew, also I told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the old lady's actions and the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hallway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ALMOST IMMORTAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN I had finished he smiled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began drubbing the desk with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what do you make of it?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I threw up my hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've got me, Hendricks.

You</seg><seg type="columnLine">may think I was perturbed; but I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not at all; I was merely doing what my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend had advised--playing safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If I were going to see the thing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the end, I calculated that perhaps a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little help at the climax would be a thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">most convenient.

When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he smiled the very atmosphere seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripple, his clear eyes fairly danced with</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirth and you felt a sort of infinite joy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mere privilege of sharing their pleasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had known him for many days--this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and during all that time I had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">him nothing but kindness and considera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, a companion, jolly at all times. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">I studied him and watched him, my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolted at its own folly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What a climax of things ridiculous to</seg><seg type="columnLine">classify this man with a species of moral</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">outcast, which mankind in its loathsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror has refused a classification with</seg><seg type="columnLine">either man or beast. Can you blame me for</seg><seg type="columnLine">laying the paper back on the table? I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">only folded it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE game continued, the doctor win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning regularly and deriving an infinite</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy therefrom; and I, with all I had on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind, watching him intently for ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">so small a sign that might signify or prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to be anything but that to which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clock struck nine.

I had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, and, having none, I tried to laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">at myself for giving way to nerves. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of all my efforts, I felt myself slip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping, a great lump came in my throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I could not down, and I could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">my heart thumping against my ribs, pulsat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing so loudly that I was rather surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the doctor did not notice it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fifteen minutes to ten. I was watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">keenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At your first move, old man, I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangle you," I said to myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the doctor did not move. Instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">he kept on playing, calm, happy, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect good humor. His very coolness</seg><seg type="columnLine">nettled me; from dislike T was rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">running into hatred. My hands shook with</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire for action. If he were a vampire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wanted to know it, and to know it</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Why this everlasting delay and these in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fernal cards?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was cutting, when the first sign came,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I shall never forget it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a sensation, a feeling I wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">94</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">never again to experience. For the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time 1 knew that 1 was playing with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">power behind the conception of man; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was eating with the devil and was using</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short spoon. It was like a wave; my</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage vanished and my confidence was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. When I looked up the doctor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">peering at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lord, what eyes! Cavernous, flaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the most unholy light of ages! With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cry of horror I dropped the cards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor said not a word; his whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">body seemed to shrivel and become head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that in turn to transform and disinte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grate and to slowly reform and grow into</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, immense and terrible, two great</seg><seg type="columnLine">green fires, consuming, devouring, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What was it! What was it! A scream!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The eyes vanished; the doctor was sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting there before me. Yes, it was a scream;</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman's scream. How good it seemed! A</seg><seg type="columnLine">door slammed across the street; there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scurrying of feet. I was myself. I seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second roll and started for the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put down that paper!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the doctor who spoke.

Stop me</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you can!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a flash he was at me. Here I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself his master. Arms outstretched he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made for me and I could not help laugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at his awkwardness. Timing him to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dot, I let drive my left. It was a well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed blow, and I knew it for a knock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. He was coming head on when my</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow landed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Landed! Say, rather, entered, for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist entered his jaw like so much mist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed through his head and out the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unable to believe my senses, I shot out</seg><seg type="columnLine">my right. It passed clean through him. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see my fist out of his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a cry of horror I sprang out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his reach.

I screamed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The old man was after me like a demon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Aye, Hendricks!" he mocked.

But on this one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing she was very sure and very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, how glad I am that you men are</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to help Mr. Robinson!" she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Only I'm afraid, terribly afraid. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are not smart enough.

"But what's been done before can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be done again. 1 tell you for myself I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't afraid, he won't harm me; but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do care for this young man. He won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen to me. Says he's not afraid and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. But I tell you all quite frankly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor's not human. No, sir, he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">something else; when a man can do what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he does, he's something, and that ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">man either." With that she left us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a good deal in what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, and I told them so; but Smythe</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've heard of this Doreen case be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, Mr. Hendricks, read of it, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have always said I would have liked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been there. Now, here's our chance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We have Robinson over there, big and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong, athletic, no fool and no coward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we have a bunch of men around us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of them trained, all alert; and we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Green there in the house with them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a code of signals. Everything is in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor. We can catch the old fox red-handed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">save Robinson, and clear up the Doreen</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery, and all at the same time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE ALL of us settled down now to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our vigil. From our vantage ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an upper room we could look across into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room where, sure enough, sat Robinson</seg><seg type="columnLine">96</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and the doctor, both apparently enjoying</seg><seg type="columnLine">a friendly game of cards. It was not too</seg><seg type="columnLine">close nor yet so far but that we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">make them out quite plainly; the curtains</seg><seg type="columnLine">Were open and, of course, a great deal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room was in our plain view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, nothing happened. The minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew into hours, and as the first excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment wore away the time began to grow</seg><seg type="columnLine">lazy. 1 began to get sleepy. I think it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time after nine when Brooks nudged</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look! Look! What's Robinson doing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Across the street I could see Rob. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rolling up a paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Was it one or two?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I got up; but he seemed to laugh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay it down again, and to resume his</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing. Nothing more happened for about</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quarter of an hour; then suddenly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man started from his chair, pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand to his forehead, and in a startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">way began to talk to his companion. A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments later, after he had resumed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat, the door,opened, and we could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man and the old woman shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fists angrily at each other--at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old woman shook hers. Then it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Rob put the paper in the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah!" exclaimed Brooks. "Now there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">something doing over yonder! What'll we</seg><seg type="columnLine">do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beginning to be interesting," I an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered, getting up. "You stay here, Brooks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I get the men together. Keep a close</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookout. If Bob gives the other signal or if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see anything suspicious, be sure and</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal to us, and wre will break in immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Below I gathered up the men, placed two</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the back, two at the sides, and kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me two others. Every inch of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house was to be watched. The light was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window, and the house was silent. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time we waited; but there was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thumping of our hearts and the ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lasting pulsating throb of the city night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a little a window was raised, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Brooks' voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hendricks," he said coolly, "now is</seg><seg type="columnLine">your time. Enter quietly and make your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">way up to the room. You'll have your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man easy enough."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I had just reached the steps when a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woman screamed, and a frightened, fearful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cry it was, to be sure. And then, running</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and almost falling, I could hear someone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">coming down the stairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  W'ith a cry we made for the door; but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the same instant the housekeeper opened</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it, slammed it, and stood before us. She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was white and trembling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh," she cried, "for goodness sake,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hurry! Hurry! It's the devil! Sure, sure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it's the devil!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Woman," I almost shrieked, "look what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you have done! We are locked out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Burst it! Burst it open!" came an order</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was Brooks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Hendricks! Get in there! Get in there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">W'ith the force of two hundred pounds</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he landed against the door, and in a min-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ute we rolled, men, door, locks, and all, a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heap on the floor. The woman screamed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">again, and above everything I could hear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a voice familiar and distinct. It was Rob.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At a bound I threw myself to my feet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and dashed up the stairs. A light was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">streaming beneath the door, and there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was a peculiar noise coming from the in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">side, a sort of chuckle. Brooks passed me,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and both together we landed against the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">door. It was locked; we knew that, so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we sent it crashing to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The room wras empty!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VISITOR OR VISITATION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">WE WERE baffled, defeated!

My best</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">friend was gone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A sort of haze came over me, and for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the next few minutes I remember almost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nothing. Then I noticed the blaze of light,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the cards about the table, the empty wine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">glasses and bottles, and the soft green</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">carpet, while I could see Brooks dashing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about the room, stamping on the floor,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pounding the walls, and swearing a great,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">copious string of heavy oaths.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ALMOST IMMORTAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">97</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You below, therel" he shouted.

But it all ended as I had fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When gray dawn struck, it found a house</seg><seg type="columnLine">much like one stricken by an earthquake or</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whirlwind, but never a clue that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead us anywhere at all. Of course, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart-broken over Rob, and I swore by</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything that I knew that I would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave off the trail until I had either rescued</seg><seg type="columnLine">or avenged him. Nor was I alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brooks, with all his great confidence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid nonchalance of a few hours be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, was a thing to look at. Truly he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded me of a bloodhound chasing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail. With all his skill and technique he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting nowhere. When daylight came he</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw up his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I tell you, Hendricks, this is not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">case; it is a study, and I must have time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think.

But I tell you one thing;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will never leave this case until either I</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the doctor get each other."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anyway, we ate. And afterward we re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and began our search all over again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And we kept it up day in and day out, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be doubly sure, we rented the place and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved into it. And we watched and waited,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the days grew into months, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">months into years, until I found myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">five years older with a great practice and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a greater mystery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I HAD attained by hard, grinding work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think, a very credible place in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">legal world. I was not married, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">living with Brooks in the House of Mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery, as he chose to call it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We kept a housekeeper--none other than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old Mrs. Green, who had held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same position under our spooky friend the</seg><seg type="columnLine">notorious Dr. Runson, for whom the po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lice of every city of the world were looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not finding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was one great, permeating idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the house; find the doctor, avenge</seg><seg type="columnLine">Robinson, and clear up the Doreen mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brooks worked on the case as one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would work on a puzzle.

It was in September.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had been out to a social affair, and did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not get in until about eleven o'clock. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">I turned on the light, Brooks was snoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">loudly, his head back and his mouth wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, as though he were enjoying it. T</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled into bed with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How long I slept I do not know; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I awoke some time after with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">98</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">start, it was to find Brooks, or at least</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I thought it was he, sitting on my feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Like any sleepy person, I became angry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hey, you! Gee whiz! Brooks, get off</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my feet!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Someone at my side turned, and I saw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it was Brooks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What's the matter with you?" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I'm not on your feet.

I raised myself to a sitting posture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was Rob who spoke, and it was the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">old voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Is this really you, Rob," I asked doubt-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fully, "or just something else?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You think me a ghost, don't you, Hen?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Well, to tell you the truth, I am, almost;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at least, as near one as a man could get."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then--then you are not dead, Rob?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No," he answered, "I'm not dead, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive either, for that matter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got up and walked about the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I noticed that his walk was ghostlike,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no noise, absolute silence, and he nearly six</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and one hundred and eighty pounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here, Hendricks." He stopped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at the clock. "I've got but a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments to spare.

My mind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a whirl, and my heart was beating like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trip-hammer; but in the midst of it all I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had presence enough to analyze his fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures. The eyes were the same; the hair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jaw, and the peculiar expression of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mouth were all his; beyond a doubt it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Robinson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I remember the wild joy that surged</seg><seg type="columnLine">through me at the certainty. I reached up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to grasp him, but he drew back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't, Hen! Don't! Not now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drew back; for, not to be denied, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sprung out of the bed and was pursu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him with outstretched hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I would not.

Good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">by!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a good deal of the defiant in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words, and yet a world of misery.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors were locked, the windows fastened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and everything was found in its accus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomed place. We could get no satisfac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion; there was no solution but one; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I was no believer in ghosts or their</seg><seg type="columnLine">workings, I was loath to accept it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, what other solution could we give?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was either that, or we had, both of us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the victims of a huge hallucination,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we were, both of us, too much awake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had altogether too much pride and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidence in our own intelligence to admit</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we could drift off into a state so bor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering on the insane as that. How, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were we to account for it? I admit I tossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up my hands. It was too much for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Rob was not dead, and he said he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't, how had he gained entrance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our room? Surely none but a fan tom could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done that, and no one mortal could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have vanished in such a complete and</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous manner. Furthermore, if alive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what reason had he for keeping himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden, especially from his best friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, whose help he needed, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he had just now sought assistance?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could see none. But one thing I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. I cursed the impatient haste and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason with which I had just acted. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">it not been for my own foolishness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of tact, we might have had a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">good practical clues on which to work. Rob</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have had something to impart, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would never have paid us this visit, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I reasoned with Brooks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pshaw!" said my friend. "The man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">murdered. That's plain as day. WTho did</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is the goal. The case has just begun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I'm going to solve it, believe me. Mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, I'm going back to bed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Going to bed and going to sleep were two</seg><seg type="columnLine">different things; so we spent the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night in argument and in the consuming</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of innumerable cigars. And when the morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing broke and the gray light of dawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">streamed through the windows, it found</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men with two different views. I for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the living, and he for the dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Which of us was right you shall see for</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I WAS engaged on the Huxly case, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which you and everybody else who</seg><seg type="columnLine">reads the papers must be familiar.

I don't know how to account for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, but I have always said that the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">and important changes of life are prone</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come upon us suddenly and unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And although I have always made it</seg><seg type="columnLine">a habit to watch the turning up of things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it were, it has ever been my fortune to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be caught like a drowsy sentinel, asleep at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the post. How little was I aware at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. Everything was in the routine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The world was running smoothly; so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, in fact, that I had to satisfy my crav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for excitement with market reports.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It may have been the print, or it may</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been anything.

A flickering and flashing of lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamored with myriad tattoo across my</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain, and my head swam. I opened my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes again and reached for a glass of water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The paper was still in my hand; but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an inky black, the light of absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothingness, and clean across it, in plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">white letters, was the word:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROBINSON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Premonition," you say.

I repeated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Just this.

Eh? Might have been twins but</seg><seg type="columnLine">for thirty years or so. Eh! Well, I tell you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Hendricks, you needn't worry.

How would you like a busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness associate?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He staggered me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, an assistant if you will.

Even though my name may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be just plain Ebenezer Jones."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WrELL, to make the matter short, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">took him in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a rather sudden and strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to do on such a short acquaintance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was a little surprised at myself at first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but soon found that I had made no mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take. Indeed, before many days I was shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hands with myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ebenezer settled into my office with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease and a confidence that could only come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from ability and energy; and he tore into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cases with a vim that was irresistible. 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">had asked him whether he knew anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the law. I was soon laughing at my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was there anything about the law that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he didn't know! That fellow was a veri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table encyclopedia. He seemed to have it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all in his head. He became the brains of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office. I might well enough have burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">my books. I began asking questions, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon quit referring to my library. I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was useless; all I got was a verification</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his statements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Naturally I prospered. We won the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huxly case hands down, although I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was Ebenezer's brain and not mine that</seg><seg type="columnLine">did it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, I got the credit, so I had no kick</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming. Other cases came our way. We won</seg><seg type="columnLine">them all. It was so easy that it was amaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I congratulated both myself and him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fudge," he said. "It's nothing. There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to the law but the knowing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I guess he was right. Anyway I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in high spirits. My reputation was bound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up. I became a boy again. Success</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeds dreams; I could see great pictures</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, if I could keep this genius at work;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would be chief justice!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mystery?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had grown so old that I was beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to despair of it. I had, to be sure, a rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less feeling, a sort of nervous certainty</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it would be cleared up some day; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had become so used to waiting that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become a sort of habit; I was helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">and could do nothing, and there was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope. Of one thing I was certain--Robin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son would show up some day, somehow; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of subconscious wisdom seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> W'as it the mystery that held Ebenezer?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It must have been; though what he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to gain by sitting in my office, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">how he was going to solve it by doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing, I could not make out. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one clue, and that was his resem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blance to Rob. When I questioned him</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it he always laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I were Rob, I think you would know</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, Hendricks.

Then, after a while, after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good many minutes of silence and think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing: "You'll have to wait, old boy. Only, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you, things may happen, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they do, keep your wits about you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But nothing happened in spite of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Days wore into weeks and weeks into</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, and we dug into the laws. Eben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ezer was at it early and late; and I did my</seg><seg type="columnLine">best to keep up with him. I offered him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">partnership, but he refused it. When I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to have a moneyed understanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">he laughed at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have so much of that stuff that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">nauseates me. I prefer to work for nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see what turns up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had no bad habits that I could no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tice, and I watched him closely. He always</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought a bottle of port wine with him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drank it all during the day; that is, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not help him with. Also he smoked</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasionally; only it was an old, seedy</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe, such as you would expect an Eben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ezer Jones to smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was only one thing in his habits</seg><seg type="columnLine">or possessions that could arouse my curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osity; that was a small case which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">always carried with him; it was not more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than three inches square and could be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veniently carried in his pocket. The first</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he did on entering the office was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock this in his desk. And when he left at</seg><seg type="columnLine">night it went w'ith him without fail. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">he opened it quite accidentally, and I no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticed with surprise that it contained two</seg><seg type="columnLine">small bottles, both of them full of a liquid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the color was of port wine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They say it was Pandora who opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">box. Of a certainty that mythical young</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady was an ancestor of mine. T can under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand her feelings exactly; they must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been tantalizing. Something told me I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">open that box. Of course I revolted against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feeling; I fought it fiercely; all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ethics of my nature and training warned</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and pleaded with me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was no use. There was still that feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, perverse and ever there. My fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">itched, and my heart yearned for that case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Why I should have had it I could not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tell; it was a freak of my own nature or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand of Fate. My lower self seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound to triumph in this one case, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though my manhood and integrity kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying: "No, no; thou shall not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After all, what did it amount to?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would repeat. "Merely a case and two bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tles. Examine them and return them; no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one will be harmed, and you will be satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied."	*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, it went on that way for a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">many days, and all the time I felt myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing weaker. It was a trivial thing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself; but the fight I put up against it</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it, with me, a matter of some magni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At length I came to it. I resolved to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amine the case and in this way relieve my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self of this everlasting torment. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple thing in itself, and were it not for</seg><seg type="columnLine">its strange aftermath I would soon have</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO drops!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EBENEZER had stepped out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office for a few minutes, leaving his</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk unlocked. It was quickly done. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped over to his desk, drew out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawer, and took therefrom the little case</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mystery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A slight pressure and the thing flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, disclosing the two small bottles I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it to contain. I remember wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">why the two bottles instead of one inas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as they contained the same liquid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But did they?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps they only looked alike. To satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fy myself I picked up one of the bottles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened it, and smelled. It had absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">no odor, and of course I dared not taste it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was full to the overflowing, and as my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand trembled somewhat, a drop fell on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wine-glass that was resting on the desk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I replaced the cork and was about to open</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other bottle when footsteps in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall--Ebenezer's feet--put a speedy end</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my investigation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a minute I had closed the case and</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed the seat at my own desk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ALMOST IMMORTAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">103</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello," said Ebenezer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He placed his hat upon the desk and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking the wine-glass, poured himself a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large drink. Then in horror I recalled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spilled drop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Horrors! What is--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No use for more; it was done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first he stood stark still, his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising wonderingly to his head and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes questioning; then his frame shook and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his color began to change, first to a yellow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then to a dark green. He was the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncanny thing I ever looked at, a being</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped from another planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mercy!" he exclaimed. "It is done!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then with a furious haste he tore open</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desk and seized the case and vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the dressing-room. I could hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock crash as he turned the key. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell; but he must have risen immediately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I could hear someone walking. Then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice--no, a cry, and how it rang!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the name of Heaven, Hendricks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the door!

Hurry, hurry, break it</seg><seg type="columnLine">down!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a cry of fury I flung myself at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. It held.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurry, hurry!" came the despairing</seg><seg type="columnLine">call from the other side. Then another</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice cut in:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut up and come here; I'm master</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something fell, and then there was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramping of many feet. A struggle seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be going on, and above it all the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men--not two nor three, but of a multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude. In the midst of my frantic haste I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear it. Awful, excited, despairing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the incoherent shoutings of all nationali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties. German, Greek, French, Italian. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">above it all the voice of a master.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This way; this way! There now; there</seg><seg type="columnLine">now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a perfect frenzy of haste I seized an</seg><seg type="columnLine">implement and splintered the door and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it fell back, sprang into the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No, not quite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ebenezer Jones was standing at the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow watching the street below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why," he smiled, "you must be in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hurry, Mr. Hendricks.

I was about to become a hero; I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came crashing through the door ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grapple with a multitude, and instead I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was laughed at. Humbly I drew my hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kerchief and mopped my face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Excuse me, Mr. Jones," I ventured;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but I--I surely heard strange noises in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this room."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Strange what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Noises."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tut, tut, Hendricks." He came over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and laid his great brawny paw on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. "W'hat noises did you hear?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why," I said, "I heard, or thought I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard, my dear old friend Robinson.

You had the door</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                               t</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">locked, so I smashed it down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see you did," picking it up and plac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it against the wall. "But you didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">find Rob, did you? Nor the others? Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain old Ebenezer Jones!" He laughed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slapped me on the back. "Just plain old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ebenezer Jones. WThat do you know about</seg><seg type="columnLine">that? Isn't it awful?" And he went off into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peal of laughter, and laughed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed and laughed. "Hendricks," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you should have seen yourself come</seg><seg type="columnLine">through that door. Oh, how funny it was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You should have been a soldier; you'd be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a general!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that is how it ended; humiliated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shamed, and doubting, laughed at and half</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing at myself, I returned to work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I had a feeling that after all I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, and not such a big fool as Ebenezer</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones would have me believe. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling grew. It was not long before it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a conviction, and conviction brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I began to see the light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EBENEZER went to work as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing had happened. So did I. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, after the peculiar experience through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had gone, I began to take a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest in my strange companion. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">104</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hours I watched him wondering and figur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. From now on he was an enigma, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">open question-mark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had taken him at first for a queer char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acter, one of those strange personages of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom we have so many in our midst, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a mere whim or for love of any kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of adventure will adapt themselves to any</seg><seg type="columnLine">place or person in order to watch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">course of events and be in on the denoue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. That he had more than a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest in the disappearance of Rob I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not dreamed hitherto. I had taken him for</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he looked, and now I felt myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">deceived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once on a train of new thoughts I</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked fast. Why his resemblance to Rob?</seg><seg type="columnLine">W'hence this almost uncanny knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the law, this almost unhuman legal mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which knew everything, and which cared</seg><seg type="columnLine">so little for its rewards? Why his total dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like for money, society, and honor? Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too--and I reasoned it over many, many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times--the two small bottles?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And why -- yes -- the one bottle -- one</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop, the sudden effect, the noises, the mul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titude, and Rob?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not a nice feeling, to be sure;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but just the same, far from being ashamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what I had done, 1 was resolved on</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing the same trick over again on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first opportunity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From now on I watched and waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly for the little packet of mystery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once he took it from his pocket and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to lay it on his desk when something</seg><seg type="columnLine">diverted him, and he gave it a steady,</seg><seg type="columnLine">studious look, something akin to wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, it seemed to me, and with a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange motion snapped it back into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he looked over at me. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange look, something I could not under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand; there was something of power and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet of a strange, terrible weakness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Could it be that this man was a fiend?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ah, no! The answer came back with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same thought. Surely not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet all through that day and several</seg><seg type="columnLine">more that followed there was a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling between us, and at times I could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">feel his eyes upon me, a most uncomfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able thing. I had the impression of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared and watched by a wonderful, su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perior power; I don't know that there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything more uncanny than that. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weaker will you at least know that you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">the master; but when a stronger begins to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, the resultant fear that it engenders in</seg><seg type="columnLine">you is so haunting and depressing that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">becomes horrible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not that he was not the same Ebenezer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was that, and he wasn't. The outward</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance and actions were the same; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the psychological that changed. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a shiftiness, a changing; the eye spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lie, and the personality seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluttering. I don't know of anything that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have moved me more or set me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking harder. There was fear, appeal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and terror in those eyes. I felt that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being called on and that action was needed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hallucination," say you?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it seemed to me; but it was so real,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so earnest, and I was so certain of it that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing would have diverted me. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">would I do, and how would I do it? There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that in those eyes which told me I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do something. I was convinced that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene in the dressing-room was a real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity, not a fantom of my own mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were, there must have been many</seg><seg type="columnLine">people in that room. It was Ebenezer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret, and it should be mine. Show a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">that which he can't have; and that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall have. There was but one way--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottles. I would try them again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I said, to all outward appearances</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ebenezer was the same. He had the abil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity, the jovialness, the personality. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only in the shifting individuality of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes with their appeal, their fear, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">resultant effects that he was at all different</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the first Ebenezer that had entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">my office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His manners were the same, his talk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his application; he still drank his bottle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">port, and he still went out for walks. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning he deposited the little case inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">his desk, and every time as regularly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went out, it went with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How I did watch that case! How I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">ALMOST IMMORTAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">105</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">want to lay my hands on it! But there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no use; I could not take it away from him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must work in secret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One morning, a very momentous one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, Ebenezer was late. He had a right, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sure; for who has not when he works</seg><seg type="columnLine">for nothing? However, he had always been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so prompt before that I noticed with sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise this one slip of punctuality; and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more surprised, nay, almost alarmed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he jarred open the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was an appearance of one who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been out all night; his eyes were blood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot and his hair had a sort of stand-up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-refuse-to-lie-down look, although it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been well flattened with the brush. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand he carried a bottle of port; in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other I noted with surprise the case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without noticing me--wre were always</seg><seg type="columnLine">very cordial with our greetings--he walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to his desk more like a soldier than</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything and deposited thereon the bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There, now," he said, and without</seg><seg type="columnLine">another word turned on his heel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">marched out of the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few moments later I saw him entering</seg><seg type="columnLine">a building on the other side of the street.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was an act of finality about it that</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled me; a sort of defiance that un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerved me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was it a challenge? Anyway, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WTTH a feverishness that was a mix-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of fear, hope, and eagerness I</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed open the cover. There they were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two of them. Small, small receptacles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mystery: What did they not contain?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My hand trembled and my mind blur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">red. Here was one of the mysteries of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world; a secret of many things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I--I must see, must hear, and must</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. I held them up and examined them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah," I muttered, as by inspiration, "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dose and the antidote. Ebenezer, this is</seg><seg type="columnLine">your Waterloo. See." I almost laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with glee. "One drop raised hell. Two drops</seg><seg type="columnLine">will raise more hell." I poured two drops</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his glass. "So. And now, old boy, I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">say checkmate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With this I took out the other bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and placed it in my pocket. Then I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed the first bottle and put the case</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I had found it. When all was ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">I returned to my desk and took up my</seg><seg type="columnLine">work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What a difference there was. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">former occasion I was all excitement and</seg><seg type="columnLine">guilt; I felt I had committed a crime and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ashamed of myself. I had lost all</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor and self-respect. And now, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited, I had a feeling of triumph, of cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty, of right. I was dead sure. I was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument of Providence. And I remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered Ebenezer's own words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Things may happen; and when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">do, keep your wits about you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, I had them about me, now. Also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had a hammer to batter down the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">if necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After what seemed an age, Ebenezer re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wrell," he said, "how's things?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine," I answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's good. Same here. Was out late</seg><seg type="columnLine">last night; first time for a long while."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Theater?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, no. Just going around. Made me</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep late, though. Actually, I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">this morning I could sleep for a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. Have some?" He produced his bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle and poured himself a good drink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not this morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was hoping he would not insist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, here goes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He held it up, eyed it for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then drank it at a gulp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So," I said, and raised from my seat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was just as I expected. He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickly and was powerless. The two drops</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done the business His eyes were--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heavens, what eyes they were! The most</seg><seg type="columnLine">unholy thing I had ever gazed into--</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavernous, burning--defiant; the eyes of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost soul at the bar of judgment. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his hands to the sides of his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At last!" he said. "At last!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, oh, the finality of those four words;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the despair!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, with furious haste, he tore open</seg><seg type="columnLine">106</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his desk.

"This is murder!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in a flash of thought he was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressing-room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AZEV AVECJ</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ENDRICKS!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The cry came out. Rob's voice!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A terrific struggle was going on; all hell</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be breaking loose. I made for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door with the speed of fury. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">an age. From inside came the old voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the master s voice, and it said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "111 kill you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, oh, the struggle! There were blows</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hate, and above all the screaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">staccato of many tongues. Hatred, despair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">revenge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bang!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I let the door have it right in the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. It shivered and caved, the middle part</seg><seg type="columnLine">demolished. Bang! I struck at the hinges.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a crash it fell to the floor, and over</seg><seg type="columnLine">it I sprang into the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I live I shall never see it again! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was full of humanity. Naked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling they were rolled into an inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricable mass. There was hissing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gnashing of teeth. And in the center in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst of it all was a horrible thing. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was battling the multitude. Such a strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gle I had never seen before. It heaved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought, shoved, and struck, and still they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came on. If it were not master it was giv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a good account of itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, by a gigantic effort, it raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself up, flung back its assailants like so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many flies, and made straight for me. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes--a monstrous thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You!" it hissed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a cry of horror I backed against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall. Its hand touched me and I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">my body grow cold as ice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not yet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A form flashed between us and a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped its throat.

As you value your</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, back!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he sailed into it. Their forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckled together, heaved and tossed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air. They passed in and out of each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other like mist. The others came to help,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but their actions were slow and aged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such a struggle I shall never see again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can see myself yet, crouched against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall watching that battle of fan toms. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too bewildered to be afraid, too horri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied to analyze. Like a dream I was pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive, unable even to think.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly there was a heaving and toss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and the form of Rob shot into the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He and the thing were locked together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When they came down Rob was on top.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The battle was over. The thing lay still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rob backed away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Behold the end of Azev Avec."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It shuddered and rolled over and lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">up its head. I saw it was akin to a man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only black and terribly aged. It seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be shriveling. From its ghastly mouth came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Robinson," it said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Rob stepped closer and then knelt down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What is it, Azev?" And his face grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind and pitiful. One could see that if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had any resentment it was buried in pity</seg><seg type="columnLine">for what had to be done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Goodby, Robinson.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the time his form was shriveling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice growing fainter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There now," said Rob, drawing away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Doreen, come on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From out of the mass of shadows step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped a form.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now then, Hen, open the door and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">your office.

At last you've published the</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine I have been waiting for, and you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">done a mighty fine job at that. My greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">criticism is that you issue it only every other</seg><seg type="columnLine">month. That's hardly being fair to your readers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, I feel sure the success you no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have will make it possible for you to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">us Famous Fantastic Mysteries every month</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a short time. The title is well chosen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hesitated to clip the coupon on the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">page because I want to save the magazine in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact--and I save very few magazines. Besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coupon hardly gave me space to say the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things I wanted to say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It's hard to select my favorite story, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">every one being far above the average. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moon Pool", "Karpen the Jew", "The Girl in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Golden Atom", and "The Witch-Makers"</seg><seg type="columnLine">all run a close race for first place, "The Moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pool" having, perhaps, a slight edge on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. All of these seem to follow closely the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion implied by the magazine's title, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the quality of mystery is somewhat lack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in "The Girl in the Golden Atom."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Space Station No. 1" seemed just another</seg><seg type="columnLine">science fiction story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The Whimpus" and "Blind Man's Buff",</seg><seg type="columnLine">also struck me as not being in strict keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the title of Famous Fantastic Mysteries</seg><seg type="columnLine">although the latter story was quite amusing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, I rather resented the humorous touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a magazine of this type. If you must include</seg><seg type="columnLine">humor, please hold it down to a single story</seg><seg type="columnLine">each month.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In regard to the type of story I'd like to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">in future issues, I suggest that you stick to ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">like "The Witch-Makers", "The Moon Pool",</seg><seg type="columnLine">and "Karpen the Jew". These tales are definitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual and well in keeping with the magazine's</seg><seg type="columnLine">title. Exclude stories the likes of which we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">find in a dozen or more other publications. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">short, give us the stuff that's hard to find else-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whatever you do, don't change the cover. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is now it adds a great deal of character to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of the magazine, character that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be considerably lessened should you re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort to a pictorial cover; then the magazine</seg><seg type="columnLine">would become just another fantastic fiction pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lication instead of something new and refresh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly different.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As you see, my criticisms are few. Famous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fantastic Mysteries give me exactly what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've been waiting for. I think you've done a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grand job. Keep your magazine on the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">high level of quality and I'll remain a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoted reader.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">L.

The idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind Famous Fantastic Mysteries is splen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">did--even if the title is not. The stories in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sept.-Oct. issue were all excellent reading. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">a science fiction enthusiast, I would naturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to see the classic type of story predominate</seg><seg type="columnLine">--though whether it is a Merritt type, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty of imagination, or a story like Wellman's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more rigidly scientific, I do not care. The super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural stories are o.k., but only in small doses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All in all, the magazine is a very good one;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I have a few criticisms and suggestions to</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer. In the first place, stories as recent as</seg><seg type="columnLine">1936 should not be used. Why not make 1934</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limit?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Secondly, I'd like to see the magazine pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lished monthly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thirdly, and this is most important, please</seg><seg type="columnLine">use some serials.
