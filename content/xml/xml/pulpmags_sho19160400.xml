            <seg type="columnLine">ordinarily conceives himself to be appointed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of heaven to remove objectionable charac-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ters. The murderers of our Presidents have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been paranoiacs who believed themselves</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fulfilling a high and godly duty. But here</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">is a man who acts from the reverse motive.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Sane in most respects, the monomania ob-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sesses him that he is the ruler over Hades,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and that he must fight the legions of good.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">This was the theory that forced itself upon</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">who had founded an asylum for homeless</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">children. Here was typified Charity. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">second victim was a child--standing for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Innocence. The candy-poisoning was per-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">petrated with the idea of torturing and put-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ting to death more than one little child who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">might get the dosed buttercups. This</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">maniac had secured some of these candies,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">poisoned them, and smuggled them back</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into the containers on the counter. A simple</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">expedient for the cunning but cruel mind of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a paranoaic. Then followed the assassina-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tion of the clergyman, who was a godly man,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">you remember, representing Faith. Next</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">through the air like a comet stung by a wasp</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was the Last Dollar, and we could see all</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">had been left standing right where it was.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">There were a couple of derricks and a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was, standing right in front of the bunk-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">would be too scared to put up a fight. It</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">looked as easy to him as stealing a girl at a</seg>
