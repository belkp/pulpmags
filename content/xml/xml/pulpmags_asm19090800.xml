        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Since he had found the revolver, no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">doubt existed in Phil's mind that Hugh</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was guilty of the crime. And he rea-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">soned just as his friend had done--that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Donna was a secondary consideration to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the treasure where Hugh was concerned.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Vengeance upon a friend was out of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the question. He, Philip Bemis, would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">never be a witness against him. But to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">assist him in his conspiracy to marry the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Under normal circumstances, neither</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would have believed the other guilty of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the crime; and, 110 matter how strong</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the evidence, each would have gone</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">frankly to the other, demanded his word</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as to his guilt or innocence, and stood</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by him in either case.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But the girl was there, and the in-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Phil was honorable enough. He</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">plain Hugh's guilt, and ask her to come</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">under his own protection, would be like</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">offering a home to a friendless child.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">So, now that Hugh was safely on the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">take the motor-car away, yet speak no</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The reason he evolved was a flimsy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">one, and he knew it. But it was the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">best he could think of, and it would</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He lifted his somber eyes to Donna,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">"The theory is this," he explained;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">"you can't cook an egg to can it, or you</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have boiled eggs. The egg must be</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">011 the outside; sterilize the fruit, kill the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">"There's only one way to do it--that's</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">them into a retort and exhaust the air--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">air contains germs. The eggs have first</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been partly sterilized by dipping into a</seg>
