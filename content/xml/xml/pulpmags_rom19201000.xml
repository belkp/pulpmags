With decision gone from him, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom she had always looked to decide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From that moment, in short, he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">different Blackstock. Not only his wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">found him so but the neighbors as well. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">moped from morning till night. He spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours out on the rock, regardless of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather. Neighbors saw him there in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain and shook their heads sadly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't start his plows or lift a finger toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next year's crop. Neighbors were</seg><seg type="columnLine">briskly and blithely busy turning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubble, but Blackstock's fields lay fallow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor did he preach. The word went up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down that there would be no preaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the schoolhouse, and that was a sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">more disquieting than the others. Neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bors whispered among themselves. Black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock was an old man. He was breaking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He couldn't last forever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THESE days there registered at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Epsom Hotel in Epsom a certain John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Waldo Finch. He had come up into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">country to sell stock in oil wells in Okla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">homa. Good crops bring a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things in their wake. Farmers so blessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">are themselves a harvest white for the sickle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the laborers are never few. Like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flock of hungry buzzards the tribe of agents</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled down on Saskatchewan that year,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with anything and everything to sell from</seg><seg type="columnLine">enlarged portraits to Florida lands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finch was smooth. He didn't go about</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a lordy car. Neither did he wear a silk</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat and kid gloves. He dressed and acted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and talked like a farmer. He could tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">tales likely to interest farmers, of ranchers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Nebraska who hogged down their corn</seg><seg type="columnLine">to save the cost of husking it and of cattle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in Texas and Arizona who found it</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid to build up their stock by turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose on the ranges thoroughbred sires cost-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as high as ten thousand dollars a head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course he was leading up to his own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose but he led them so adroitly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">when at length he opened out his maps and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to talk business, the neighbors were</seg><seg type="columnLine">prejudiced in his favor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He represented the Penguin Leases. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Penguin Leases had taken over some thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands of acres of land within sight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous Black Panther well. Black Panther</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an established name--it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">much in the newspapers, and though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbors weren't greatly given to reading,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they already knew about the well and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing record of production. Finch had</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him the reports of experts to the effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the geological formation under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">property of the Penguin Leases was fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">as promising as that from which the Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">Panther poured forth its fabulous riches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finch wasn't lacking in originality.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With homely eloquence he enlarged upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the risks of farming. That was a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">string, and he harped upon it more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just once in five years," he pointed out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you have had a crop.

I will sell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you stock in the Penguin Leases for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollar a share. In a few years, perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a few months, depending on the rapidity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of development, it will be worth ten dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">a share--or twenty dollars--or even one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred dollars--and all the while you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be drawing dividends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you put your money back into your</seg><seg type="columnLine">farms, you'll throw- it away. Put it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">oil and it will be like bread cast upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters. Mind you, I don't deny that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is money lost in oil but for every dollar</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost in oil, there's ten dollars lost in farm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing--or more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was eloquent and adroit, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbors were canny. They w'ere im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed but not convinced. They recom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mended Finch to see Blackstock. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tradition of their race to put trust in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man whom the Lord had called to preach.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To him they ascribed an insight beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own.

When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finch spread out his maps, Blackstock re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garded him and them intently, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHOM THE LORD LOVET H</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Finch opened the flood-gates of his elo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quence, Blackstock listened without miss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But his aspect was ominous and his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiries were more so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If your project promises such profits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why," he asked, "do you come up here to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sell stock?

Neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bors missed the sermons, for they were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pious folk. They kept up the Sunday-</seg><seg type="columnLine">school and every Thursday night they got</seg><seg type="columnLine">together for prayer, but no such devices,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they were good in their way, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the place of the preaching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was quiet talk of having some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body else come out from Epsom.

She seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow stronger under her trials and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerful. They could scarcely get a word</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of Blackstock, but the woman talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">and visited with them as if there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing amiss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Silsbys were nearest, and a glorious</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft evening in February, with a full moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">to light them on their way, they drove over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take supper and spend a few hours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Silsby, since the big crop, had been taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">a daily newspaper from Winnipeg, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fairly bursting with the things he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to tell.

Also I fear that, as yet, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">tale has held far more shadow than sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shine. Therefore, for the sake of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who have borne with me this far, as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as for my own, I will strive to be brief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Three days after Christmas Papa Ton</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned, disheveled, ill and empty-handed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, Toinette, Toinette, what can I say</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you?" he cried as he crept overside. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just like the last time, only worse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And through it all I thought of you so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had to keep on to drown my shame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is always your face that I see at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the glass, Toinette--your face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it will look upon my return."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Toinette, her eyes a blur of love</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pity, could only grip him hard about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his great neck and answer:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bien, Papa Ton. You are back again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at any rate. In with you now and to bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">until you are yourself once more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slinking to the hut in silence, the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">man lay as one dead for two nights and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. At the end of this time he arose and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having gulped down an enormous meal, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed the burden of the marsh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At sight of my skins he was loud in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">praises, declaring that he himself could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done no better. Also he insisted uppn</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividing equally with me, a thing which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stoutly refused to allow. In the end he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave in, turning his back that I might not</seg><seg type="columnLine">witness the emotion born of his gratitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Jean," he gulped. "Believe me, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not soon forget this. And remember,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are partners once the debts are paid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is your right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of his carouse he spoke to me but once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet there was a sermon in his few words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have seen?" he questioned the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment that we were alone. "Then do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not forget. If ever you would drink, fill</seg><seg type="columnLine">your first glass with poison itself. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be quicker for you and better for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones you love."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time Papa Ton spared his broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit no single stroke from the twin</seg><seg type="columnLine">scourges of remorse and shame. Never be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore had I know him so tender, so humble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so grateful for the slightest favor. He was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROl'VE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">like a child who, having committed an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed fault, is divided between wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gratitude at the punishment withheld.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, as in the case of his former defec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, he performed prodigies of work, harry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the marsh until the last penny of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">debt had been accounted for and the skins</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone up to the bridge, together with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second lot that was to replenish our larder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and settle the score of borrowed supplies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is to these days of contrition and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deavor that I love best to look back when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think of Papa Ton. Childish always, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this time became literally our charge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indeed, so great was his bewilderment, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">indecision, that had we not ordered him</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, I doubt that he would have got be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond a vague and helpless groping after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solution of his many difficulties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the first weeks of the new year passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">amid an atmosphere of love and pity which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite our need, rendered them the hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piest that I had known at Bayou Portage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, his debts paid and his system</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleansed of the poisons of the mainland,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Papa Ton began to develop his old rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessness and instability of purpose. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">along he had refrained religiously from any</seg><seg type="columnLine">mention of the camp below. Now uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciously his thoughts began to slip the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leash of his determination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So, Jean," he observed one night, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear that we have a newcomer in the per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son of your friend, M'sieu Dugas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few days later he remarked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They say that it is quite a place at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower camp. Bien, I must see for myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not as a customer, of course, but merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look around."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These were warnings not to be disre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garded, and in our despair we sent for Le</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bossu. ' Had he come at once, it is pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible that the danger might temporarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been averted. But by the time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little man's answer arrived, telling of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition to Lake Tasse and the obliga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of a newly formed partnership, Papa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ton had stolen off for a two days' stay at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon his return there was another debt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a debt that must be paid at once. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessitated a second trip below and a sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequent stay of another two days. Toinette</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I were aghast. It was even worse than</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had feared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After this we settled down to a hopeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight against the rapacity of Monsieur</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugas. Always was Toinette scrimping</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saving. Always was I tramping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marsh for skins that melted away down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream. And always Monsieur Dugas</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached out for more, grudging us the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">food that went into our mouths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first Papa Ton held rigidly to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">partnership, so that thert was always my</seg><seg type="columnLine">share of the skins to fall back upon. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">so importunate a creditor was Monsieur</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugas and so piteous was the big man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">need, that soon I began lending a skin-or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two to complete the required amount.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The result of this was inevitable. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the amount increased until the catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to go as a whole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now if I have made it appear that Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sieur Dugas was solely responsible for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">misfortune, I am fully justified. Each step</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Papa Ton's downfall went further to</seg><seg type="columnLine">convince me that it was not the big man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fault. As Toinette always said, he meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">well and tried hard. Indeed, had Monsieur</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugas merely let him alone, I doubt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his case would have been so desperate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Monsieur Dugas had not served his</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret bar for nothing. In the art of temp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation he was a past master. Did Papa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ton, poisoned and repentant, stay away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from below a week, lip would come a pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent in the shape of a small bottle. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">that bottle had been drained, Papa Ton</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beyond all power of persuasion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for Papa Ton, I can say of him that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through all this bitter time, never once did</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cause our love for him to waver. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways he was kind and gentle, and the love</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he returned us was like some living</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. That was the pity of it, the pity</seg><seg type="columnLine">that well-nigh broke our hearts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, Jean, Jean," Toinette would often</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry. "If only he would beat us! Then we</seg><seg type="columnLine">might hate him and it would not be so</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard. What are skins and food compared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his love?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus the year dragged itself out to hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather and our departure for the bay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This second Summer there were but</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of us upon the Toinette, for Le Bossu</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unable to join us. Again it was a part-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nership, the little man sending word that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be occupied until the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christmas, when we would see him without</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail. As a consequence Papa Ton made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonely, restless cruise, punctuated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">visits to the coffee-house of the coast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon our return to Bayou Portage long</seg><seg type="columnLine">ib	NEVIL G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in advance of cold weather, we faced a</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation which promised to be even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious than that of the season before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Early in the Summer young Pierre Valsan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife had deserted him entirely and young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pierre, returning to the camp, had sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">io drown his troubles in drink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His companionship was the one thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed to complete Papa Ton's ruin. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the lower camp had been at the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's elbow, Valsan's swift launch now</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed it in his very hand. Always the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two were slipping down the bayou, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times making a half-dozen trips in one day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon our case became truly desperate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the approach of Christmas there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no talk of the bridge. Never again, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed, would our skins find their way up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream. We could only hope that Le</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bossu, learning of our plight, would bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a stock of supplies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> . So we struggled on through the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks of the old year and then, with Christ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mas but four days off and the little man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival a matter of hours, the end came--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a terrible end that leaped upon us with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swift cruelty of the wild.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was late in the afternoon and, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">day's work done, Toinette and I had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the landing. Le Bossu had sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">word that he would arrive either that night</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the following morning, and Papa Ton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as usual, had gone with young Pierre to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had pleaded particularly hard with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that day, reminding him of Le Bossu's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival, but the big man had reached a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage where, if he fought temptation at all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he merely battled with weak excuses. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be right back, he declared. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not pleasure but business. Only let</seg><seg type="columnLine">him settle a small account, and he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave without lifting so much as a glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus, with two travelers to look out for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we kept watch both up and down-stream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also we spoke brightly of the days to come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tasting a happiness which was all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeter in that it had been long delayed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time in many months we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found a rift in the dark clouds of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future. Le Bossu was coming, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant not only freedom from want but an</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence that Papa Ton had ever been un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to withstand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And even should the little man fail</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time, we had a plan. It was a vague,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nebulous plan which involved our removal</seg><seg type="columnLine">__</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HENSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to some other camp, and as yet we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly dared to put it into words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course it was unthinkable, but if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst came to the worst, we meant to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with the help of Le Bossu. In all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marsh there was no other who would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">dared to suggest such a thing to Papa Ton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, Jean," said Toinette finally.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why twist our heads off trying to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">both ways at once? Let us make a game of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. I will look up and you will look down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the first to see boat or launch will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the winner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bien," I agreed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in the same breath I added--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Your choice was bad, for you have lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">already."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But that is only a pirogue," objected</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette as she turned to see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look beyond," I ordered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But still it is not the launch," persisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen-eyed Toinette. "It is a rowboat. No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are two boats. See how the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">glints between."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rising to my feet, I shaded my eyes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might the better pierce the gray of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching twilight. Now I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Toinette was right. There were two</seg><seg type="columnLine">skiffs, moving side by side, and ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, skimming at top speed, came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pirogue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indeed, so hard did the paddler drive his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strokes that he was within hail of us before</seg><seg type="columnLine">even I-could comment on his haste.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hola you," he shouted. "Bring help.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There has been an accident."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I started off obediently enough, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no need to follow' his instruction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Other eyes had been watching the bayou,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and already the partners were on the run,</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed closely by Father Lasalle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turning to Toinette, I found that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not moved. In her eyes was a look of</seg><seg type="columnLine">agonized impatience, and the hand she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched to her heart was gripped so fiercely</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the knuckles showed white through</seg><seg type="columnLine">their tan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, hurry, hurry," she begged. "Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment will mean so much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And why?" I asked, bewildered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is Papa Ton," she answered dully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I know, Jean, I know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her hand rose and came back with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thud as she added--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can feel it here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By now the pirogue had shot alongside</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the partners had seized its occupant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROMANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">2</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">&gt;7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" they questioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is your two from here, Laval and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valsan," panted the man. "They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind with drink. They were mad to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">that launch. From what I heard, the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gine would not start, and Valsan went for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward for gasoline with which to prime it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was smoking, and the tank exploded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so as to blow out, but in a great spout</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flame. Valsan fell stunned, and Laval</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged forward to save him. It was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over in a moment. We had put out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken them off in less than five minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the first flash. Valsan is badly</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned, but he will come out of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused and in the horror of that mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment it was Toinette who first found voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask the already answered question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And Laval?" she demanded as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">she feared the usual "Papa Ton" might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">misunderstood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man looked away. Evidently he</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood only too well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is bad," he muttered.

They have driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from the mainland and, if my ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">have not failed me tonight, he will fare no</seg><seg type="columnLine">better here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Also you need have no fear of M'sieu</seg><seg type="columnLine">the General. Had he meant you ill, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have heard from him long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Do you imagine that he has gone on</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ignorance of his grandson's whereabouts?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He has a long arm, that old M'sieu the</seg><seg type="columnLine">General. Some day he will reach out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, and it is of this that I am thinking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You are a fine youth, and it must be very</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonely on that hill-top. Suppose you try</seg><seg type="columnLine">again before laying your plans for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bossu," I flared. "How can you say</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a thing? Would you have me creep</seg><seg type="columnLine">back after having been driven away? Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, if the general were to come for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, I would not go with him. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do I care for that hill-top? I want you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette and all the other folk who have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been good to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the little man's hand went out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time in a clutch of silent approval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bien," said he after a while. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made your choice and I love you for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Nevertheless you are acting like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy that you are. In this world riches and</seg><seg type="columnLine">power are not to be despised. When you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are older, you will know. For the rest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I feel that I have done my duty by you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was not fair that you should go ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">with your eyes closed to the great chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that might be yours for the asking."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You need not have troubled," I put in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I will never ask. Even if I wished to, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not leave Toinette."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then your future is easily arranged,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Le Bossu. "Since you mean to stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Toinette, there is no need to consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">you further. Where she goes, you go, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is an end of it. As for Toinette's</seg><seg type="columnLine">going, that is a matter to be settled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Alcide, the sister of Papa Ton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of all the Lavals she loved Papa Ton best,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she will be sure to come when I send</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rising he added:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now in with you to Toinette's</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, where you must get such rest as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can. I will keep watch until morning."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rising also, I was about to go inside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I noticed that Le Bossu had paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stare intently down-stream. Following</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROMANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN T</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction of his gaze, I saw that for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short distance the sky was all glowing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a-quiver with flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The hunters," said I. "They grow</seg><seg type="columnLine">more careless each year.

"They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were preparing for it when I arrived. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have gone myself, had there been</seg><seg type="columnLine">any need."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And M'sieu Dugas?" I questioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little man shrugged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is his affair, although you may</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust him to look out for himself," he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied. "If he is wise, he will take to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marsh, slipping out to safety by way of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bay. Peaceful though I am, I would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to trust myself to keep finger from</seg><seg type="columnLine">trigger were I to see him coming up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bayou."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We watched until the glow had faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, leaving only a smudge of sullen red</seg><seg type="columnLine">that glowered like some dull, evil eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the shadowy reach of the grass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bien," muttered Le Bossu as he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. "It will be a long time before this</seg><seg type="columnLine">marsh sees a better night's work. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">pity is that it was not done before. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">us it is like the springing of an empty trap."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MADAME ALCIDE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE dawn of the following morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Le Bossu shook me awake and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried me off to breakfast with the La-</seg><seg type="columnLine">salles. For the present we would eat there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he explained, as we tramped the short dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance through the brisk, morning air. Also</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette would remain under the care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tante Odile until her future had been pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided for.	~</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arriving at the Lasalles, we found</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette waiting for us in the doorway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was very pale and very quiet and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our greetings she replied only with a low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Bossu? Well, Jean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterward she slipped back against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, standing rigidly in one spot until</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tante Odile called her to table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a cheery meal, that breakfast, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout its brief course it was enlivened</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. -- ROM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROUVE	21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">by the bright chatter of the little Lasalles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ordinarily Toinette would have made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of her opportunity, laughing and teas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing until she had produced a perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">pandemonium of merriment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now she sat as if frozen, deaf even to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">all-absorbing conversation of the elders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As was natural, the talk turned upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raid of the night before in which Father</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lasalle had played a prominent part. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had all been as simple as it had been com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete.	/</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Led by Dalfrey, the trappers had slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the bayou and had surrounded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee-house without so much as a word of</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposition. Having broken inside, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had smashed all the cases and bottles be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore setting fire to the building. After-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward they had stood by to see that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames did not spread to the other huts or</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the near-by marsh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each move had been carried out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the care and deliberation of a legal pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeding. There had been no noise, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowdyism. Of the large stock of liquor</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed, not one drop had been drunk by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the invaders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for Monsieur Dugas, he had risked no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance on a wait in the marsh. Evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been warned in advance, for he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken to his boat and had escaped down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream some time before the arrival of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men from the upper camps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was a lesson that will not soon be for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten," observed Father Lasalle. "Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will respect us here on the marsh. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course there is still the chance that Dugas</seg><seg type="columnLine">will make trouble for us. In that event we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can only plead the necessity of our course."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You may rest easy on that score," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured Le Bossu. "If you have broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">the law, Dugas has broken it also, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be forced to admit his guilt before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">can even so much as mention yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not until the last plate had been pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside did Toinette recover herself. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amid the clamor of the departing children,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she suddenly arose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am going home, Tante Odile," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced. "You promised that I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">go as soon as breakfast was over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And so you shall," began Tante Odile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Le Bossu broke in upon her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A moment," he interposed. "Before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">separate, we must consider our arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if the little man's words had recast</seg><seg type="columnLine">NEV1L G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HENSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her former spell, Toinette abruptly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed her seat. She made no protest either</seg><seg type="columnLine">by look or word. She was frozen again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," whispered Tante Odile from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the cover of her battered coffee-pot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She has been like that ever since she came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You must speak to her, Jean. You must</seg><seg type="columnLine">make her cry. She can .not go on like this."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So, Toinette," continued Le Bossu.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That is a good girl. And now for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first thing, which is the informing of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">father's family. To me it seems best that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we should at once send a message to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">aunt, -Madame Alcide. As for the others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are scattered wide, and there is little</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Also we can count upon Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide to notify them if she considers it</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth while. You agree with me in this?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette answered without raising her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know best, Bossu," she muttered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I only want to go home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then, since you leave it to me, I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">send to Bois Berard at once," said Le</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bossu. "With a fast launch we should re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceive an answer before sundown. Also I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will instruct Madame Alcide to put off her</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming until tomorrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It would be hard to make her com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable overnight, and there is little that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could do. For the rest, we can delay</seg><seg type="columnLine">our other arrangements until we hear from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, since their details will depend wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon her answer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rising, he added to me:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will take Toinette home, Jean. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will join you there, once I have arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the launch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little later, as I prepared to depart</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Toinette, Tante Odile called me aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Speak to her now, Jean," she urged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You may not have a better chance."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Accordingly, once we were outside. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">took firm hold upon my courage and spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Toinette. It was not an easy task, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was rendered especially difficult by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness that for the first time there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a sense of strain between us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Toinette," I began, "you must not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grieve so. You must-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I faltered to a standstill, and Toinette,</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoning her grief for pity, made haste</seg><seg type="columnLine">to answer me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bien, Jean," said she. "You need say</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more. I understand, and I will do my</seg><seg type="columnLine">best, if only for your sake. But do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect too much. Just now there is some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thing between me and everything. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps it is my sorrow. Perhaps it is death</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself. I do not know. When that some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing is gone, I will be myself again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She broke off to relapse into her former</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude of silent misery', nor did she speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me again throughout the dreary length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that endless day. Yet, now that 1 under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, I was strangely comforted. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how I knew that, once this nameless bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rier was removed, we would come together</seg><seg type="columnLine">again in perfect understanding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three hours before sunset the little man's •</seg><seg type="columnLine">messenger returned. He had made good</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, and his news was highly satisfactory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Alcide sent word that she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">set out for Bayou Portage at daybreak the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also she would bring with her the curt</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Bois Berard. The funeral could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged for midday, as she would cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly have arrived before that hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Le Bossu received these tidings with</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence of gratitude and appreciation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is what I expected," he declared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She is like that, Madame Alcide. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">years she has not seen or heard of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother, yet the moment she is called upon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she does everything in her power. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">the funeral will be a success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Also we must put our best foot forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is not often that a place like Bayou</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portage is visited by such a one as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">widow of Alcide Berard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That this impression became general was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon shown by the preparations that be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan and continued until sunset. Door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards were swept. Drying sheds were</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleaned of their litter and put in order.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Landings were tested and, through the driv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of a nail, were freed from the treachery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of loosened boards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon the Lasalles the burden fell es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecially hard, for in her capacity of sole</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostess of the camp Tante Odile found it</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to clean up inside as well as out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long after dark she swept and scrubbed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">assisted by Toinette, who alone remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">indifferent to the general bustle and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those cobwebs, Toinette." Tante Odile</seg><seg type="columnLine">would cry. "See, they are like a cast-net.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Out with them, and do not forget the smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind. Remember it is your aunt who is</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Toinette without a word would</seg><seg type="columnLine">march woodenly to the attack. Like Tante</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Odile she performed prodigies of cleanli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, but it was all done with the stolid un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness of a well-regulated machine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not once did she mention the coming of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her aunt. This event like all else remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the strange barrier that had shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">off her world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throughout the next morning the boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">put in at Bayou Portage. They began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrive with the first of the light, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">then on there was hardly a moment when</seg><seg type="columnLine">some craft could not be sighted upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bayou. In the night the word had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth, spreading from camp to camp with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mysterious swiftness which ever jvings</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tidings of disaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now from each nook and corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast the marsh-folk set out to pay a last</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribute to Papa Ton. That the big man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was well liked had been a matter of pride</seg><seg type="columnLine">at our camp. Not until now, however, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">we learn of the true esteem in which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been held by all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indeed, we were hard put to it to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for the visitors who arrived in an ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasing throng. Beginning with those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who lived near, the list extended until there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hardly a camp within striking-distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that did not have its representative.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men came from Cypremort, from Onion</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bay, from Isle Lapin, from the Hammocks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">little and big. There were hunters, trap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers, fishermen, oystermen; all the harriers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the coast, from those who matched their</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength against the great fish of the bay</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the aigrette-hunters--men who slew</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of beautiful and defenseless birds</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the sake of a single feather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having arrived and discussed the ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cident at the landings, they clambered up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank to fall gravely silent before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of the hut. Here their hats came off</seg><seg type="columnLine">and many, upon going inside, made a slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and solemn sign of the cross.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still silent, they paused for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the bunk where Papa Ton took his</seg><seg type="columnLine">last rest upon the worn blankets. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">they passed out to draw a great breath, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swear softly, to demand of those who stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">about if the big man had not been the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next, it was a visit to the last of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huts, where young Pierre had been left to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the care of his father. Here old Valsan</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuffled distractedly about, the one inhab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itant to catch a glint of silver in the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud that overhung the camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Indeed, in several ways it was a red-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">letter day for the old man. First, he had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">come into the public eye, an experience dear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the heart of even the humblest Cajun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Next, young Pierre had been well punished</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">both for his desertion and intemperance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Finally, the old man felt that his son was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">returned to him permanently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Immediately after the accident a mes-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sage had been dispatched to Madame</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pierre. She had replied by saying that if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her husband were in need of her care, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could come to her. Otherwise he must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trust to his friends, since under no circum-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stances would she leave the mainland.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Thus amid the general grief old Valsan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">approached a contentment that was wholly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">foreign to his crabbed nature. All day he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">held high court, now haranguing the visi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tors as to his son's mishap, now conducting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them inside to where, incased in a huge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cocoon of bandages, young Pierre twisted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">miserably beneath the sting of his burns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Lastly the visitors repaired to the La-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">salles, where Tante Odile, caught again in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the vortex of entertainment, strove hero-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ically to provide them all with the inevit-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">able black coffee. It was a miracle, that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">filling of the endless procession of empty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cups. Ten o'clock found the camp stripped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down to its last handful of berries, but its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reputation for hospitality had been sus-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Bien," sighed Tante Odile, when the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">final cup had rattled empty into its heavy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saucer. "We have won, but it was a close</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing. A little more and I should have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been forced to give them bayou water."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Thus the morning passed, until word</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came from the bayou-bank that Madame</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Alcide's launch had been sighted up-stream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">At once Tante Odile plunged into a frenzy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of final preparation, while Le Bossu, calling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to Toinette and myself, led the way to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">landings. The little man was plainly ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cited and, as we waited, he admonished us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">earnestly as to our behavior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Do not forget your manners," he kept</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">repeating. "You must show Madame Al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cide that even though you are of the marsh,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you know what is due such a visitor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The effect of this was to throw me into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a perfect torment of self-consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">For the first time I became aware of those</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">awkward penalties that attend a sudden</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">growth. At once I felt all legs and arms,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and I further discovered that my clothes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEVIL G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HENSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were very old and ragged and were also</seg><seg type="columnLine">several sizes too small for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toinette alone was undisturbed. Clad</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a white dress, over which Tante Odile</seg><seg type="columnLine">had labored patiently the night before, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared out over the water with the fixity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a statue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Dicu," muttered Le Bossu, interrupting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his admonitions. "This is too much. Will</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing move her?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he spoke, the launch rounded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud-flat and swung in toward the landing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In its stern, seated between the cure and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small brown-clothed stranger, was Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite the disadvantages of her posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, my first sight of Madame Alcide was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an imposing one. She was a large woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall and broad, yet without a suggestion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stoutness. Also there was about her an</seg><seg type="columnLine">air of stately repose, so Jhat even on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow, backless seat of the launch she</seg><seg type="columnLine">held herself comfortably erect. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in a plain black skirt, a loose black</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacque, and upon her head she wore a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunbonnet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This sunbonnet was the crowning touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her apparel. Not only did it proclaim</seg><seg type="columnLine">her caste. It went further and made pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible the dignity of her arrival. Seated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the launch in a bonnet or hat, she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely have appeared ridiculous. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunbonnet she was mistress of the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the launch slid alongside, she made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no movement of greeting or of recognition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Waiting quietly until the craft had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">made fast, she arose at a word from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions and allowed herself to be as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted on to the landing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was then that I had a look at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, a strong yet placid face, finely molded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">generously proportioned, and set with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of shrewd gray eyes. The mouth, firm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and straight, betrayed the character and</seg><seg type="columnLine">determination of its owner, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Alcide spoke, there was blended</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the graciousness of her tone a well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">defined note of authority.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is M'sieu Jean Le Bossu?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The little man made his best bow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At your service, madame."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have my thanks for all that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done, m'sieu," said Madame Alcide</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply. "And these, of course, are my</seg><seg type="columnLine">niece and the boy of whom I have heard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IZQ£</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bending, she kissed Toinette upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brow, after which she studied her intently</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, you are Oton's child," was her</seg><seg type="columnLine">verdict. "You are Laval all through."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In my fcase she contented herself with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pat upon the shoulder, yet I was well-nigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcome. Done by Madame Alcide, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like an accolade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are a big boy, Jean Trouve," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">she. "They could have had but little</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble in finding you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These greetings over, she bethought her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self of her companions. They stood as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sat, upon either side of her, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitors, drawn up in a rough semicircle</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the bayou-bank, regarded them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">frank curiosity. Observing this, Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide embarked upon a general introduc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pere Parmentier is, of course, well</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to you," she began, whereupon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cure stepped forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a small, wiry man, with vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue eyes and a great shock of snow-white</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair. As he advanced, he smiled as if in</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognition of many well-remembered faces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "M'sieu le Docteur Poussard," Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide next announced, and the brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger, clicking his heels together, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed a contortion that was half-bow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-military salute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like the cure he was small and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">also wrinkled, as a fruit is wrinkled after</seg><seg type="columnLine">long exposure to the elements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the rest lie was brown, in his dress,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his complexion, in the coloring of his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his scant thatch of hair. Even his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice gave one an impression of brownness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since it had the dry, crackling rasp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient leather. Yet, for all this, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing vivid or startling about the doetor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance. He was as natural as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">withered leaf in a Winter forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am honored, my friends," he declared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Also, in my capacity of physician, I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to do what I can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, Poussard," interrupted Mada'me</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide. "My poor brother is dead. He has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been dead for more than a day. A thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand doctors could not bring him back</seg><seg type="columnLine">again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She spoke without a trace of heat, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the doctor appear in any way to resent</seg><seg type="columnLine">her rebuke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later I came to know that their friend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was of a kind where even the greatest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROMANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">r-&gt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">frankness failed to give offense. Also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereas Madame Alcide always spoke to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor as Poussard, she invariably</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke of him as nt'sieu le docteur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having completed her introduction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Alcide turned to Le Bossu.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will see my brother first, m'sieu," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced. "Afterward we had best go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on with the burial. It is necessary that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">return home tonight, and we have much be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At once Le Bossu led the way, Toinette</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I following, and the cure and the doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor bringing up the rear. Passing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ranks of the silent and staring visitors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we arrived at the hut where Madame Alcide</seg><seg type="columnLine">knelt to a brief prayer beside the bunk be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore taking a last look at her brother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a long look, and when Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide spoke, her words contained a pity</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the power of expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So this is what he ran away to," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">she.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She choked silent, while two great tears</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered in her eyes and fell unheeded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come," she murmured. "I have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And she added as we left for Tante</seg><seg type="columnLine">Odile's--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Death is not so bad, after all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half an hour later the funeral started, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great affair that was the talk of the coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">for many a day. I recall it as a long pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cession of bareheaded men, led by one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little Lasalles who, clad in white robes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">held proudly aloft a golden cross. Back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the huts a grave had been dug in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clayey soil, and here the partners, Father</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lasalle and three chosen' men from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper camp lowered the rough box that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had carried so reverently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a still, warm day, and only w'hen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curt raised his voice in prayer did a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little breeze spring up. Then, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marsh-folk knelt in the sunlight, the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">great sweep of grass rustled slowly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemnly, as if each tiny blade bowed its</seg><seg type="columnLine">head in honor of a soul that was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of all the incidents of Papa Ton's fun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral I remember best that swaying marsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the rigid white face of Toinette, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the very last preserved her stony calm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So," said Le Bossu, when it was all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we had turned away. "It is right that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should be where he fought and won."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I understood why Papa Ton had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to lie in the marsh, holding in death</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot that marked his final victory over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ever encroaching grass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">X MOVE ON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE RETURNED to the Lasalles</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Madame Alcide, refusing all</seg><seg type="columnLine">offers of rest and refreshment, entered im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately upon a final adjustment of Papa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ton's affairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thank you, madame, but I seldom tire</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself," said she in reply to Tante Odile's</seg><seg type="columnLine">protestations. "As for food, I have neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time nor the heart for it just now. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is necessary that I be home tonight, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is much to attend to. With your per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission and with the aid of yourself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest, I will make my arrangements."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly, once Madame Alcide was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated in the best of the few, ancient chairs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others gathered round her--Tante</seg><seg type="columnLine">Odile, Father Lasalle, Le Bossu, the curt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Doctor Poussard. I sat with Toinette</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon one of the bunks, feeling very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a prisoner must feel who awaits the find-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of a jury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed a wholly unnecessary nuisance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this eternal settling of one's future. Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wondered, did they not let Toinette and</seg><seg type="columnLine">me go on as before? .We would miss Papa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ton terribly, but except for this we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">manage as well as ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some such thought must have troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette, for her hand crept into mine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You will not leave me, Jean? You will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not let them take me away?" she begged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was reassuring, but by now</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Alcide had begun to speak, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only squeeze the small, cold hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">in reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My brother, he left anything of value?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioned Madame Alcide, addressing Le</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bossu.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That depends upon what you mean by</seg><seg type="columnLine">'of value,' madame," he replied. "He leaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">a daughter and a boat, both of the name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette. Also there are some skins, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">traps and a few household effects. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is also the hut, but that must belong to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first one who cares to claim it. We know</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of rent upon the marsh."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused, while the cure appeared a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trifle dismayed, the doctor frankly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">NE V I L G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HENSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered. Madame Alcide, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed capable of a full appreciation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little man's quaint humor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well spoken, m'sieu" said she. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are as thorough as you are brief. That is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trouble with most of our people. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk too much. As for what my brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">has left, since you seem to consider the</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter named Toinette of chief value</seg><seg type="columnLine">and since it is only human for one to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sire the best of everything, I will take her</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A wise choice, madame," commented Le</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bossu. "Then she goes with you this</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She does," answered Madame Alcide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I have already arranged a place for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this I felt Toinette's hand tighten in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine and a moment later she had risen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragging me forward with her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am sorry, madam e, but I can not go</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you," said she. "I must be here to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look after Jean."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madame Alcide received this announce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment with a composure wholly uncompli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentary to Bayou Portage. One could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that, since arriving at the camp, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was prepared for anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must call me Tante Aurore, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">madame, Toinette," she corrected. "As for</seg><seg type="columnLine">your staying here with Jean, it is out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question. It would not be right or</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper, as Pere Parmentier will tell you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Most certainly not," agreed the cure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And why is it not right that Jean ahd I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should keep on as before?" questioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This proved too much for Madame Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cide's powers of endurance. Evidently she</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad remembered that, after all, Toinette</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a Laval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Child, child," she remonstrated. "It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed time that you were with me. Can</seg><seg type="columnLine">you not understand that you are almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown and that, before, your father was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive to protect you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But Jean will protect me just as well,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">persisted Toinette. "He is almost a man."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That is just it," declared Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide, seizing upon this point with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerness that betrayed a close approach</seg><seg type="columnLine">to verbal defeat. "Jean is almost a man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he is of no kin to you. Neither is he</seg><seg type="columnLine">your husband. Under these circumstances</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is impossible for you two to go on living</seg><seg type="columnLine">together."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then if that is the case, we will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">married," said Toinette promptly. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are willing, are you not, Jean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, of course," I agreed. "Pere Par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentier can marry us before he leaves."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Alcide sighed patiently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can not be married, you two," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained.

"Later you will understand. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are wasting time. You will go home</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me, and there is an end of the matter."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before replying, Toinette glanced ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pealingly at Le Bossu. The little man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was sad, but his nod was unmistakable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bien," gave in Toinette. "I will go</seg><seg type="columnLine">then. But Jean must go with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you wish," temporized Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide.

"I</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised Papa Ton. I will work hard, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will live in the woods, if there is no place</seg><seg type="columnLine">at your home.

"You have room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he will prove of help to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And you, Poussard?" continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Alcide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pere Parmentier is right," answered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor. "As for work, I will, if. necessary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">find him a place in my manufactory."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That is settled then," decided Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide. "I will take, him and will do the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best that I can for him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abashed yet grateful, I started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mumble my thanks, but Madame Alcide</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved them aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Off with you and get ready," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered. "Also take Toinette. If, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you return, our business is finished, we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave at once. We can not afford to lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tide."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus I missed the rest of the council,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although the disposal of Papa Ton's few</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects was fully explained to me later on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The traps and the household goods were</seg><seg type="columnLine">left with the Lasalles, who sold them to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new occupants of the hut. The skins, taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the buyers by Le Bossu, were disposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of in the usual way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also the little man arranged for the sale</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Toinette, turning her over to a fish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erman upon the lower coast. The money</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained from these various sources was</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent wholly upon Toinette's education.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He would never study, Oton," declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Alcide. "Therefore he must do</seg><seg type="columnLine">double duty by his daughter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of my last visit to the hut I retain only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a memory of unfamiliarity. Dark, cold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously disordered by the many who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come and gone, the well-remembered room</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like the abode of a stranger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somehow, as I looked about, I felt no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorrow at the thought of my departure. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a shell, that hut, empty even of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories. With the death of Papa Ton</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soul had gone out of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gathering together such garments as</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be worthy of my new estate, I thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the bundle my mother's picture, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gold-piece given me by Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therese. The picture, my one link with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the past, I had kept in a sheltered spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Often I had turned to it in moments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">misfortune to find the vague comfort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that first night upon the prairie. Toinette</seg><seg type="columnLine">too never tired of gazing at the sweet, wist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful face, although she always turned away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it with a light of reflected sadness in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for the gold-piece, despite our many</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessities Toinette had never allowed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to part with this memento of the rue Bour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Jean," she had always replied when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I pleaded the call of our empty larder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Remember, it was the last gift of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear madame."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus I left Bayou Portage as rich as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had arrived; nay, richer, for at the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, when Toinette had come from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">little room, bundle in hand, I had a final</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The gun," I asked. "You think that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might take it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," answered Toinette. "Were</seg><seg type="columnLine">you not partners, you and Papa Ton?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I took down and shouldered the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">muzzle-loader together with its bags of</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder and shot.' Also Toinette fondly</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered her red-shaded lamp, finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving it to a prominent place upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelf above the open fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Evidently, although she had decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandon this cherished possession of hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pier days, she did not mean to have its</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance underestimated by the new oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupants of the hut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then we passed out, and as I shut the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, Toinette put into words my feelings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the past few moments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is not so hard to leave," she mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered half to herself. "It is no longer home.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is only a box of boards."</seg><seg type="columnLine">NEV1L G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HENSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was it and, now that I knew, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood the wisdom of our going.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Alcide was right.

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have been no Bayou Portage for us</seg><seg type="columnLine">without Papa Ton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reaching Tante Odile's, we found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">council over and its participants engaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in considering a miraculously discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">pot of coffee. At sight of us Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide at once set down her cup.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are prompt, you two," she de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared. "Also yours is a good example to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow. Come Pere Parmentier. Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poussard. Remember the tide."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this came a bustle of leave-taking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">during which I was kissed by Tante Odile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smacked upon the back by Father Lasalle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mauled by their swarming brood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, at the landing there was a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">outburst of farewells, in which I said good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">by to every one over again, this time re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiving a silent hand-grip from the partners</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a long and incoherent blessing from old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valsan, before Le Bossu called me aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little man's eyes were suspiciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright, and he spoke with a catch in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, for he had just taken leave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Adieu, Jean," he began. "Adieu and</seg><seg type="columnLine">good luck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But Bossu," I exclaimed, alarmed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his choice of words. "You speak as if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am not to see you again. Will you not</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to the woods?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," he replied. "But Bois</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berard is not Bayou Portage. It is out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my way, as it is out of the way of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">other friends of yours. You will not see</seg><seg type="columnLine">us often."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I will come back," I cried. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will come back as soon as I can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little man shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Jean," said he. "You will not come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, nor will you wish to. You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">through with the marsh. You have all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it can give you. It is time to move on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that is another thing. Here the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paths of our lives will separate, going dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent ways. For me it is the same old</seg><seg type="columnLine">round of skins and game. For you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused, while his arms went around</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in a final embrace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bui we will see," he finished. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now you must go, since the others are wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I left him and went down to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">launch where Toinette, her good-bys over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat staring with unseeing eyes at the wav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, calling group upon the bayou-bank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even when we slipped out from the landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and headed up-stream, she maintained her</seg><seg type="columnLine">air of mute detachment, although I noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the hands that held her bundle were</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolutely clenched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only when we rounded the mud-flat did</seg><seg type="columnLine">she betray any interest in our departure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, as the inhabitants and the few re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maining visitors raised a final cheer, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved with the rest of us, until a bend of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marsh hid the camp from view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, we are off," observed Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poussard, as if in earnest of his readiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take part in any conversation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Madame Alcide was deep in thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you see," she replied, after which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she»resumed her meditation, glancing re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peatedly from Toinette to myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for Pere Parmentier, he had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun to doze with his hat pulled over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, so the little doctor, his duty' done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunched himself into a crumpled, brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball and was immediately fast asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus we journeyed in silence, yet for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me the short voyage was replete with in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest and incident. Throughout my stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Bayou Portage I had not been up as</seg><seg type="columnLine">high as the bridge and, once the more fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliar reaches of the bayou were passed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each bend of the tw'isting stream held some</seg><seg type="columnLine">new vision for my well-trained eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now it was a ribbon of muddy beach,</seg><seg type="columnLine">starred with tracks and littered with clean-,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraped mussel-shells--a very El Dorado</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 'coonskins. Now it was a tiny cove from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which whirred frantically a flock of un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspecting teal. Now it was a school of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumping mullet that glittered for an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the brown water, as if Nature in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">prodigality had thrown aloft a handful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the banks came the quaint chatter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the little brown sparrows, and the red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings. those wantons of the marsh, flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves into the air again and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">through very joy of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, as we approached the bridge, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a fresh interest in the change that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came over the marsh. Below, the grass had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown as thick and even as a well-trimmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">hedge. There had been no break, no rag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gedness to mar the vast sweep of tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">blades that marched on to meet the horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the banks became rough with scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tered hummocks and brush-clumps until,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we swung into the last reach below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge, the grass thinned out entirely, giv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing place to the dense, riotous growth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">'the conquering myrtle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mallows thrust their stiff spikes above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feathery myrtle-tops. Through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaps in the brush I glimpsed a smudge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant live oaks. And then, as we slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">past a clearing made by fishermen, the low</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills of Marsh Island heaved themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">into view. v</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By now the sun had all but dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the marsh rim, and when we finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised the weatherbeaten pile of the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">warehouse and swung into its landing, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky was touched with the grayish rose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brief afterglow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At once Madame Alcide abandoned her</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts and, having paid the owner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch, resumed charge of the expedition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '"Poussard, you will fetch Achille," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered, as we scrambled ashore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You, Toinette and Jean, will wait here</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me until all is ready. As for you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pere Parmentier, there is a place for you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you will have it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Pere Parmentier, although spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">of as the cure, of Bois Berard, was in reality</seg><seg type="columnLine">a resident of the prairie. His small church</seg><seg type="columnLine">and still smaller presbylkre lay some dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance from the woods upon the road to St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pierre, and he had accordingly ridden in</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, meeting the others at the bridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having thanked Madame Alcide for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer, he followed Doctor Poussard around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner of the warehouse. Shortly after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two reappeared, the cure astride a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, wicked-looking pony, the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading an ancient and enormous white</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse that was hitched to a battered surry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At sight of this equipage Madame Alcide</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw fit to perform a species of equine in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">troduction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My horse, Achille," she announced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He is a prince of horses, although like his</seg><seg type="columnLine">namesake he is somewhat uncertain about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heels. You know the story?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I replied that I did not. Toinette merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I will tell it to you at the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity," continued Madame Alcide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Without it you can not appreciate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast at his true worth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She broke off to give the horse a friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">pat upon the shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is all right, Poussard?" she de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor bowed, accompanying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement with a grimace of pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As right as he is heavy, madame," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered ruefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you have been careless, Pous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sard," chided Madame Alcide. "It is quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident that he has stepped upon your foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">again."	-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having been assured of Achilles' condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, Madame Alcide allowed herself to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">assisted to the driver's seat. Then, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limping doctor climbed up beside her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she ordered Toinette and me to get in at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All being ready, she picked up the reins</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, having drawn them into two horizon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal lines, suddenly brought them down with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a resounding slap upon Achille's back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The action was so abrupt, so vigorous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I clutched instinctively for support.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As at the crack of a starter's pistol, 1 ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected that we would dash off at top speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Achille, however, was more accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this demonstration. Save for a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">twitching of the flanks, he paid no heed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this signal, nor did several others, deliv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered in rapid succession, accomplish any</seg><seg type="columnLine">better result.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madame Alcide sighed, as she reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the switch of peeled oak that did duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a whip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is your own fault, Achille," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out, cutting under at some vulner-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able spot that caused the old horse to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rouse himself into a slow, elephantine</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement that might be best described as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stumbling walk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus we rolled pondrously off, crossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridge and causeway, while Pere Par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentier followed beside us, his every energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent to the restraining of his impatient</seg><seg type="columnLine">pony. At the edge of the prairie he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the struggle. Bidding us good night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he loosened rein and at once shot away in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction of his home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After this we labored across the silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy prairie until finally there loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead "a high, black bulwark of forest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evidently Achille became seized with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">longing for the comforts of his stable, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he now quickened his pace to such good</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose that the dark barrier of trees was</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked out with a scatter of lights--very</seg><seg type="columnLine">small and fitful, like the glow of fireflies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, as we went on, and the soft swish</seg><seg type="columnLine">NEVIL G.

Now, as Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide descended earthward with a word</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us to follow, Toinette rose stiffly, drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping her bundle at my feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Jean, Jean," she suddenly cried, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the words she fairly threw herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">into my arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment I had her back upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat again, hugging her close to my breast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And there she lay, a limp, stricken bundle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of despair, torn by the fierceness of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">long pent-up grief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That is right," soothed Madame Alcide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaning inside to comfort her with a caress.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When you have had it. out, you will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">better."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And she added in an undertone:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You must stay with her, Jean, until it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is over.

It was a small place, even for a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">settlement, yet the scatter of rough build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings was so widely spaced that it conveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impression of being twice as populous</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it really was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Coming in from the prairie along a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grassy, woodland road, one first encoun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the store of N.

The store-building was wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deep, with a high, slanting roof, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spacious front porch. Upon its right, set</seg><seg type="columnLine">back behind a fence of fancy wire, was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storekeeper's home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This home was the wonder of the prairie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for its owner had modeled it in miniature</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a dwelling in St. Pierre. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">square house of a story and a half, severe</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its lines to the tops of the upper win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows. Here began an elaborate contortion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of scrollwork pendant from the eaves, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at one side bulged forth a bay-window with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a round, peaked roof that resembled a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">dunce-cap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next to his business, which was founded</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon long years of square dealing, Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sieur Bonnemaison was proudest of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">home.

"Even though I am in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods, I must live up to my name."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond the store straggled a line of small</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabins. In them dwelt the inhabitants of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bois Berard, wood-folk who followed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">special calling, tending their small gardens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting or gathering moss in the forest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning their hands to such odd bits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">work as came along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were a cheery lot, indolent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">care-free, keenly alive to all forms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusement. Seldom was there a ball, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse-race, or a cock-fight upon the prairie</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could not boast of at least one rep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resentative from Bois Berard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following the cabins came the home of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Alcide, a modest structure in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parison with that of Monsieur Bonnemai-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, yet one far better suited to its en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vironment.

As</seg><seg type="columnLine">a house it had no definite design, nor in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed had such a thing been considered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its leisurely, haphazard construction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the days of Madame Alcide's pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perity her husband had often found it</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to visit this portion of his hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. Accordingly he had built a rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter to serve him when overtaken by</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Finding good hunting at this par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular spot, he had added to the original</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut that his friends might join him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sport.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, when this edge of the forest had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been given his name, he had shown his ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preciation by adding still more, often com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the woods for weeks at a time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valued by Alcide Berard solely through</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasons of sentiment, this forest retreat had</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved to be a most welcome refuge to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">widow upon his death and the melting away</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his estate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the house stretched a broad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ragged lawn, shaded by two huge live-oaks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a sprinkling of smaller trees. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back was a huddle of outbuildings, to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether with the prim, green rows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame. Alcide's kitchen garden. Inside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house was merely a succession of rooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">that opened upon the broad galleries flank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the front and rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reaching away from the farther limits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yard was a pasture, its outer edge in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dented by a sagging line of barbed-wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence. Inside the enclosure thus made</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood a two-roomed outhouse, to which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been added a small lean-to. This outhouse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though dilapidated and sadly in need of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whitewash, had about it an air of immacu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late cleanliness, and to one of its pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors was nailed a neatly printed sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">which read:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> CHARLES ARISTIDE POUSSARD.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DOCTEUR EN MEDECINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon the door of the lean-to was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second sign, its letters larger and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">straggly as became its humbler announce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. This time was proclaimed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> C. A. POUSSARD.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">MANUFACTURE OF MATTRESSES.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As for the doctor himself, he was the sole</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery amid the frank, simple life of Bois</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berard. Years before he had drifted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">from somewhere out in the world, small,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">3*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brown, dingy, exactly as he had remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever since.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of his history nothing was known save</seg><seg type="columnLine">a word dropped here and there at the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his arrival. In France he had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">surgeon in the army. Then there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">some trouble, and he had resigned and come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to America.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was all, but at Bois Berard it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">well understood that, in the trouble, Doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor Poussard had not been at fault. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shielded some one, a relative or friend.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or perhaps the culprit had been married,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wmie the doctor was a bachelor with no</seg><seg type="columnLine">family to disgrace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was the legend woven by the wood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">folk around Doctor Poussard's few words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I, for one, accepted it without question.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So gravely courteous, so utterly honest was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little doctor that one could not con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceive of his having ever committed a wrong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the rest, the doctor eked out an</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence that was made possible solely</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the charity of his friends. Trust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him absolutely as a companion, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">distrusted him wholly as a physician, send-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing outside for medical advice in all ill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesses of a serious nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only for slight hurts and simple ail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments did they call him in, paying him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">money or supplies according to their pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perity. Also they occasionally bought one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his mattresses--shapeless, lumpy affairs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the manufacture of which he seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">never to improve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poussard's is a hard case," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood-folk. "It is a miracle that he gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chiefly responsible for this miracle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Alcide. From the very first she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken the little doctor under her pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tection. Always she was having him in to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meals, to Sunday dinners, to week-day</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppers, to little feasts born of the arrival</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some rare or unexpected delicacy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also she assisted him financially, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulting him about an invented disorder</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she termed vaguely, "my migraine,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">buying his mattresses and presenting them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in secret to the poor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But of far more value than these ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terial benefits was Madame Alcide's atti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude toward the little doctor--the attitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">which brought into his barren, pitiful life</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sense of worth and usefulness. Let any</seg><seg type="columnLine">question of importance arise, and Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide's first act was to send for the doc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROMANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">32	NEVJL' G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tor. Next, having stated her case in full,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she would request his advice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then would follow a period of silent re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flection, after which the doctor would cry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face aglow with timid pride:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, madame, there is nothing that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can say. It is exactly as you yourself have</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. I have considered it from all sides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yours is the only way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Madame Alcide, exhibiting a truly</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable surprize, would exclaam:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But Poussard, you delight me. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I am a woman, it would seem that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am not wholly bereft of sense."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At other times she treated him with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">utmost bruskness, but this, she told me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was done through stern necessity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see, like most unfortunates, Pous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sard is very sensitive," she explained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Once let him receive the impression of</seg><seg type="columnLine">patronage or of charity, and he would dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear immediately. Then too he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have faith in himself, and this can be ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complished in no other way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To defer to him entirely would either</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause him to become suspicious or over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of himself. To rebuff him continually</seg><seg type="columnLine">would crush him and drive him away. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">pat here, a slap there is the way to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">him going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And she added defensively:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But do not undervalue Poussard. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you that he is one in a thousand. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">is never in the way, yet when you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he is always there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And for all this the little doctor repaid</seg><seg type="columnLine">his benefactress with a devotion which ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached close to worship. Always he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her command, appearing instantly upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her slightest need for him. Always he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to advise her, to look after Achille,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accompany her upon those occasions</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she traveled abroad in state. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">always he contrived an unobtrusiveness, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-effacement that made him a very prince</seg><seg type="columnLine">of attendants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beyond the doctor's cabin the settlement</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended in a second row of cabins, the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which posed fitfully as a store. Here a</seg><seg type="columnLine">succession of ever failing proprietors sold</seg><seg type="columnLine">tobacco, fruit, prize-packages of cheap</seg><seg type="columnLine">candy, and the sticky red soda-pop that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was known as "Rouge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was significant that Monsieur Bonne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maison's emporium was called the store,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while this second, smaller place had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed designation.

I tended the garden. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">chopped wood and hauled it in from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">near-by forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also I spent many hours with rod and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, so that the table seldom lacked its</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply of fish and game. After the toil</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the marsh it was like a holiday, and al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways my love of the soil increased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I now found my chief delight in Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide's garden, and only when some in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound traveler passed with his purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarding of seed-cane, did I lose my con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentment. Then I thought of those vast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustling acres beyond the prairie, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I returned to my kitchen stuff with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mingled sense of longing and contempt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for Toinette, she at last found her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in one of those long-envied homes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mainland. At first there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">some talk of the convent, but even then</seg><seg type="columnLine">its Winter session was far advanced. Ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cordingly Toinette joined Madame Alcide</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the care of the house. As yet she lacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">her bright humor, her quaint fancy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">former days, nor did she soon regain them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In their place came a quiet wistfulness to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark the memory of her loss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus the weeks slipped by until, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the approach of Summer, I suddenly found</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself at a standstill.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">care of Achille, formerly a dangerous ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture, had now developed into a tiresome</seg><seg type="columnLine">routine.

"It is agreed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You do your part, and you may count upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to do mine. But first of all you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">find work. You have decided what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can trap, I can hunt," I began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old lady made a gesture of dissent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are through with all that," she in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrupted.

But what can I do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this Madame Alcide smiled in benevo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent appreciation.

He is a sharp one, that Bonnemaison,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or at least he thinks he is, which is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same thing. You see, he has run for so</seg><seg type="columnLine">long in a rut that the mere mention of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">change would have thrown him into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic.

Only, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one must go about the matter with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">utmost delicacy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is like trapping," supplemented</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette. "To be sure of a right catch, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">must use the right bait and must hide it</seg><seg type="columnLine">well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madame Alcide nodded sagely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly," she agreed. "The bait is</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But see that you do not disturb my</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap, Jean," she went on, speaking directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. "As yet it is only half-sprung.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Bonnemaison has not accepted you as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerk. He means only to give you a trial.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If you do well and he is satisfied, he will</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep you on. Then people will speak of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the clerk until it comes to Bonnemaison's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At first he will be indignant.

Here I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">received by Monsieur Bonnemaison whom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the magic of having become my</seg><seg type="columnLine">employer, I viewed with far different eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">than those of the months before. For,</seg><seg type="columnLine">judging him solely by his personal appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, I had always considered the store-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper with a species of mild contempt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a small, stout man, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stoutness was of such a round, puffy sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he resembled nothing so much as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge animated ball. Indeed, in moments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement Monsieur Bonnemaison seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly to bounce along, although at ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">times he proceeded by means of a sedate</seg><seg type="columnLine">waddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His head like his body was smooth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, beginning with a perfectly bald</seg><seg type="columnLine">crown and ending in a fat pink chin, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of a baby. Between crown and chin</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared a small pair of pensive blue eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a button-like nose and a mouth that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever set in an amiable smile. Whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mood, Monsieur Bonnemaison never</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost that smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through long practise it had become as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much a part of him as the lips that ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed it. His eyes might betray impa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tience, anger, even despair, but one had</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to glance below them to be reassured</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his amiability. Thus, to the country at</seg><seg type="columnLine">large the storekeeper was ever more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a puzzle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is a queer one, that Bonnemaison,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the wood-folk. "You never know</seg><seg type="columnLine">which part of his face to believe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Summed up in a word, Monsieur Bonne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maison was bland but, as I came to learn,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROMANCE	I</seg><seg type="columnLine">j6	NEVIL G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his blandness was of a sort peculiar to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. Outwardly he might appear a mild,</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemplative cherub. Inwardly he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as inscrutable as a Chinese god.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Jean," he greeted me. "And so</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have come to help? Bicn, you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin by taking down the shutters'. In no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other way could you be of more assistance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one of my age."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This accomplished, he led the way in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors, where for a busy ten minutes he</seg><seg type="columnLine">waddled up and down the two long counters</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lined the store upon either side, point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out the different articles and firing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">prices at me with the rapidity and precision</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a machine-gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, m'sieu," I protested, when finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">his breath gave out.

Here he sat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling and staring out over the road, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I watched him from the doorway in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever increasing agony of helplessness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what must I do now, m'sieu?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally burst out, when I could stand it n»</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again Monsieur Bonnemaison's eyes ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed a species of quiet astonishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, wait upon the customers, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course," he replied and returned to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling and staring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Utterly demoralized, I stumbled back in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, where I wandered aimlessly from one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HENSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">counter to another. All along I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought Monsieur Bonnemaison peculiar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now it appeared that he was undeniably</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad. And here I was expected to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the madman's customers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having never made a sale in my life, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was further handicapped by my complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorance of the prices and disposition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stock in trade. I could only wait in</seg><seg type="columnLine">impotent despair for the customers to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When, however, the customers made</seg><seg type="columnLine">their appearance, my difficulties vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a wholly unexpected manner. At that</seg><seg type="columnLine">early hour the demand was solely for sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plies, for flour and sugar and coffee, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">modities of which I knew the prices by</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. To my delight I found that, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">unearthed the stock of groceries, I had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to weigh out, to wrap up, to hand over my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill-bound packages and receive the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">in exchange for them. As for salesmanship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I discovered that it played no part in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposal of these simple necessities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Jean," Monsieur Bonnemaison ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served afterward. "If your supplies are</seg><seg type="columnLine">good, they will sell therriselves.

But even here my fears were</seg><seg type="columnLine">groundless, for when in due course this</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreaded eventuality arrived, the problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">was solved by Monsieur Bonnemaison him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self.

Rather he seemed always to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know them beforehand, rising promptly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">this one came into view, allowing that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pass inside with only a nod and a word</seg><seg type="columnLine">of greeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When at noon I hurried off to my dinner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had decided that my employer was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite so mad as I had thought him to be.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indeed, I could now find a certain method</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his procedure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this I confided to Madame Alcide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">who followed my recital with an air of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      - ROMANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">amused yet sympathetic understanding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evidently she had been prepared for these</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiarities upon the part of my employer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is all right, Jean," said she. "Stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">it out and you will see.

Often 1 made mistakes, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained a knowledge of the stock of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt that I had some right to be proud.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Having put up the shutters, I lingered</seg><seg type="columnLine">about in hopes that my employer would</seg><seg type="columnLine">comment on my progress. But Monsieur</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bonnemaison appeared thoroughly unap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preciative.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the closing of the store he retired</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the small railed-off space in the rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">which did duty as an office.

I worked hard, learning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stock, and mastering quite a respectable</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of prices. Yet for all my pains I</seg><seg type="columnLine">received not so much as a single word of</seg><seg type="columnLine">commendation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> True, upon all other subjects my em- ..</seg><seg type="columnLine">ployer was affability itself.

Yet once let me lead up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question of my progress, and he would at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once discover some matter that demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">his immediate attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the end I became thoroughly exas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perated. Through my life on the marsh I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become used to a system of frank criti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cism or approval.

"And is it not enough?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, yes, m'sieu," I answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Only-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I broke off, while his smile expanded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chuckle of amusement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only you would like a little word of</seg><seg type="columnLine">praise, eh?" he finished for me.

Now you</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that I was right. So continue your</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience, Jean, and trust me to know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">is best.

This, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, was the storekeeper's way. Always</seg><seg type="columnLine">he obscured with outward pettiness the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner shrewdness that had won his success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONVENT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW that I had found regular employ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, the time passed quickly enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Bois Berard. Almost before I realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, the Summer was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One month we were in the midst of hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather--fierce, blazing weather--in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wood-folk drowsed away the long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright hours beneath the leafy canopy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest; in which the very birds sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover during the midday glare; in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">travelers, inbound, gulped the shade in</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, thankful gasps, their eyes all strained</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blood-shot from the gauzy, dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat-waves of the prairie. The next, Fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">had arrived--the brief, busy Fall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mainland.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, as upon the marsh, there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all sides a vast and incessant stir of</seg><seg type="columnLine">endeavor. In the woods the furred crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures scurried furtively about, strengthen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their defenses of food and lair against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the onslaught of Winter. Above them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds flitted unceasingly, shrilling their in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignation against the first of the invading</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoards of wax-wings and robins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the settlement the wood-folk bestirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves as from a long sleep, sharpening</seg><seg type="columnLine">their axes, reaching down their moss-hooks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipping away upon the various ventures</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would see them through cold weather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And beyond, in the wide, fertile stretch</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rimmed the prairie, the very loafers</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose unbidden to face three months of</seg><seg type="columnLine">feverish labor. For the cane was ripe, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mills stood ready and throughout the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">had rung the magic call to grinding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the store we were busy enough our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves in outfitting this new-born industry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Often we worked late in the uncertain light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the swinging lamps, so that I would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn home utterly weary through the end-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less handing out of goods and supplies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, one night when I sat down to a be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lated supper, there came an event which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had all but forgotten in the rush of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">season.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will need a day off next week,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Madame Alcide in the brusk tone with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she always heralded an unpleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">announcement. "You had best warn Bon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nemaison in the morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why, madame?" I questioned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled by the request at such a time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madame Alcide answered with a name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Toinette," said she shortly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is the convent, Jean," explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette herself. "It opens on Tuesday. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course you will wish to drive us in, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the last of me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Of course," I replied, and after that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper went untasted. •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toinette going away! Now that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">viewed it squarely, the idea seemed pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posterous. Why, I had come to the woods</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the sole purpose of being with Toinette.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And here she was going on Tuesday, to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone at best until the following Summer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course I had known that she was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go, but it had all been vague; something</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had thought of as existing in the far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant future. And now it had occurred,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly, almost unexpectedly, like some sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den disaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Toinette!" I cried aghast. "You must</seg><seg type="columnLine">not go. I can not get on without you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, yes but you can," she teased. "In</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than a week you will have forgotten me</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, realizing the genuineness of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismay, she changed at once, hurrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the table to comfort me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, Jean," she soothed. "It will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right. At the camp, perhaps, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been hard. Here you will find it very</seg><seg type="columnLine">different."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterward I thought often of Toinette's</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, for through them she caused me for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time to consider the change in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">relationship. Now I realized that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not with us as it had been upon the marsh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There the tie had been absolute. We had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been partners, sharing each deed, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, each word in our struggle against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wild. Between us there had been no</seg><seg type="columnLine">special distinction. Our tasks had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">performed by one or the other according</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the necessity of the moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At Bois Berard all this had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed from the first day of our arrival.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With Madame Alcide marriage was the one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">d - -	ROMANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">possible partnership between the sexes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus Toinette and I now shared only our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours of leisure, hours which, through my</seg><seg type="columnLine">work at the store, had come to mean meal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times and the brief space between supper</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That this was as it should be I fully ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preciated, yet whenever I considered my</seg><seg type="columnLine">present attitude toward Toinette, it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow to savor of neglect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly I did my best to make it up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her in the time before her departure, pay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her countless small attentions, bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">her the choice of Monsieur Bonnemaison's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock of trinkets and fancy articles of dress.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All this Toinette accepted with a delight</seg><seg type="columnLine">which caused me to redouble my efforts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it is too much, Jean," she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">protest. "I shall be so spoiled that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">good sisters will refuse to take me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madame Alcide, vastly occupied in pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paring Toinette's simple wardrobe, viewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">my efforts with an air of amused under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was really funny, Jean," she said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me long afterward. "No, you were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupid. That is the way with you men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is only when you wholly misunderstand</seg><seg type="columnLine">such things that you imagine you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything about them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the matter of the day off I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monsieur Bonnemaison all complaisance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course I must go. Also I must use his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse, an animal renowned for its gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But here Madame Alcide interposed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">objection. It was a family affair, she de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared, and it must be carried out in proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion. She would as soon think of leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Poussard behind as to refuse the ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vices of her faithful Achille.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly early Tuesday morning, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four of us set out behind the old horse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plodded interminably across the prairie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until late in the forenoon we arrived at St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pierre. Here we drove at once to the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent, a tall, square, many-pillared build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, set snugly amid a grove of live oaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the far bank of the bayou that bor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered the town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And here we left Toinette with the sisters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mount Carmel, who at once shut her in</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the barrier of their spreading, stiffly</seg><seg type="columnLine">starched head-dresses, as if in immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence of their determination to shield</seg><seg type="columnLine">her henceforth from the profanations of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">- ROM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The parting was brief, so brief in fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the part of Madame Alcide and my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self as to suggest a grave doubt of self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-by, Toinette," I gulped, my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chaos of the things that I had planned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say upon the drive, and had until then</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly forgotten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be patient," muttered Madame Alcide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she stooped for her farewell kiss. "It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Adieu, mademoiselle," said Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poussard with his best military bow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Toinette, smiling bravely despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">her brimming eyes, could only keep re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peating, "Good-by, Jean; good-by, Tante</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aurore; good-by, M'sieu le Docleur," until'</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had passed out of the dim formality of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the convent parlor and the heavy front</seg><seg type="columnLine">door had swung to behind us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterward we crossed back to the town</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, having made Achille comfortable at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a livery-stable, Madame Alcide departed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a shopping-expedition, leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor and I to wander miserably about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets, until such time as our ancient steed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fit to travel again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We returned almost in silence and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered a house that for me was sadly remin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iscent of my last visit to the hut at Bayou</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portage. Toinette had spoken truly then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I told myself. For a time, at least, Mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ame Alcide's comfortable home would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more to me than a box of boards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If I brooded upon this during supper, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not long allowed the luxury of my self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pity. Once the meal was over and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dishes cleared away, Madame Alcide pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced from among her various purchases</seg><seg type="columnLine">a square, heavy package done up in thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper.

They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fat, scholarly books, very sober and busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness-like, and they seemed perfectly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">express Madame Alcide's attitude as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread them out before me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For you," she explained. "Or rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us, since you are to read from them</seg><seg type="columnLine">each night after supper."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, madame," said I, thinking that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood. "Then it will not be so hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us about Toinette."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old lady's look became grim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">40</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEVIL G.

I would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to have Toinette come back and find</seg><seg type="columnLine">her old aunt behind her in every way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So spoke Madame Alcide and, be it said</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my credit, that I was able at once to</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand. For of the books one dealt</seg><seg type="columnLine">with agriculture in general and another</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the growing of cane in particular, sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects as far removed from the curriculum of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the good sisters as they were from the ne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessities of Madame Alcide herself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And with understanding came apprecia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, not only of all that Madame Alcide</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant to do for me, but of the exquisite</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact and kindliness with which she had set</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth her plans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Madame," I muttered at a loss for</seg><seg type="columnLine">words. "You are too good to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The old lady nodded approvingly. As a</seg><seg type="columnLine">virtue, quickness of perception ranked high</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her esteem.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Bwn, Jean. That is all right," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">she. "Did you not begin by teaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette? The score is far from being</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled, I assure you. Tomorrow we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">start."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After this I read aloud each night, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Alcide sewed and listened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot me brief comments during the pauses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first it was hard after the long round at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the store, but later, as my interest in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased, it became for me the most pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour of the day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Also I learned, picking up many bits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">agriculture, of history, of mythology, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them spiced with the brisk yet mellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of Madame Alcide's long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy life. She had wisdom as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge, had Madame Alcide, and many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her comments remain with me, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lessons that inspired them have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">long forgotten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In particular I remember her words in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pause that followed the death of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">beloved hero, M'sieu L'Empereur Na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poleon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A great man, Jean," she observed. "Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can not help but think that your way is</seg><seg type="columnLine">best. Is it not finer to bring live things</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the ground than to put dead men</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the Winter passed with its work, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">saving, its efforts, upon the part of Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide, to continue my neglected education.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christmas brought disappointment for, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the approach of the feast, Madame Alcide</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced that Toinette would not return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would be a break, and breaks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">disastrous, she declared. Toinette had</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to learn that only the unbroken</seg><seg type="columnLine">round of daily habit could teach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus I spent rather a lonely day, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">began with mass at Pere Parmentier's little</seg><seg type="columnLine">prairie church and ended in my returning</seg><seg type="columnLine">at dusk from a long hunt upon the near-by</seg><seg type="columnLine">marsh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then came the Spring, a wondrous, fairy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Spring, far removed from the drab</seg><seg type="columnLine">rebirth of the marsh--a Spring of myriad</seg><seg type="columnLine">tender leaves, alight and quivering against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind-swept scatter of the sunshine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, even as I marveled at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glory of the woods, Summer arrived, bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Toinette's return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TOINETTE COMES HOME</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAVING learned that Toinette would</seg><seg type="columnLine">finish her term upon a Wednesday</seg><seg type="columnLine">early in June, Madame Alcide departed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monday before. She intended to visit cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain relatives in St. Pierre, and she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">further determined to miss no single detail</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the convent's closing-exercises.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course it will be the usual thing,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said she. "They will recite and pound</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the piano. But that is not the point.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette will play her part, and in playing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will show me what she has accomplished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will know perfectly well how far she has</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone before I am back again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly Madame Alcide departed</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone behind Achille, leaving me to three</seg><seg type="columnLine">days of desolation in her empty house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">True, I did not lack entirely for company,</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN T,R OUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as Doctor Poussard came over for a brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit each night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whether this was due to the request of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Alcide or to the promptings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own kindly nature I do not know, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the first the little doctor gave evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence that he would prove anything but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerful companion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Usually silent, his reticence was of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort that needed but a friendly word to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring forth the true quality of his amiabil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity. Just now, however, he preserved a</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled muteness that was touched with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint hint of injury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To one less observant than myself the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of this would have been plain, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he denied himself the comfort of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional fragment of speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A convent now, Jean," he observed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first night. "Naturally it is no place for</seg><seg type="columnLine">men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later he muttered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just the same 'St. Pierre' is not all con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent. It is also a town, as every one knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in leaving, he said wholly to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, his eyes turned toward the empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">stable--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I could at least have looked after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Achille."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poor Doctor Poussard! He understood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, but he could not reconcile himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the situation. The convent might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly a feminine affair, yet it established</seg><seg type="columnLine">a most unwelcome precedent. It was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy for him to look into the future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus it was with a very dejected doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I set out along the wood-road upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon of Toinette's return. Knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ways of Achille, I had delayed our de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parture until sunset. Yet even then we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited long, and twilight had set in before</seg><seg type="columnLine">we caught the surrey's dark bulk against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dim, misty reach of the prairie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are there, Jean?" called Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide as we hurried forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At your service, madame," cried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor, before I could even attempt an</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poussard, I have missed you," came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back the reply. "Next time, convent or no</seg><seg type="columnLine">convent, you will go along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the dusk I could see the relief</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the little doctor's face. Then I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">abreast of the surrey, and a slender, vibrant</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure had sprung down into my waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jean, Jean," cried Toinette, clutching</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in a way that brought back the bear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hug of Papa Ton. "It is so good to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, to be home again. It did not seem so</seg><seg type="columnLine">long while I was away, but now I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was a hundred years."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If in the days of waiting I had harbored</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertain, half-formed doubts as to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting, they were set at rest by thfe first</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of Toinette's reaching hands. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been no change, I told myself. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the same Toinette of the year before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, as we went along in the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surrey, I decided that there had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">change--a change for the better. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager, chattering Toinette was not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette of Bois Berard. Rather she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the old Toinette of the marsh, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright, elusive Toinette who had vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">that cruel night at Bayou Portage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If I slammed Monsieur Bonnpmaison's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shutters in closing up a while later, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only through the sheer exultation of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts. If, after the last bolt was shot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I raced all the way to Madame Alcide's, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only because I lacked a swifter means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of progress. And then, when I had thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the door and come into the lamplight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found still another Toinette--a Toinette</seg><seg type="columnLine">of whom I could guess little save that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was different.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That she was taller, that her dress had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been lengthened, that she had done some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to her hair which caused her to ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear no longer a small girl, I saw at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance. All this had been denied me by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusk, yet, in a way, I had expected it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was some inner, deeper change, sensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than seen, that checked my rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits with a touch of slow bewilderment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dimly I realized that the vivid creature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a while before had been born solely of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement of our meeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, when Toinette had left the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon some errand, Madame Alcide ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained it all in a few crisp sentences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see, Jean?" said she. "She is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure yet. She is finding her way. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen the exercises, and I know that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is all right. Next year it will be different."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was it, I told myself, and from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment I ceased my puzzling. For, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, Toinette was Toinette, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for any one. Besides, if she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not sure of herself, how could I possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope to understand her?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, Jean!" she would cry, when speak-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROMANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">41	NEV1L G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the convent. "There is so much to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do, so much to learn. Sometimes I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had best been left with the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild creatures of the marsh. But it is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I am unwilling to do my part. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would like to learn it all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In proof of this she insisted upon a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuance of the nightly reading which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had determined to abandon during hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather. She must have her share of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own particular learning, she declared. Also</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be like old times to have me teach</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. As a consequence I kept on with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">books, while Madame Alcide, frankly sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rendering to the heat of the lamp, dozed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the gallery, in the fond belief that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was listening through the opened window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, the reading over, we would slip</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the old lady to stroll about in the cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the starlight, talking of the days at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bayou Portage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet, for all the gossip about the store, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could give Toinette little news of the camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Le Bossu had spoken truly in his farewell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thus far I had seen nothing of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends upon the marsh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> True, Toinette and I had planned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit them, but this proved impossible. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">Summer the camp was abandoned. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool weather came the convent, my busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">season at the store.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of Le Bossu himself I had heard from</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to time, since the little man was well</seg><seg type="columnLine">known upon the mainland. Through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past season he had trapped and hunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the Vermilion. Now he was upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bay, from where he had sent a message</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we would see him before he went back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his traps again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so, upon a long-remembered morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in mid-Summer, the little man made</seg><seg type="columnLine">good his promise, coming to the woods for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whole day. It was a Sunday, chosen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of my duties, and from noon until</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunset Toinette and I plied our visitor with</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions about the marsh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had seen them all, had Le Bossu.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had even put in at the camp, deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">now by all save old Pierre. The Lasalles</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on the mainland. Young Pierre was</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy with the fishing. The partners, me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thodical as usual, were established for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Summer at Anse Le Vert. All had sent us</seg><seg type="columnLine">words of greeting. All had rejoiced at our</seg><seg type="columnLine">good fortune.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are proud of you two," declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">Le Bossu. " 'What, Jean with Bonne-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HENSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">maison, and Toinette at the convent?' they</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to me. 'That speaks well for Bayou</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portage.' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In return we told the little man of our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves, eager for his never failing sympathy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and understanding. Toinette's fears he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismissed with a snap of his fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will go like that--this uncertainty,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he declared. "It is all right now, my little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette, only you do not know it. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not fear to realize the difficulties of an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dertaking. It is good sense, and with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all things are possible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of my own success he seemed equally as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sured, speaking to me quite frankly of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes, once we were alone together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is what I expected, Jean," said he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The cane is in your blood, and only when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have grown it and seen it go into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mill will you be satisfied.

"We shall see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was only when he was upon his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Toinette and I were bidding him fare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well at the rim of the prairie that Le Bossu</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke of Papa Ton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You thought that I had forgotten him?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he questioned. "Ah no, for he has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us all day. And that was best.

This season I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will again be on the Vermilion, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm weather I have planned to go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the swamps, my old home. Perhaps I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not see you for long, and I would say</seg><seg type="columnLine">a word before I leave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are going up, you two, far, far up</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond any hope Papa Ton may have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you. Thus you may look back to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">some day and see only a rough old man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as careless in ways as in speech. Should you</seg><seg type="columnLine">do this, say to yourselves: 'That is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">Papa Ton. It is Papa Ton as he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, perhaps, but not as he was.' Always</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember this. It is what he was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">counts."</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN T</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our protestations he dismissed with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is all right," said he. "I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how you feel, but you are young, and some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times we are tricked by our thoughts. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest, just think of Papa Ton as being</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the marsh. He is there, I tell you, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much now as before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he bade us good-by and departed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor did I see him again for many a day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His stay in the swamps was a long one and</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his return it was my misfortune to</seg><seg type="columnLine">miss him on his infrequent journeys across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prairie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet the memory of his visit remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, as we returned in the gray and gold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the afterglow, Toinette spoke to me of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple peace that the little man's words</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was good to see Bossu," said she.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It was good to hear him. And best of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">was what he said at parting.

Hardly, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed, had I begun to know Toinette, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore Fall was at hand, and preparations</seg><seg type="columnLine">were going forward for her return to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">convent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would have been a trying time for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">but foj the rush of the season and its con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequent effect upon my employer. We sold</seg><seg type="columnLine">much that year, so much that, considering</seg><seg type="columnLine">his depleted stock, Monsieur Bonnemaison</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived at a wholly unexpected determina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Always before he had ordered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">goods by letter from New Orleans or from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dealers at St. Pierre. Now he decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would branch out a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will go to the city for the new stock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jean," said he quite abrutly one night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are here to look after things, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">change will be good for me. Then I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">get new ideas; I will see what I am buying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">.

Nevertheless I viewed Monsieur</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bonnemaison's departure with an ever in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasing uneasiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the woods the store was an imposing</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair, and its management involved a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncomfortable responsibility. When finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette returned to St. Pierre with Mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ame Alcide and the triumphant Poussard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her going was made easier by the problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lay before me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A week later Monsieur Bonnemaison an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced the morning of his departure, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the days that followed, his going proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">a source of endless discussion and specula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Of course, being both Cajun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">human, Monsieur Bonnemaison had more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than once surrendered to the seductions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the carnival, but in the eyes of Bois Berard</seg><seg type="columnLine">this particular journey was fraught with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange yet very genuine importance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They will be something, those new</seg><seg type="columnLine">goods," said the inhabitants. "We shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a Christmas to remember."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The psychology of this is perhaps best</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained in the words of Monsieur Bonne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maison himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is not the goods but the manner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their purchase," said he, when I asked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. "Take for example a knife, or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered by me from St. Pierre and sold to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hulin, the hunter. If asked where he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, he will reply, 'At Bonnemaison's,' and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter is ended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But let Hulin go himself to St. Pierre</seg><seg type="columnLine">and buy the same knife from the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">store, and you will observe a difference.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now he will stop each acquaintance, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show the knife and hold forth upon its</seg><seg type="columnLine">merits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " 'How is that for a blade?' he will ask.</seg><seg type="columnLine">'No, it is none of Bonnemaison's stuff. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought it myself at St. Pierre.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thus it is the same with these goods</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the city. They can not go, Hulin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest. It is impossible. Therefore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next best thing is to have me go for them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch Hulin when he buys his next</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife. For a week he will carry it about in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " 'Here is a real blade for you,' he will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was in the manner of his final instruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, however, that Monsieur Bonne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maison displayed his true knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">human nature. He did not frighten me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with useless commands. He did not con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuse me with trilling detail?. Only in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of the mail, which was brought in</seg><seg type="columnLine">each day from the prairie, and which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarded with an awe closely bordering</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon reverence, did he warn me to be par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly careful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To me you can explain a mistake, Jean.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To the Government, never," he admon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished. "And the Government is the law.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is the one thing that you must re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the rest he merely told me to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">on as usual, an injunction that increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">my confidence a thousandfold. As a conse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quence, the day of his departure found me</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided between my regret at his leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my desire to show him how well I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Au revoir, Jean," said he, when his</seg><seg type="columnLine">buggy was before the store and, valise in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, he had come out of his tightly closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. "In five days, a week perhaps, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall be back again. Yes, I will remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look for your Madame Therese, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though from what you have said I fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it is hopeless. No, I have nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you. You are in charge now and it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you to say what shall or shall not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This last, spoken loudly, was for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefit of the small crowd that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered to see him off; a chuckling, mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering crowd from which exploded every</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then some witticism concerning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the probable antics of an old man upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">being faced with the perils and temptations</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this Monsieur Bonnemaison took in</seg><seg type="columnLine">good part, shaking hands right and left and</seg><seg type="columnLine">making the most extravagant promises as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to what he would order for each particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. Then, climbing into his buggy, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved his hand and was driven off amid a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting of farewells.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he had vanished beyond the trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I reentered the store with a feeling almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">of satisfaction. That the responsibility was</seg><seg type="columnLine">great I still realized, but, thanks to Mon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sieur Bonnemaison's attitude, I now felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully capable of accepting it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we sold only for cash and I knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock by heart, I had only to open and close</seg><seg type="columnLine">the store and wait upon such customers as</seg><seg type="columnLine">came along. After all, it was very simple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> True, certain shiftless folk, scenting their</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance, approached me with tales of press-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing need and of various employments that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would fill their empty pockets by the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the week. However, I not only knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">them well, but I also understood perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to deal with them. Having tried me</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, they did not trouble me again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In one case only did I make an excep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Of Doctor Poussard's dealing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the establishment I knew nothing, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had always transacted his business with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monsieur Bonnemaison himself. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he came to me for his meager sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plies, telling of a mattress that would cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly be finished and paid for in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, I served him without question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His relief was as pitiful as it was sincere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thank you, Jean," he quavered. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have been nice to have had my</seg><seg type="columnLine">credit impaired. And now, if you wish, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will stay a while, coming back from time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to time. I can do nothing, perhaps, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be here in case of need."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Poor Doctor Poussard! The courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which he had steeled himself against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a possible refusal must have been great</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed. Now, in proof of his gratitude, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered me the one remaining possession</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his company.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus I came to know the little Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, and in knowing him I was impressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">more each day by the marvelous comfort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his society. Never have I known such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion as Doctor Poussard. As Mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ame Alcide declared, he was only there</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you had need of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MONSIEUR DUGAS FIGURES IN ANOTHER</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHRISTMAS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN SIX days Monsieur Bonnemaison was</seg><seg type="columnLine">back again. He arrived quite unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectedly, driving out in a hired buggy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">entering the store with as little ceremony</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he had merely stepped over from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">home. Indeed, I thought him a customer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROMANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">4S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">until his quiet, "Well, here I am, Jean,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought me hurrying forward in welcome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, after he had looked about, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke briefly of his journey. He had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">good luck with his buying. Also he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoyed himself. He had seen many new</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wonderful things, and it was always</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting to watch the crowds. Of Mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ame Therese he had inquired carefully but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to no avail. She was already forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the rue Bourbon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally he could see that I had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, and in expectation of this he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought me a little gift. It was a watch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if I was pleased with it, I might con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sider my thanks as already said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing could have been more typical</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Monsieur Bonnemaison than his attitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon this occasion. Had any other in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitant of Bois Berard returned from such</seg><seg type="columnLine">an outing, the recital of his adventures</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been a matter of mouths.</seg><seg type="columnLine">True, the visit had impressed Monsieur</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bonnemaison, as was evidenced by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner in which he commented upon it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was his habit when interested to smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">and talk glibly upon all subjects save the</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular one that occupied his attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His treatment of the wood-folk was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvel of diplomacy. When they hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, eager for each detail of his journey, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied that he had had a good time and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then plunged into a description of the forth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming -goods that drove all other thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their minds. Thus he satisfied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">public curiosity until, with the arrival of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the goods themselves, the incident was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They caused much excitement, those</seg><seg type="columnLine">goods. Chosen carefully, they lived up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even beyond the reputation established</seg><seg type="columnLine">beforehand by their purchaser. Once they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been hauled out from the railroad, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoyed a trade such as Monsieur Bonne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maison himself had not expected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Women came from the farthest limits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prairie for bonnets, for dress-goods, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the innumerable flashy trinkets with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we added life and color to the more solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">merits of our display. That Winter, to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a la mode, was to have bought one's outfit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Bonnemaison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the men it was merely a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking down an article to have it accepted</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once. That often it was the duplicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a similar article recently bought made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> no difference. The magic of "from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city" swept all doubts aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was while we were, at the very height</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our success that news came to us of</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching competition. With the fail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure of Gilbeau, its proprietor, more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">year before, the little shop at the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the settlement had remained closed and for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten. Now we heard that it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened again and by no less a person than</seg><seg type="columnLine">my old enemy, Monsieur Dugas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon receiving this intelligence, Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sieur Bonnemaison merely added a shrug</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his smile, but later he displayed what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, for him, a truly remarkable ill-humor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is too bad," he exploded once we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were alone. "It is worse than too bad; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a nuisance. Of course I had expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. He has tried every place but here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Just the same he can hardly interfere</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us," I answered, trying to draw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. "So long as the city goods last, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade will be ours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My effort was wholly successful. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time since I had known him, Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sieur Bonnemaison's small pensive eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were touched with a glint of anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, Jean, this is no time to joke,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he shortly. "Knowing Dugas as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">do, you understand well what I mean. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course you will advise me to stop him at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, but that is impossible. He will come</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a small stock of supplies, and for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while there will be nothing to lay your</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger on. It will all be hidden in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lean-to at the back. Only when trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes can we oust him, and then it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be too late."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why?" I questioned. "What is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">use in going on that way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Monsieur Bonnemaison spread out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is the man," he replied. "Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is mad, who can say? At all events it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is his one desire, the thing that he lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">for. As a merchant, even as the keeper of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a decent coffee-house he would be a suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess. He is a close bargainer, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows how to save.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But he is snot satisfied with honest</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade. Even the edge of the law is too</seg><seg type="columnLine">good for him. Then too he must always</seg><seg type="columnLine">play upon the weakness of another, not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the gain but for the strange pleasure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have seen the kind of man who,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having started a toddling child, will allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">46</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">N LL V I L G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HENSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it to blunder off the porch for his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusement? That is Dugas. He is mean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is cruel, and always he whines when he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">made to pay for his sport. The sooner he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is through here, the better it will be for</seg><seg type="columnLine">every one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two days later Monsieur Dugas de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended upon us. He arrived in a battered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-horse wagon, half-filled with supplies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and having unloaded and haggled with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver, he drove back with him as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monsieur Bonnemaison's store. Here he</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed over the wheel for what he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased to call a friendly understanding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I looked at him, I saw that the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">two years had used him ill. He was thin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, he was more ragged, and his cringe</seg><seg type="columnLine">now bent him almost double. His meager</seg><seg type="columnLine">face bore a hunted look, and beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked twist of his furtive eyes one</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpsed the weariness that is born of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant dread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had come to explain, he said. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening up he had no intention or desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">of taking away any part of Monsieur Bonne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maison's trade. Only let him serve the few</seg><seg type="columnLine">humbler folk who were bewildered by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger store's variety and assortment, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be satisfied. For the rest he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to do anything that might advance</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prosperity of both places.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was all fairly said, but beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words one sensed the true meaning of Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sieur Dugas' visit. Fully aware that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">reputation had traveled before him, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to find out just how much of this-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reputation was actually known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bois Berard, though remote, was within</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy reach of the law. In this particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">undertaking the element of time would</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove a most important factor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having heard his competitor out in cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence, Monsieur Bonnemaison spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">briefly and to the point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The trade is yours if you can get it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugas," said he. "The woods are free to</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. But mind that your business is car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried on in front. That is all I have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he added to me, as without further</seg><seg type="columnLine">words Monsieur Dugas shambled off--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now that he knows, he will work fast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It will not be long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> True to this prophecy, Monsieur Dugas</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed his secret business to the farthest</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible limit. Shunning our place after</seg><seg type="columnLine">that first visit, lie worked feverishly, striv-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ing for the last penny that stood between</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and the inevitable disaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the store we could only watch while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blight of Monsieur Dugas' sinister in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluence spread wider day by day. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade of those unfortunates upon whom the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storekeeper especially preyed was written</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole story of their downfall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First they gave over the buying of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trinkets and non-essentials. Next they</seg><seg type="columnLine">denied themselves in the more important</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of implements and dress. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally, as the vicious circle narrowed down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came a stoppage of supplies, telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hungry mouths left empty for the filling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a bottle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of Monsieur Dugas' several victims the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most pitiful was Hulin, the hunter. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerful if intemperate soul, he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">contented with an occasional debauch upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prairie. Now at the height of the sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son he ranged the woods by day, only that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might spend his nights in carousing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soon his little ones went about pinched and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wary, having in their eyes a wistful appeal</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the smile that had become a blow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was as intolerable as it was hopeless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More than once I visited Monsieur Dugas</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an effort to discover something to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon. And always I found the same as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sortment of unsold tins, the half-sack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">moldy flour, the pyramid of coconuts, worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth by age and much handling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Always the storekeeper received me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mock effusiveness that was maddening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had come to buy? No? Then perhaps</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	would sit down and accept a bottle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rouge. Whereupon he would throw open</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door of the lean-to, showing me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it contained only his pallet and a treasured</seg><seg type="columnLine">crate or two of red pop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He worked well this time, did Monsieur</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugas. Save the elect, none saw so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the drawing of a cork. Had it been pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible to raid him, we would have had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">our trouble for our pains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I watched him uselessly, until with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the approach of Christmas I turned my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts to the more pleasant prospect of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette's return. This year she was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us the best part of a week, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she arrived two days before the feast, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted her with a gasp of consternation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Toi«ette!" I cried. "You have grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not yet, Jean," she smiled. "It is only</seg><seg type="columnLine">my long dress.

If, as she said, she had not grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, she had at least found herself. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this much I was sure even before Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide confirmed it. It was plain to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the steady, untroubled look of her eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the quiet decisiveness of her manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is all right now at the convent?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is more than all right, Jean," she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied. "It is like another home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was a long-remembered Christmas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its presents from St. Pierre and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">store and its late, monstrous dinner, at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended not only by Doctor Poussard but</seg><seg type="columnLine">by my employer himself. Unaccustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he was to dining out, Monsieur</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bonnemaison did not lack in gallantry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But this is fine, madame," he kept re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peating between mouthfuls. "I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that anything so good could come out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my store."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To Toinette he declared:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In your case, mademoiselle, the good</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisters have accomplished a triumph.

"Dugas is getting bold. Either</seg><seg type="columnLine">he depends upon the good-will of the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">or he finds that he is near the end of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps it is the strangers," ventured</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Poussard. "At my place I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them come in from the marsh."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So," answered Monsieur Bonnemaison.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then it is worse than I feared. They will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be easy to handle, those strangers, once</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have had too much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the approach of dusk and the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parture of our guests, the revelry increased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then shortly after dark it rose into a sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den, furious outburst that was heard inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house. Scenting trouble, I hurried out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side to find that the uproar had been suc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded by a silence in which I caught very</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly the thud and rustle of swiftly de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parting feet. Then as I quickened my pace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there shrilled out upon the night the high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin wail of a woman in fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At Monsieur Dugas' I found all that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sought so long. Grown bold, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers had wrecked the place, leaving it</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chaos of empty bottles and scattered sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plies. The windows were smashed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">door had been wrenched away. And in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, amid the litter of broken glass and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trampled food, lay Hulin, his chest a dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">welter of blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To those who gathered about him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only explain that he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbed. There had been a general fight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which the lights had been knocked over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knives had come into play.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When struck, he had screamed, where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon all had rushed out bursting, so it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed, through the very walls. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he had been the only inhabitant pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent. Long before the others had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">scared away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So ended Monsieur Dugas' venture at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bois Berard, for, escaping with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers, the storekeeper disappeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had Hulin's wound proved serious, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been searched for, but, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a few days the hunter recovered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wound in his shoulder, the wood-folk</seg><seg type="columnLine">were content to let well enough alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bien," they said. "Hulin is out and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are rid of Dugas for all time. We should</seg><seg type="columnLine">not complain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the excitement following Monsieur</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugas' flight, Toinette's visit passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. It seemed that she came, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hulin was wounded, that she was gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, all in a few hours. Only after she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had driven away did I realize how little I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen of her.	•</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet for all this I now became possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a thought of Toinette such as I had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">entertained before. It began with a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">remark of Monsieur Bonnemaison's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I miss her, your mademoiselle," said he</seg><seg type="columnLine">one day. "It was good to see her about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where before she was pretty, she is now</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That is so," I agreed idly, but five min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes later Monsieur Bonnemaison's words</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken complete possession of my mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was Toinette beautiful? I asked my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. Was she even pretty? To my amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment I found that it had never occurred to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">R o M ANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">N E V I L G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HENSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">me to consider the matter in any way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Other girls, pretty and plain, I had noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and commented on. Of this phase of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette I had not thought at all. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been satisfied with the mere fact of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">being Toinette.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, thanks to my employer, I discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered that Toinette was possessed of certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks of her own. This much I grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once. But what of these looks? Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a riddle to which I could find no sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isfactory answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pursuing my inquiry, I decided that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not depend upon my own judgment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Viewing Toinette with the eyes of affection,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must find her beautiful in every way. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course I had my employer's opinion, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monsieur Bonnemaison was ever a speaker</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fair words. Perhaps he had been chiefly</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned with the memory of that Christ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mas dinner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thinking on, I dismissed Doctor Pous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sard, whose answer I already knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," he would say. "As beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful as she is good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here I was forced to stop, since of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other inhabitants there vvas not one whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would care to approach with so delicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">a question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Closing time found me obsessed by my</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquiry. I felt that I could have no peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">until this question of Toinette's looks was</seg><seg type="columnLine">definitely settled. As I walked home, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered an appeal to Madame Alcide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in the end I shrank from the idea. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a woman and she might not under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After supper I read so absently that more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than once the old lady shot me an inquir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing glance above her sewing. Then, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading over, I could contain myself no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Madame?" I burst out. "Is Toinette</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As she looked quickly up, Madame Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cide's gaze was strangely hostile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who has said so?" she demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "M'sieu Bonnemaison," I replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There fell a pause, during which Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide gave a little nod, as was her habit</seg><seg type="columnLine">in moments of satisfaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So," said she quietly. "And wh^t do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you think, Jean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can not think," I answered. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">is just the trouble."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vague though this was, Madame Alcide</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed fully to understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then do not try," she advised. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have not troubled about this before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why do so now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And she added, returning to her needle:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beauty is for outside, Jean. In one's</seg><seg type="columnLine">home it is always uncomfortable."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, as we were closing up for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, Madame Alcide broke in upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned calmness of my thoughts with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her rare laughs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, madame?" I inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old lady's smile held fondness to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether with its quaint humor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is you, Jean," she returned. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are truly amusing. Not only have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out that Toinette is a woman, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have made the further remarkable dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery that you yourself are a man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I APPROACH MY AMBITION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT Spring I put in the first of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">cane. It was a small planting of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen acres, yet, having no work-animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">or implements of my own, I was forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go into partnership with Joe Vital, a mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ket-gardener who owned a team. Of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forthcoming profits Vital was to receive</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-half. The balance would be divided</seg><seg type="columnLine">between Madame Alcide and myself, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the furnishers of the land and the seed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This arrangement promised me scant</seg><seg type="columnLine">profits, yet I was well satisfied. Next year</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would plant my own stubble and double</seg><seg type="columnLine">my crop. Also, if I were successful, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have proved the worth of my ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But best of all was the thought that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached my ambition. At last I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reap the reward of those long months</seg><seg type="columnLine">of work and saving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never will I forget that March morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Vital turned up the first brown clods</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the prairie. As they slid smoothly</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, scattering their shower of dewdrops,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought them the most wonderful clods</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all the world. I could hardly have</seg><seg type="columnLine">valued them more, had Nature provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">true jewels for their adornment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standing beside me, Madame Alcide</seg><seg type="columnLine">voiced her approval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROMANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You have done it, Jean," said she.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And in your own way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What do you mean, madame?" I ques-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "With most of our folk the first plant-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing and even the last is done between the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">handles of a plow," she returned. "It is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not often that we can stand and look</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But how could I learn to plow while</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the store?" I objected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Before replying, the old lady surveyed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me with a look of quiet comprehension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That is all right, Jean," said she. "I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">understand. I have understood all along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">That is what I meant when at the very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">first I told you that you aimed high."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After this I treasured my leisure mo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ments that I might spend them in watch-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing the work go on. It fascinated me,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that lumpy, irregular square which Vital</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was creating at the edge of the woods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Each day it lapped farther beyond the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rim of encroaching sod, for all the world</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as if the prairie had been some huge, placid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lake, upon which I had launched the frail</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bark of my endeavor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then, the plowing done, the seed-cane</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">went in, until with the covering of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">final joint Vital withdrew a while, leaving</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the torn earth to be quickened by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">touch of Nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Yet even now I went each day to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">field to dream of the myriad slender</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sprouts that would presently push up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the hidden eyes below. Those shoots</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be stout and many, I told myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They must be. It was unthinkable that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this first crop would prove a failure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And next year there would be many</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more shoots and in the years to come more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">again until-- But I could not go beyond</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that "until." It represented the height of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my achievement. Whfin in their millions</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">those final shoots stretched away beyond</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sight from the trees, I would have reached</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my goal and become a planter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At the store I talked of cane to each</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">small farmer who came along. Gravely I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">discussed the effects of heat and cold, of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rain and drought. More gravely still I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heard of the curse of weeds, the blight of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the borer and the endless kindred evils,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">against which one must guard an infant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crop. It was a time of fear as well as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hope, and often when I considered the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vast, malevolent forces against which I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">must contend, it seemed impossible that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should ever succeed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was at these times that the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">common sense of Monsieur Bonnemaison</seg><seg type="columnLine">made short work of my dejection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pay no attention to those croakers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jean," he would advise. "That is their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fun, to scare the newcomer with all those</seg><seg type="columnLine">things of which they have ceased to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid. I am no farmer, but I have no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticed that, despite the bugs and weeds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new crops come up each year. Yours</seg><seg type="columnLine">will do the same."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the matter of my planting, Monsieur</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bonnemaison was kindness itself. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished me well, and in return I saw to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this new interest did not diminish my</seg><seg type="columnLine">work at the store.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rather it increased it as it increased the</seg><seg type="columnLine">business, for, having aired their opinions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the small farmers came back from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prairie to enlarge upon them. Next, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">true to Monsieur Bonnemaison's predic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions my crop was safely above ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they returned to view it and to instruct</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in those further efforts that would see</seg><seg type="columnLine">it through hot weather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All of this brought trade--new trade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly unexpected. As a consequence</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monsieur Bonnemaison developed an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest in my venture beyond his mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire for my ultimate success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am surprized, Jean," said he. "It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing us out, that little crop of yours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Already it has done as much as the goods</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the city. They are talking far out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the prairie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'You have heard?' says one. 'They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are putting in cane at Bois Berard.' 'So,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">says the other, and turning his back on</seg><seg type="columnLine">those many acres about him, he rides here</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have done well, and next year</seg><seg type="columnLine">you must do better. If necessary I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">help you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually the advent of these new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comers worked a change upon the placid</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence of Monsieur Bonnemaison.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where before he had been gratified by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their custom, he now began to find an</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest in their presence. He talked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. He joked with them. He expanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">visibly beneath their influence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon, becoming tired of the eternal talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">of crops, he took to discussing the no less</seg><seg type="columnLine">important topic of politics. There would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be several elections that Fall, and already</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^ ROMANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">NEViL G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HENSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the prairie-folk were considering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nierits of the various candidates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up to this time Monsieur Bonnemaison's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voting had been both blind and spasmodic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Upon those occasions, when the elections</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not interfered with his work, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone to the polls and cast his ballot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">accordance with the wishes of his friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he discovered that he was entitled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an opinion of his own. Nay, more--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, if he would prove himself a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizen, it was his duty to form such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion and stick to it to the bitter end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly Monsieur Bonnemaison set</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to inform himself through the me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dium of his neighbors. Beginning with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an occasional hurried drive to the stores</seg><seg type="columnLine">and homes of the prairie, he extended his</seg><seg type="columnLine">visits until, with the ending of Spring, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not uncommon for him to be absent a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole afternoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His delight in this new occupation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the toiler who, having achieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">independence, discovers that he still has</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desire and ability to play.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dieu, Jean," he would say. "They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">something, those politics. Where before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had one friend, I now have a dozen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that is good for any one. All along</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have been like a man in jail. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I am free, I mean to enjoy myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was good to see Monsieur Bonne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maison come out of his shell. Looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, Bois Berard understood and ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plauded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let him have his fun," said the wood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">folk. "He has worked hard enough for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the wise ones added:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bonnemaison will play that game well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If we in all these years have failed to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind his smile, how can those others</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect to do so?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What with my cane and Monsieur Bon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nemaison's politics, the Spring passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasantly. With the coming of June,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, I faced a bitter disappointment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shortly before she departed for the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent's exercises, Madame Alcide informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that Toinette would not return with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon her reasons for this decision Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dame Alcide spoke at length. Toinette</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now grown, she said, and it was high</seg><seg type="columnLine">time that she knew' her family. There-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore she would begin by visiting certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lava Is and Berards in and around St.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Pierre. Afterward she would return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the convent and employ such time as re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained of her vacation in preparing her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self for her all-important third year.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madame Alcide laid particular stress</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon that third year. It was the one that</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted, she declared. Let Toinette pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it safely, and she need not worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the fourth year and graduation. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course Toinette was smart, but she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">started late and with only my scant teach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. She could not afford to take chances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was all so simple and convincing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was at a loss to account for the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner in which Madame Alcide dwelt upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. She seldom repeated herself, nor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">it often necessary for her to do so. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end I decided that she was fortifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself against her approaching loneliness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was hard to have Toinette miss my</seg><seg type="columnLine">first crop. Often at the camp, when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spoken of my ambition, she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out to the marsh-grass, saying:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look, Jean. Your cane will be like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now that I had my cane--real,</seg><seg type="columnLine">living, growing canc--she was not there to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see. 1 could only console myself with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that next year she would behold</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in all the impressiveness of my increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">acreage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the Summer came, depriving me of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette yet bringing me new tasks that</seg><seg type="columnLine">did much to atone for her absence. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field my cane was well up and thriv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, so that each spare moment found me</seg><seg type="columnLine">assisting Vital in the work of cultivation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the store my duties increased daily as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monsieur Bonnemaison followed the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">evitable course of his development. Urged</seg><seg type="columnLine">on by his friends, he now fell a victim to</seg><seg type="columnLine">political ambition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For years the ward of which Bois Berard</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a part had bee'n represented upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police jury by General Marsh. There had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been no canvassing of votes, no contest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard to this office. As the leader of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">section, the general had been chosen unani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he announced that, following his</seg><seg type="columnLine">present term, he' could serve no longer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also he made no suggestion as to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">successor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This returned the office to the realm of</seg><seg type="columnLine">politics. True, the election would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">held for nearly a year, but this merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased the possibilities of the situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">.MCE	zr,</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">With so many months to work in, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prairie-folk could be depended upon to</seg><seg type="columnLine">conduct a campaign that would make po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">litical history.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I As a consequence Monsieur Bonne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maison departed from the first preliminary</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirmish to find himself a candidate. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends had asked him to run and, half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewildered, he had given his consent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That this bewilderment was due rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Monsieur Bonnemaison's modesty than</seg><seg type="columnLine">to any apprehension he might have felt at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prospect of holding office became</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly apparent. Once he had consid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the matter and gotten his bearings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fairly bubbled over with delight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is too much," he declared. "To</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that I, the beginner, should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">chosen. I could not answer when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked me. I could only nod my agree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and get away as quickly as possible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I will show them if I get in. pood</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads and safe bridges will speak for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Following his elation, Monsieur Bonne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maison entered upon a more sober period,</seg><seg type="columnLine">during which with the aid of his support-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers he mapped out a campaign. This ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complished, he called me into his office</seg><seg type="columnLine">one evening as I was preparing to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the store.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Next week I start my canvass," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began. "April is a long way off, but Dau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trive has come out, and it is said that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pesson will run also. This means a fight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a fight it is often the first blow that</seg><seg type="columnLine">counts. Also, having struck my blow, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean to keep on striking until the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">day of the election. Thus you will be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge again, Jean; this time for months,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That is all right, m'sieu," said I. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can depend upon me to do my best."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Monsieur Bonnemaison waved this as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surance aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course, Jean," said he. "That is</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood. The question is, how can I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do my best? With your cane, the store</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be. too much even in Summer. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have some one to help you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused, leaving me fairly staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his suggestion. Monsieur Bonnemaison</seg><seg type="columnLine">with two clerks! He was coming out</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is good of you, m'sieu," said I.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If I could have help on Saturdays, it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would be easier. You have thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he replied, Monsieur Bonnemaison's</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile was touched with a fleeting kindness</seg><seg type="columnLine">--kindness not only for myself but for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one he had in mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What of Poussard?" he questioned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ever since my trip to the city he has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging about. If you are satisfied, I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak to him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus it was arranged, and upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following Saturday the little doctor re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported for duty at the store. So timidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased, so pitifully grateful was he that</seg><seg type="columnLine">even Monsieur Bonnemaison was touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the effect of his benevolence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dieu, Jean," he said to me. "I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing Poussard for the first time. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">now can I appreciate how hard it has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The truth of this I appreciated myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the weeks that followed. It had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard for the little doctor, far harder than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of us would ever know. To his lone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liness, his lack of true occupation, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been added a poverty that made a humili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation of the very food that went into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. For Doctor Poussard had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride, the fine pride of one who, scorning</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrender, accepts and fights on in the hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some day being able to repay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In proof of this he refused to accept</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a portion of the small amount that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I offered him upon his first Saturday night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Jean," he said. "It must go upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">my account. As you perhaps know, I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">an arrangement with your employer. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is good to pay back. One can spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">money in no pleasanter manner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once he had mastered the stock and</seg><seg type="columnLine">prices, the little doctor proved an able</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistant. Always quiet and considerate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he performed his duties with all the thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oughness and precision of his military</seg><seg type="columnLine">training.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also he served his customers with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave courtesy hitherto unknown at our</seg><seg type="columnLine">establishment. The wood-folk liked to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited upon by Doctor Poussard. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">left him with a most gratifying estimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their own importance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon there arose a demand for him which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monsieur Bonnemaison was only too will-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to satisfy. Accordingly with the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proach of midsummer he offered the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor a permanent place in the store.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never will I forget the manner in which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            ROMANCE L</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                                 0</seg><seg type="columnLine">r</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51	NEV1L C.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Poussard accepted his promotion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If before we had been touched by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratitude, his joy and relief was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to dim one's eyes. Perhaps that</seg><seg type="columnLine">period of uncertainty had been harder for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him than anything he had known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now that he was sure, the little doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like a man transformed. Gone from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes was the plaintive anxiety, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its place came a look of peace. Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride his stooped shoulders regained a hint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their former squareness. Touched by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warm glow of prosperity, his very</seg><seg type="columnLine">brownness took on a mellower hue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His medicine and his mattresses he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at once, taking down his signs upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very afternoon of his talk with Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sieur Bonnemaison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see, Jean, it would not do for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to retain these outside affairs," he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained. "I could only attend to them by</seg><seg type="columnLine">neglecting the interests of my employer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus my practise and my manufactory are</seg><seg type="columnLine">things of the past. Now that the signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">are down, my patrons will understand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am done with them entirely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Good Doctor Poussard! Even in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">retirement he wrought a lasting cure upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his most profitable patient. For, follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her enjoyment of his success, Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide achieved a state of health in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">her migraine entirely disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having established the little doctor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monsieur Bonnemaison removed his activi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties to the store-porch. He would be there</seg><seg type="columnLine">to advise and to greet the customers. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest we could attend to inside. Now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had two clerks, he would make the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. Such time as was allowed him'</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his supporters he meant to taka at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So said Monsieur Bonnemaison, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so the word went round that when at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bois Berard he could always be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the store. Each day he held court</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his old armchair. Each day he talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">politics to an increasing audience, smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">his inscrutable smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And well might Monsieur Bonnemaison</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile, for it was very hot and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved the problem of his canvass. Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he had gone to the voters, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voters now came to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet it was Monsieur Bonnemaison's ill</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck that of all these voters the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">important should call at a moment whan</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was away from the store. Thus the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 ROM.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HENSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">newcomer was received by Doctor Pous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sard, who called back to me in a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrill with excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '•Quick, Jean,'1 he warned.

Their less thrifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbors viewed the future more darkly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is money without comfort?" they</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To dig up the ground was hard work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially in Summer. No one but a sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleton would wish to exchange a gun for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hoe. If the planting kept on, all sensible</seg><seg type="columnLine">folk would move farther inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless I did not lack for labor</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the time came to cut my crop. Bois</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berard might grumble, but it could be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended upon to make the most of such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the appointed day I had my pick of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire settlement. The wood-folk fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought for possession of the few cane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">knives that I had ordered from St. Pierre.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterward they made a game of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, some of them slashing in with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandon of one repelling an attack; others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more delicately humored, pretending to</seg><seg type="columnLine">engage in a duel with each separate stalk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">This, while fun for the onlookers, meant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ruin to the cane. Had I not interfered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my crop would have been speedily reduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fragments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, when the first cart was loaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Vital had climbed aboard it, the wood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">folk were outspoken in their pride.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Show them what we are, Joe," they</seg><seg type="columnLine">called. "Remember you are not peddling</seg><seg type="columnLine">game at M'sieu the General's back door."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All along I had looked forward to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment when I would make this first jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney to Marsh Island. Now that it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived, I found that I must forego my</seg><seg type="columnLine">small triumph. In the first place I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no handler of mules and would therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove merely an additional burden to Vital</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the others whom I had engaged to move</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crop. In the second it was necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I remain in the field to superintend</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work of the cutters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vital must look after the weighing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">collect the receipts, leaving me to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the final settlement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was disappointing to wait for the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">loads, but when they were ready, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">recompensed for my delay by the thought-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulness of Monsieur Bonnemaison. I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">use his driving-horse, he declared. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only would it be more comfortable, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would appear to better advantage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After all, I was a planter despite my</seg><seg type="columnLine">few acres. It would not do for me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrive in a cart like any common laborer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus I set out in style, trotting ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my small cavalcade upon the broad back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Monsieur Bonnemaison's animal. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">day was crisp and clear, and as I reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the causeway, a sudden breeze rippled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bay, spicing the air with a tang</seg><seg type="columnLine">of saltiness. Beneath its touch the tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass bowed gravely, while the myrtles flut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered their tiny leaves as if in mockery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such sedateness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the same old marsh, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of its waving grass brought back my</seg><seg type="columnLine">last afternoon at Bayou Portage. Poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Papa Ton! What if he could see me</seg><seg type="columnLine">now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cane is for the rich, Jean," he had said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Only with a .trap can you get your for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune out of the ground."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reaching the island, I took a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction from the one adopted upon my</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey with Monsieur Dugas. Now I</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned off to the left, along a road that</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled the base of a hill. Following this</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a tangle of woodland, I came</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROMANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">NEVIL G. HENSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">finally to open ground. And here I drew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up with a suddenness that brought a snort</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of protest from my indignant mount, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the cane-fields lay before me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Long was I to remember my first view</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of these fields. Perhaps they were not as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vast as those that encircled the great re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fineries of St. Pierre. Perhaps they lacked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the network of rails, the puffing dummies</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that made for modern efficiency. Yet in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the wide, free sweep of their level acres, in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the flood of green that billowed from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">marsh to hillside, they expressed in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fullest degree all that for which I longed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   As I gazed at them, I felt g. great and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tender pity for my father. It was some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing to have lost those fields. No wonder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he had been gray before his time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Riding on between the tall ranks of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cane, I came presently to the mill, a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">squat affair of brick and plaster, topped by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an ancient stack. From its low-pitched</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shed came the rich, heavy odor of the open</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">kettles. About its narrow carrier the cane</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was piled in huge glistening mounds. In-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">side its worn rollers clanked and rattled as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if in wean' effort, while they crunched their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">way through the never ceasing stream of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stalks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It was small and old and hopelessly old-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fashioned, yet about it there was some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing that had been wholly lacking in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">refineries of St. Pierre. They were huge,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">those refineries, but they were also frankly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">commercial. Here one found in all its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">charm and fragrance the true enchantment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of grinding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It was not easy to leave this mill. Long</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">after the carts had been unloaded and I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had finished my business at the scales, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hung about, absorbed in the busy scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Each detail was like a tonic to me; the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">roar of the boilers, the drip of the juice,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the slap of the carrier that perhaps even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then was carrying a load from Bois Berard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   When finally I rode off. I promised my-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">self that some day I would have such a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mill of my own. Already I could picture</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it nestled snugly amid the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">So I returned with my thoughts in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">future, until near the edge of the fields I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came upon the general. He trotted out'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon me suddenly from a field-road, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at that moment it seemed a chance meet-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing. Only afterward did I understand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that he had ridden there purposely to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">intercept me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well?" he inquired, after I had saluted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him. ''Has everything been satisfactory?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Perfectly so, m'sieu," I replied. "I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would like to sell to you next year."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "So you mean to keep on?" he ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Ah, yes, m'sieu," said I eagerly. "Next</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">year I will have twice as much--perhaps</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more if M'sieu Bonnemaison helps me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The general considered this a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He seemed almost impressed by my en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thusiasm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Then you intend to be a farmer rather</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than a storekeeper?" he observed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That is it, m'sieu," I agreed. "I hope</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some day to be a planter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Not until I had spoken did I realize my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mistake. In a way I had corrected the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">general.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Pardon, m'sieu," said I quickly. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean that I would like to become a</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There fell a pause, during which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general eyed me absently. Then he spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a strangely detached voice, as if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">iflHering his thoughts aloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No," he mused. "You were right at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first. You will never be a farmer. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">will plant from the saddle or not at all."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He checked himself and added with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift return to his usual tone--"How</seg><seg type="columnLine">would you like to come here for the next,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crop?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was so sudden, so wholly unexpected,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that I could only stammer in reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean, m'sieu--you mean--" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">began.	..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  irExactly," broke in the general. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">need a man in the field and I have heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">you well spoken of. If you are willing, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can use you as soon as the crop is off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His words restored my confidence. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">held no kindliness, no hint of good-will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to justify my confusion. He needed a man,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and he had heard me well spoken of. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was merely a matter of business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Before answering him, I looked out over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the wide sweep of the cane. Truly it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a temptation. A year at Marsh Island</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be a priceless experience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then I thought of Monsieur Bonne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maison, of the store, of those useless acres</seg><seg type="columnLine">of prairie that I might redeem for Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcfde.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "M'sieu," said I, "I am very grateful to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you for your offer, but I can not accept</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it. My duty lies in the woods. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be right for me to leave there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The general's eyes were fierce as I fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished. Evidently he was ill used to refusal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For an instant he appeared upon the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bursting into angry speech. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed his cold indifference, wheeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">about with a jerk of the bridle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you wish," said he curtly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned off into the field-road, leaving me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stare after him with a curiously mingled</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of relief and disappointment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Riding on, I reviewed our meeting until</seg><seg type="columnLine">I reached the point where the general had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to speak his thoughts aloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he had said. "You will never be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a farmer. You will plant from the saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not at all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here was something to consider. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had the general meant? And now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I thought of it, Madame Alcide had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made some similar remark upon the occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of my first plowing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First Madame Alcide, and now the gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral. Why should they comment upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the manner in which I had planted my</seg><seg type="columnLine">crop?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The puzzle of this held me throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of my ride. So far as I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, I was putting in my cane in the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion. And if I were not, why should</seg><seg type="columnLine">these two be so concerned at my going</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the matter in my own particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">way?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AN EVENTFUL SPRING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Spring that followed was a famous</seg><seg type="columnLine">one for Bois Berard. With March it</seg><seg type="columnLine">found me planting, not twice, but a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">four times the amount of my former</seg><seg type="columnLine">acreage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This increase, the work of my employer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far beyond my highest expectations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">True, Monsieur Bonnemaison had offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to help me, but I had never thought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his assistance would take so substantial a</seg><seg type="columnLine">form. In this case, however, his caution</seg><seg type="columnLine">haci been tempered by a fine sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon my return from Marsh Island I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been careful to give no hint of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">interview with the general. Nevertheless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the mysterious fashion of such commu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nities, word of it had gone abroad. Upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">its reaching the woods, Monsieur Bonne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maison called me to him at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So, Jean," said he. "I have just heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of M'sieu the General and yourself. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have behaved well, and you shall not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loser by it. In the Spring you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus Monsieur Bonnemaison made good</seg><seg type="columnLine">his words at planting time by doubling my</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected crop. This meant much work</seg><seg type="columnLine">and planning to meet the requirements of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his added acres. Teams must be found.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Implements must be bought, together with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an extra supply of seed-cane. Also there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the problem of additional labor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this the wood-folk seemed little in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clined to help me. For the most part they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were content to look on with a virtuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">indolence born of their efforts at grinding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had cut my crop or they had of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered to do so, which amounted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same thing. Now they meant to rest until</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool weather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a difficult time and one in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I might have fared badly, had not Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sieur Bonnemaison again come to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistance. Owning several cabins, he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">their tenants the choice of going into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field or of making way for workers from</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This aroused a storm of protest, followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the threat of a general exodus, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it all Monsieur Bonnemaison stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm. In the end the wood-folk turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their natural philosophy and shrugged a</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrender.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bien," they said. "It is our crop any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Why should we leave it to these dirt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grubbers from the prairie?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the inhabitants went to work and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">began a period of prosperity for Bois</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berard. If at first there was grumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and discontent, this soon disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the magic of regular wages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wood-folk might love their ease, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could not blind themselves to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantages of a weekly pay-roll.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the crop was in, Hulin, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunter, had taken his turn in the field.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had been wrong, he admitted. A hoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">was surer than a gun. You never missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">your dinner with a hoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In April cane gave place to politics.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now that the elections were close at hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question of votes became all-absorb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Supported by the general, Monsieur</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROMANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">r</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">56	NEVIL G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Bonnemaison had seemed certain of vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory, but there was always the danger that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his opponents would combine. This they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did at the last moment, Pesson dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to give his support to the more prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ising Dautrive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then began a bitter fight that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">waged to the casting of the final ballot. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a contest to delight the Cajun heart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when at its end Monsieur Bonnemaison</seg><seg type="columnLine">was declared the winner, he was fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcome by his emotion. Called on for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a speech, he could only utter a few broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Later, my friends," he choked. "Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">now I can say nothing. But I will show</seg><seg type="columnLine">you all what I feel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This promise Monsieur Bonnemaison</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept in May by holding a general celebra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Half-fete, half-barbecue, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">attended by friend and foe alike. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the farthest limits of the prairie the voters</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to enjoy Monsieur Bonnemaison's</seg><seg type="columnLine">boundless hospitality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a whole day there was eating and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinking, enlivened by various sports.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horses were run, chickens were fought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">games were played of every kind. Also</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monsieur Bonnemaison atoned for his for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer muteness 'by delivering a speech of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks in the late afternoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among the many guests was Monsieur</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugas. He crept in alone from the prairie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vacant, imbecile-creature, with drooling</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips and lifeless eyes. All through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">merrymaking he stumbled about, babbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tale of his wrongs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was M'sieu the General, he kept re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peating. It had always been M'sieu the</seg><seg type="columnLine">General. It would be like that until he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugas, had had a settlement. And so he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on, half-whining, half-threatening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly regardless of the haste with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">his listeners hurried away from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon inquiry I learned that Monsieur</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugas had met disaster while hiding in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marsh. Some one had struck him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, and afterward he had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer. Now he was back on the prairie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he drifted about, existing precari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously upon such crumbs of charity as were</seg><seg type="columnLine">grudgingly thrown him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was quite harmless, but he was also</seg><seg type="columnLine">very tiresome with his eternal arraignment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of M'sieu the General. This was his one</seg><seg type="columnLine">obsession. For all his trials and misfor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HENSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tunes he blamed the owner of Marsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">Island.	,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poor Monsieur Dugas! His plight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitiful, yet it earned him little sympathy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those who took trouble to speak to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared that he was justly punished for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil deeds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following Monsieur Bonnemaison's</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech, the guests departed, the late ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">being lighted upon their way by a bon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire that had been kindled at the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the prairie. So ended the celebration,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fitting close to that memorable Spring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the arrival of June, Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide made ready for her annual pilgrim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age to the convent. Once again she set</seg><seg type="columnLine">out alone, for despite the offer of a well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">earned holiday, Doctor Poussard could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be induced to leave his post.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is impossible," he said to us. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">business might suffer. Also madame would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not allow it. I have explained, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">agrees with me in every way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a far different Poussard from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forlorn creature of that former deser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. As he spoke, his voice held almost a</seg><seg type="columnLine">note of authority. Well clothed and well</seg><seg type="columnLine">fed, he had none of the officiousness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is often the outcome of unexpected pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perity. Rather he was quietly pleased that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his own simple way he had justified his</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for Monsieur Bonnemaison and my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, we were well satisfied to have him</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain. Through our outside duties the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little doctor had become indispensable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Often he was left in charge for the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During Madame Alcide's absence I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought much of Toinette. Save for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief visit at the second Christmas I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not seen her in two years. Would she be</seg><seg type="columnLine">much changed, I wondered. Already I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thought her grown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now she was eighteen, and for Bois</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berard eighteen meant a woman in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Often girls were married there at</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixteen. But of course Toinette would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of marrying.. Did she not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Alcide and myself? The idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ridiculous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To my surprize I found Toinette little</seg><seg type="columnLine">different at first. Save that she was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">undeniably grown, she seemed very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same. In the matter of looks she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly convincing. One glance at her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my problem of the months before was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROMANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">definitely solved. Despite my prejudiced</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes I knew that Monsieur Bonnemaison</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spoken truly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a week Toinette was once more my</seg><seg type="columnLine">comrade of the marsh. Indeed, she seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have become a girl again, as she fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed me about through field and forest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her delight at my cane was almost childish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each detail must be explained to her, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">she listened round-eyed with amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jean, Jean," she would cry. "It is too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much. However did you do it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In those days I felt immeasurably older</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wiser than Toinette. It was the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent, I told myself. What else could one</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect after being shut in for all those</seg><seg type="columnLine">months.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, when the crop had become a mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of course and Toinette had settled down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the life of the woods, I began to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain misgivings. Perhaps my_first esti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate had been slightly wrong. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette had not been so childish as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had appeared. She was so calm, so direct,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so quietly sure of herself. It was just pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible that she had made the most of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">achievement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That would be like Toinette. Had she</seg><seg type="columnLine">not done the same thing when Papa Ton</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left me in charge?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually these doubts became a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty. Gradually 1 came to know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my twenty years were as nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette's eighteen. If she had been shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, it had been to good purpose. During</seg><seg type="columnLine">those months she had gone far ahead of me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this time I often recalled my days of</seg><seg type="columnLine">convalescence at Bayou Portage. In her</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude Toinette seemed somehow to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone back to them. It was as if I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become little Jean again and she had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">commenced my instruction in the business</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet like little Jean I soon conquered</seg><seg type="columnLine">my resentment. Once more I set myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn, and in learning I came to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Toinette and I had reached a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfection of companionship. Where be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore we had shared the present, we now had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the future together--a wonderful golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">future, impossible for the marsh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With Toinette this future meant a life</seg><seg type="columnLine">of teaching. From her first month at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">convent she had hoped for it, but it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed too much. Now with the ending of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her third year she was almost sure. Al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">• ready she had taught the little children</seg><seg type="columnLine">successfully. The good sisters declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she had found her true vocation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  All this Toinette told me in confidence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exacting my promise that I would say noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of it to Madame Alcide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even now it is no more than a hope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jean," she said to me. "Only after I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished can I be certain. Then it will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to tell Tante Aurore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "If I told her now and failed, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not stand it. Tante Aurore has been far</seg><seg type="columnLine">too good to me to risk such a thing. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of what it will mean, Jean. Think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all those little ones seeking the chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I shall be able to give them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was Toinette grown. Always she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been generous with the few good things</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her life. Now, having received this gift</seg><seg type="columnLine">of education, she found her chief joy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her ability to share it with others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was a long-remembered June.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each of its sunlit days brought an added</seg><seg type="columnLine">contentment. Looking ahead, I saw only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warm, drowsy peace of a perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">Summer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then a cloud appeared to mar this fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon. •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WAY OF THE WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RETURNING one afternoon from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field, I found a visitor at Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide's. It was young Latour of St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pierre, and he sat upon the gallery, talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Toinette. Always mindful of his ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance, Latour was dressed with especial</seg><seg type="columnLine">care. His horse, tied to the rack in front,</seg><seg type="columnLine">represented the last word in grooming and</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This much I saw at a glance, yet it told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me nothing. As the older Latour was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholesale dealer much favored by Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sieur Bonnemaison, I concluded that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sent his son to the woods upon some</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Our greeting over, I waited for Latour</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make known his errand. This he seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">little inclined to do, for after a few com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monplace remarks he resumed his conver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation with Toinette.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The talk now turned to that part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Summer when Toinette had visited her rel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atives. Evidently the relatives had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">58</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NE V I L G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HENSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">much of this occasion. There had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dances and other entertainments, to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Latour had replied by giving a picnic of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this Toinette had told me, touching</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it lightly. I had not been interested,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she had quickly passed on to something</seg><seg type="columnLine">else. Now, assisted by Latour, she made it</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subject of an animated discussion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was very gay and pleasant, yet I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the uncomfortable feeling of being an out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sider. Also I became painfully aware of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roughness of my field-clothes. I wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had come in from the back or that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Latour had waited until Sunday for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit. That was the day for calls anyhow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then you could be sure of meeting people</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon more equal terms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When finally I went into the house, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered Latour with a distinct sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">injury. First he had fooled me in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of his visit. Next he had made me</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel ashamed of my clothes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later Madame Alcide invited Latour to</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper. When it was over, he delayed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">departure until moonrise. This time Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dame Alcide took her place upon the gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lery, and the talk was both varied and</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless I felt that I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheated. Certain things had occurred in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field which I had wished to discuss with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette. Now they would be overshad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">owed by the work of another day. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">all been very tiresome and unsettling. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">Latour trotted off, I hoped that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take his own good time in coming again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following his visit, Toinette had other</seg><seg type="columnLine">callers. Perhaps Latour had told the tale</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a pretty girl at Bois Berard. Perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing of it already, the others had</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely waited for him to set an example.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At all events the young men began to ride</seg><seg type="columnLine">in from St. Pierre and the prairie to spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour or so upon Madame Alcide.'s front</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallery. As for Latour, his visits increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he seemed fairly to haunt the woods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Disturbed myself, I had expected Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dame Alcide to be the same. In the well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered life of her household there should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been no place for these bothersome</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers. Yet she accepted it all as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of course. She even went farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">and discovered an advantage in the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," she would say to Toinette.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We are not wholly uncivilized. Also it is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nice to receive your friends in your own</seg><seg type="columnLine">home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toinette I gave up in despair. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible that she should submit to so</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupid an experience. A little coldness</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon her part, and the callers would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken their attentions elsewhere. Then we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have returned to our interrupted</seg><seg type="columnLine">companionship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Toinette bore with it patiently. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">times she seemed genuinely pleased. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways she was so pleasant and cordial that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the callers made haste to return. Yet she</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave no hint of vanity. All her life she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had won attention. She accepted it as her</seg><seg type="columnLine">due.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this time I-suffered no pang of jeal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously. I was troubled, perplexed, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gusted, perhaps, but my feelings went little</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther. True, I knew only too well what</seg><seg type="columnLine">this calling meant. Latour was deadly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnest, as were several of the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet I viewed their efforts with a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixture of pity and contempt. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly futile that these young men should</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride so far and so often for a girl who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never have them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sure of Toinette before, I was doubly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of her now. Did she not mean to</seg><seg type="columnLine">teach? Then how could she do so with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">home and family? The callers were merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasting their time. They might be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nuisance, but I could find in them no cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">for apprehension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus I argued, fairly convinced that with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passing of time these foolish intruders</seg><seg type="columnLine">would realize the hopelessness of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">quest. But for all my assurance they con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued to intrude. Always they were rid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and driving in, either to call or to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette to some entertainment outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mid-Summer found me thoroughly ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">asperated. Toinette's vacation was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than half over. Also it had devel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oped into a constant source of irritation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">True, the callers spent many evenings</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, but I could never count upon them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the very moment when I wanted them</seg><seg type="columnLine">least, they were certain to appear. If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">complained, Madame Alcide was quick to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remind me that Toinette was having a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good time. This was so, perhaps, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was having an exceeding]}' bad one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It did not occur to me that I might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">both stupid and selfish. I had been so</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy in store and field that I knew nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of even the crude social life of the woods.</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">50</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I had paid no calls nor had I attended the</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional balls and dances. Thanks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Alcide and her books, I had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">my amusement at home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus I was unable either to understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">or accept the inevitable outcome of Toin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ette's attractiveness. Instead I sulked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloomed like an ill-natured boy. It was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">so trifling and useless. Why could they</seg><seg type="columnLine">not leave Toinette alone?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And next Summer it would be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same. I knew that now. This much at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least had been hammered into me by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">persistency of the callers. It made no dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference that Toinette did not intend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry. As long as she remained young and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty, she would be sought after.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Added to these annoyances -was the talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">that went about. Ever eager for gossip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wood-folk made the most of Toinette's</seg><seg type="columnLine">popularity. Each week brought some new</seg><seg type="columnLine">and startling rumor. Toinette had ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepted Latour. She had made her choice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but she would not announce it until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day of her return to the convent. A dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">times she was reported to have eloped, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was even said once that she was already</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretly married.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That this talk was as silly as it was idle</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew only too well, yet in due time it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had its effect. With every one predicting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette's speedy marriage, I began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt my former convictions. The wood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">folk might be extravagant, but I had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wit to know that in the main they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussing a very ordinary possibility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Other girls -married, leaving father and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother. Why should not Toinette, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">orphan, do the same? True, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">her plan to teach, and to it I clung with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strength of despair. It remained for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Poussard to shatter this final hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As loyal as he was punctilious, the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor had taken no part in the gossip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Always he had frowned upon it, uttering</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sharp reprimand whenever the talk ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">too freely at the store. Thug, when after</seg><seg type="columnLine">such an outburst we found ourselves alone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gave vent to his indignation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dieu, these tongue-waggers! " he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed. "Nothing is sacred to them, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a young girl's name."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is so," I agreed. "They think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Toinette is like the rest. It is beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to see that she will never marry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It happened that Doctor Poussard was</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged in arranging some goods upon a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shelf. I was thankful for this, for I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would reply without looking up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just then I was not anxious for the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor's regard. There had been an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken challenge in my words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accepting my challenge, Doctor Pous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sard made 'light of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, Jean, that is a good one," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">joked. "Toinette never marry? You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">outgossiping the gossips."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just the same it is so," I persisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubbornly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time the little doctor looked up be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore replying. Evidently he wished to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make sure that I was in earnest. He spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly yet kindly, his tone suggesting in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction rather than argument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Jean, you are wrong," said he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Toinette will marry. The Toinettes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this world always marry. They must do</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, if only to be let alone. You will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky if she is 'unpromised a year from</seg><seg type="columnLine">now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A question rushed to my lips, yet I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not put it fairly. I could only utter a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague compromise.	**</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what if a girl has--has plans?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this the little doctor smiled, not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirth but with a stark bitterness that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible to see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Plans?" he echoed, and in his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was the weariness of one who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">spanned the reach of endless barren years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ah, yes, we all have plans. That is what</seg><seg type="columnLine">is -called 'ambition.' We strive and hope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then something comes along and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">find ourselves concerned only with the ne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessity to keep going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused and suddenly he was the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Poussard again, calm and gentle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravely resigned to the tyranny of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Plans will not do, Jean," he finished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Each girl has plans until the right man</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following this talk, I reached a state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">final desperation. Try as I might, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not doubt the little doctor. He had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all too unpleasantly plain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toinette would marry. There could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt of that. Her ambition would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten once the right man came along.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he would come. He always came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Otherwise there would be few marriages</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was dreadful to think of losing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette, but there seemed nothing that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">60	NE V I L G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could do. It was life, nature, the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world. One could not stand out</seg><seg type="columnLine">against such things. One could only accept</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, patiently if possible, like Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poussard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I tormented myself through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathless days of August. Then, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Summer had all but burned itself away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had a sudden inspiration. In a flash I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a way out--a simple, easy way that</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant happiness for every one. Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette must marry, I would marry her</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself. That would settle the matter for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following the relief of this discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a vast amazement at my blindness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stupidity. It was incredible that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not thought of this before. Why, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only what I would have been forced to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">in course of time. Toinette and I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not brother and sister. Once Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide was gone, we could no longer live</seg><seg type="columnLine">together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I had not considered this. Absorbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the store and my crop, I had blundered</seg><seg type="columnLine">along with never a thought of the future.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now that I faced it, I was aghast at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">risk I had run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madame Alcide was old. Toinette was</seg><seg type="columnLine">young and desirable. Should the one die,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other marry, I would be left entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This thought brought panic. What if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too late? What if Toinette had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready given her promise? There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">Latour and the rest. They had been mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their try, while I in my ignorance had</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked on laughing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was plain that I had played the fool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet like all who accomplish this feat I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">little inclined to accept the consequences</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my folly. If I had delayed, I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make up for it with immediate action. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised myself that I would speak to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette that very night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WAY OF TOINETTE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FORTUNATELY there was no caller</seg><seg type="columnLine">that evening, although, had one ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared, his stay would have been brief. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">overwrought was I that I would have gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">to any length to be rid of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet for all this I did not speak to Toin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HENSH A W</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ette immediately after supper. Instead I</seg><seg type="columnLine">nursed my impatience until the sun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">well down below the forest-rim. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the woods were gray and shadowy</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the mystery of the twilight, I pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared to act.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come," said I. "We will go as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big oak."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Walking along with Toinette at my side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I lost my fears for a sense of security. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">now seemed that I had been the victim of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my imagination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toinette was so natural, so wholly her</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual self. Surely she could not be like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that unless she were heart-whole. She must</seg><seg type="columnLine">show the stress of a secret promise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each moment my confidence increased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was in time, and I also felt that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">entitled to a certain preferment. Even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I were not the right man spoken of by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Poussard, I was at least the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in Toinette's experience, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">must count for something.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I went on, masking my thoughts be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind a chatter of small talk, until the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk of the big oak reared itself above its</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesser neighbors. Beyond the ground was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet and boggy from the seepage of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">near-by marsh, so that there was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it but to turn back toward the settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Facing about, I gripped my courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Toinette," I began, "you remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">that last day at the camp?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," she replied. "How can I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever forget it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you have not forgotten the meet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at Tante Odile's," I went on. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to stay, and when madame declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">it impossible, you said that we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry and keep on as before. You remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber this also?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," answered Toinette. "I remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber it well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you meant it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you know--every word."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now?" I questioned. "What if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to happen now? Would you say the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same and mean it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus far Toinette had followed me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the half-idle interest of one who discusses</seg><seg type="columnLine">a well-remembered past. Now at my last</seg><seg type="columnLine">words she turned upon me with a startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftness that held almost a hint of fear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come, Jean, what is it?" she demanded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do you mean-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Toinette," said I. answering her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MCE -</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">61</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">unspoken thought. "That is what I mean.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want you to marry me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a space Toinette was silent as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at me through the dusk. Having</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken, I had looked away so that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch no glimpse of her features. Yet I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that she stared. I could feel her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes pass over me like carefully searching</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. ^Then came her voice, half-shy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-glad, yet having about it a quiet in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistence that was like a supplement to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why, Jean?" she questioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had she spoken in some foreign tongue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would have found it easier to reply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why indeed?" I asked myself. True, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have uttered some pretty speech but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew that Toinette was not asking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty speeches. She wanted the truth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And what was the truth? For the life of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me I could not say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why?" I echoed lamely. "Why does</seg><seg type="columnLine">any man ask a girl to marry him? Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause he wishes her to be his wife."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So," said Toinette and turned abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">back again for all the world as if she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been fully answered. Anxious and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered, I fell into step beside her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" I asked, after I had waited in</seg><seg type="columnLine">vain for her to speak. "What have you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, Toinette?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, what can I say but 'yes,' Jean,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she replied. "Am I not yours as I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">always been? Have we not belonged to</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other since that Christmas Eve when,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in spite of my warning, you cast your lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">with ours? You knew what it meant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay, yet you did not say no.. How can I</seg><seg type="columnLine">say 'no' now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though her voice was flat and dead, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid no heed. How could I know that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the weariness of disappointment?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the memory of that Christmas</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eve, of course. Her thoughts had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to a dark and bitter time. Then too</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was fully occupied with my own sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of relief and satisfaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then that is all right, Toinette," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">I. "You have taken a load from my mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have been worried, T can tell you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dim though the light was, I could catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the puzzled look that came into Toinette's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Worried?" she questioned. "Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was Latour," I explained, "Latour</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah," exclaimed Toinette, and now she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was quick and eager. "Then you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">jealous, Jean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps," I answered vaguely. "I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But if it was M'sieu Latour and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rest-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She broke off and added smiling--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Those boys!* It was foolish of you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jean."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just the same I was worried," I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on doggedly. "I feared that you might</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry. And what would become of me</seg><seg type="columnLine">then if anything happened to madame?''</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette considered this for what seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very long time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," said she finally. "Then it is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much that you wish to marry me as that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you do not wish me to marry some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">else?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was rather complex for one in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," I struggled, "it is not that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then what is it?" persisted Toinette</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercilessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dieu," I exploded, at the end of my re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sources. "I am all mixed up. I want you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette. That is all I know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By now we had reached the clearing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bordered that end of the settlement. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead loomed the vague outline of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">store, dark and deserted since the flight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monsieur Dugas. Beyond the cabin lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood out against the dusk like soft re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flections of the stars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wc were almost back again, yet I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">halt. Instead I pushed blindly forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">until Toinette, swinging in before me, laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">a detaining hand upon my shoulder. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came her other hand, and her eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled and penitent, looked into mine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jean, Jean," she pleaded. "You must</seg><seg type="columnLine">not go back like this. Why, it is almost a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarrel, the first that we have ever had.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If I have teased you, I am sorry. But you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so serious, Jean. Now we will =.it</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and you will tell me what you do</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean--that is, if you know yourself."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Releasing me, she seated herself upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the many stumps that dotted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing. She had finished lightly, yet her</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude was one of tenseness. I noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that her hands were tightly clasped as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped down beside her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now we will start all over again, Jean,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she began. "You wish to marry me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As I have said."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you love me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">62	NEV1L G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you have not told me so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why should I, when you know it so</seg><seg type="columnLine">well?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True," muttered Toinette, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause that followed she relaxed, unclasping</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" I urged, after I had waited,</seg><seg type="columnLine">plucking at the grass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Coming to herself with a little start,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette threw out her hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"But how can we, Jean?" she demanded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is something to dream of, that is all."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here was complexity with a vengeance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brief though it was, I had been unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">solve Toinette's reverie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean--" I began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jean, Jean," she interrupted. "Can you</seg><seg type="columnLine">not see? Have you not thought? Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine that there is nothing to all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">save your question and my answer? There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are a dozen things that make it impossible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why, I am not even out of the convent."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had thought of that," said I. "I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then there is my teaching."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That also can be arranged."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And your cane, Jean. What of that?</seg><seg type="columnLine">You have just started, and you are doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. How would it be with a wife?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This obstacle I paused to consider, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">it bulked far larger in my eyes than In</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of Toinette herself. How, indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would it be with a wife? If I were to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">on as I had planned, each penny that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could scrape and save must go toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crop. I would be hard put to it to look out</seg><seg type="columnLine">for myself. And what if I had poor luck?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cane is tricky. With a bad year I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily find myself in debt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fact that I had overlooked this only</seg><seg type="columnLine">rendered my position the harder. To my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shame was added a feeling of helplessness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here I was insisting upon Toinette's marry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me, when I was not even sure that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could support a wife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Evidently Toinette was more proficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">than myself in the matter of solving</seg><seg type="columnLine">reveries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," she observed. "We must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">free for a while. Otherwise we can not go</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. We have our chance, Jean, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">must make the most of it. We must not</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of marrying now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This seemed true enough. Following</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette's reasoning, I found that I had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular desire for an immediate marriage</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HENSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">myself. All my thoughts and hopes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed upon my plans for the future. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were realized, it would, he time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of settling down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are right, Toinette," I agreed. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone too fast. But I was worried, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette accepted this with a smile, half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising from her stump. It was only too</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain that for her the discussion was ended.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bien, Jean," said she. "Yet you worried</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for nothing. Those boys-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She broke off abruptly, realizing her mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take, but already it was too late. With her</seg><seg type="columnLine">words had returned the trials of that Sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer to drive all thoughts of prudence from</seg><seg type="columnLine">njy mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What was my cane compared to the tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the Summer to come? With</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette free of the convent it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse than ever. There would be no peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me, no rest. Always I would be think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of what the little doctor had said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was too much. I could not stand it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We must marry and take our chance. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet, even as I sprang to my feet, my mood</seg><seg type="columnLine">held far less of jealousy than of final ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">asperation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait," began Toinette, but her words</seg><seg type="columnLine">were lost in the violence of my outburst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," I cried. "I can not wait. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must settle this here and now. Either you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will marry me or refuse me. There is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In what followed, Toinette acted with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftness that told of impulse rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. Indeed, I was hardly conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she had risen, before her hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon my shoulders again". This time they</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped me fiercely, while in the eyes up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to mine was a look of quiet purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as I had not seen there before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Jean," said she. "There is a way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even though we should not marry and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can not wait, there is still this way, if only</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can trust me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There could be but one answer to this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Trust you?" I echoed. "If I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust you, whom else can I trust?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So," said Toinette.

Indeed, when I considered Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide's inevitable opinion of our agree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, my sensations were rather those of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">naughty boy than of an accepted suitor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," I consented hastily. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can count upon me to say nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After this there fell rather an awkward</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence which lasted more or less through-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out our return to the settlement. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment there seemed nothing to talk about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Having exhausted the present, we had ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived at a future far too indefinite to be of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any particular interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aside from this I was in no mood for</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech. Just then I was experiencing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazed confusion of one who has revolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly in a mental circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toinette had been too quick for me. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly had she passed from one phase of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the affair to another that I was still rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertain as to what had actually occurred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt that, if left to myself, it would all</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually straighten itself out in my mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore I was only too glad when, upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching the house, Madame Alcide de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared that we had walked half the night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and promptly hurried us off to bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later in the privacy of my room, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieced together the events of the evening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The result, while promising a satisfactory</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusion, was far from gratifying. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, I could only feel that, considered as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a proposal, my effort had proved a pitiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">failure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not only did it lack the joy and ardor</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded by such an occasion. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">even devoid of the usual pleasant aftercon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequences of announcement and congrat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In my musings of the afternoon I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent some time in considering how I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">best break the news to Bois Berard. Now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be no news to break. Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sieur Bonnemaison would not pound me</seg><seg type="columnLine">jovially upon the back. The little doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not shake me gravely by the hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, worst of all, I was denied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure of sending Latour and his friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">about their business. True, I was now as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sured that their efforts were useless, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">this mattered little when they did not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">it themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When at last I dropped off to sleep, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was with a most uncomfortable sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">defeat.

This she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused, declining even to discuss the matter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was all settled, she declared. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no need to go into it again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throughout this brief interview Toinette</seg><seg type="columnLine">was both gentle and patient, but she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">also very firm. Afterward she kept me at</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm's length, merely replying with a smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a shrug to my frequent demands as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether we were really betrothed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I will never forget those few remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks of Toinette's vacation. In their un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainty and bewilderment they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse even than the ones that had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. It was almost a relief when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally ended and Toinette drove back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the convent again. I missed her, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her departure I managed to regain some</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of my peace of mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the Fall to turn my thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the all-important matter of grinding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MONSIEUR BONNEMAISON REVEALS HIMSELF</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT year the taking off of the crop</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied my entire attention. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a splendid crop, if not quite the equal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my first one, and, thanks to the increase</seg><seg type="columnLine">of acreage, it promised an excellent profit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As a consequence Monsieur Bonnemaison</seg><seg type="columnLine">was little inclined to take any risks in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of its disposal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must be with it from the cutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the first stalk to the weighing of the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">cart, Jean," said he.

Once we have done so, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">success is assured."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was significant that Monsieur Bonne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maison spoke in the plural. However, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had declared his attitude some time before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All through the Summer he had been about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field, watching the crop with an ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasing interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In addition he had discussed the growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cane with all of the enthusiasm that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had formerly bestowed upon his cherished</seg><seg type="columnLine">politics. In brief, Monsieur Bonnemaison</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been quietly fitting himself for the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fession of agriculture. His "our success"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was merely his way of informing me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had now reached a stage where he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">justified in sharing our joint responsibility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His offer of assistance I accepted eagerly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had hoped for it, nor indeed could I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done very well without it. In the art of</seg><seg type="columnLine">managing men Monsieur Bonnemaison was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a master. During the trials of the Spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had proved this upon more than one</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thank you, m'sieu," said I. "It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">good of you, especially your offer to help.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But what of the store?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can leave that to Poussard,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered Monsieur Bonnemaison. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary I will find him a clerk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused as if in thought, while his</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile took on a touch of whimsicality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is curious about the store," he added.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It was once my world. Beyond it and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">home I had nothing in view. But that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I had looked about me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus Doctor Poussard achieved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventh heaven of being left wholly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge. It was a tremendous event for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and his pride was only equaled by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of responsibility. However, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had conducted the business alone through-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the greater part of the Summer, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">position was little changed save for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">generous increase that Monsieur Bonne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maison saw fit to make in his wages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This arrangement, although highly sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isfactory to the little doctor and myself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed me in what I conceived to be an</seg><seg type="columnLine">irregular position. Now that I had aban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doned my work at the store, I could hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">consider myself in Monsieur Bonnemaison's</seg><seg type="columnLine">employment. As a consequence I felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was no longer entitled to my former pay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Monsieur Bonnemaison, however, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">short work of this fine-spun theory. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his employment, he declared. He had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not dismissed me, and until he did so, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was under his orders. If he chose to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in the field instead of the store, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his affair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was true as far as it went, but be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing young and disposed to take a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand in the matter,.* I accused Monsieur</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bonnemaison of padding his pay-roll in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to gratify his generosity. Thereupon</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ceased his blustering and for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time allowed me a glimpse of the far-seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrewdness that lay forever ambushed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind his smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you blind, Jean?" he chided me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Must I show you everything? But then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was blind myself. Like you I stuck in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one place. My eyes were opened only</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the politics, the talk outside."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused, checked by his usual cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and when he went on, it was with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">restraint that only lessened before his ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasing interest. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You spoke of the store," he continued.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"As I have said, it was once my world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now compare it with this new world of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine, a world of cane reaching from here</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the refineries of St. Pierre. You may</seg><seg type="columnLine">think this too much, but I tell you that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will come. Also it will not be in one great</seg><seg type="columnLine">plantation or a dozen but in a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered farms."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He broke off, and one of his short arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out as if to point a vision actually be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see, Jean? You see?" he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw, but it was not the vision of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams. Always they had shown me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad acres of the planter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is something to think of, but it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">also be something to manage, m'sieu," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">I. "How will you see after a hundred scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered farms?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before replying, Monsieur Bonnemaison</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at me as if to make sure that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not joking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dieu, Jean," he exclaimed. "You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinder than I thought. Can you see</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but your crop? It is not the cane</seg><seg type="columnLine">or even the farms. They are nothing. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the land that counts, those acres out</seg><seg type="columnLine">there that have been good only for cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">to walk over. What will they be worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we have proved that they can make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best of cane?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw now. but dimly.

Even now</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am not sure of my own acreage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With his words came a new conception,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a conception so fabulous that I almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared to put it to the test of speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, m'sieuI faltered.

"Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">madame will be rich some day, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">through you. At first I was like yourself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw only the cane. Then I began to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. After your first year I was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure. Now I know. It may take time, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will come. Good land is good land. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have only to make folk see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he finished, Monsieur Bonnemaison's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face flushed suddenly crimson. At the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought this the result of his vehemence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now I know that he had just begun to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize the extent to which he had revealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. Yet it was proof of his fondness</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me that, having done so, he allowed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remain in his confidence. In all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed his attitude was that of the part-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner rather than of the employer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just now, however, he returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter role.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bien, Jean," said he bruskly. "Let us</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no more talk of unearned pay. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing for my greatest stake and you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">my best card. You will do well to remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following Monsieur Bonnemaison's dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closure I attacked my work with an eager-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness that was tempered by an acute sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of responsibility. It was now no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">a question of my future, but of Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide's. If I failed, I could start again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For her it was the last chance of prosperity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like Lafitte, Alcide Berard had left his</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure underground.

Repayment, even of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest, would be a supreme satisfac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although no mention had been made of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter, I knew that my work at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">store was definitely ended. Next year we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would again increase our acreage, and al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready my employer was considering a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme of small separate crops to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked upon the tenant-system.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This meant a heavy increase of duty, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monsieur Bonnemaison, although wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">admirable as an executive, was of little use</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the field. It was plain that I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, and perhaps more, than I would well</seg><seg type="columnLine">attend to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Evidently Monsieur Bonnemaison was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not without an appreciation of the task</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of me, for soon after our talk he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent word to the field one afternoon that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must see me immediately at the store.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Upon arriving there, I found him busily</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged in inspecting a bunch of ponies</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been driven in by a rider from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prairie. They were small wiry ponies</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a type frankly Cajun, yet even to my un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained eyes they showed the results of care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful breeding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" questioned Monsieur Bonnemai-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. "What do you think of them?

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses of Cyprien Lalandre, the patriarch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the prairie, were in a class by themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are beauties, all of them, m'sieu,''</seg><seg type="columnLine">said I enthusiastically. "Any choice will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a wise one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True," agreed Monsieur Bonnemaison.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yet there must always be a preference.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come, Jean, what do you say?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus questioned, I considered the ponies</seg><seg type="columnLine">until finally I decided upon a tough little</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorrel with markings of white about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and forelegs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bien," said Monsieur Bonnemaison, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">called the rider into the store, from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he presently emerged to tie the sorrel to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rack in front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is Rouge," he announced before</seg><seg type="columnLine">trotting away with his remaining charges.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only waiting for him to start, I prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow his example.

True,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was often uncertain of temper. True</seg><seg type="columnLine">also that despite every effort he remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbroken to harness. These deficiences</seg><seg type="columnLine">were but the proof of his breeding. With-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out them he would not have been a Cajun</seg><seg type="columnLine">pony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the rest, he lacked no single virtue</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his kind. He was swift, he was willing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his gaits lacked the usual pounding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In addition he seemed tireless. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road be long and the going heavy, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">last mile was ever like his first one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the first flush of my gratitude I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had determined to abolish the rather ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vious Rouge in favor of the given name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my employer. But this Monsieur Bonne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maison refused to allow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you can not do it," he objected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He is already named. He is Rouge just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he is a horse. It is impossible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly Rouge retained his original</seg><seg type="columnLine">litle, nor in afterdays did I greatly regret</seg><seg type="columnLine">this arrangement. For, being blissfully ig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">norant of a sardonic future, Monsieur</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bonnemaison's parents had seen fit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">christen him "Narcisse." -</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thanks to my employer's foresight, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">now found little difficulty in looking after</seg><seg type="columnLine">our crop. Mounted upon Rouge, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an easy matter to follow the work in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of the field. Yet with the arrival of</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinding I soon saw that it would be im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible for me to accompany the carts to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island. For us it was a large crop, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the labor was uncertain. Only through</seg><seg type="columnLine">constant supervision could I be certain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cutting and loading.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly we decided upon a division</seg><seg type="columnLine">of labor. I would keep to the field and take</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the crop. Joe Vital, promoted now to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the position of head teamster, would attend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its hauling. At the island Monsieur</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bonnemaison would look after the weights'</seg><seg type="columnLine">and prices and the various other matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">pertaining to its disposal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  These latter duties were of a sort to ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peal directly to the genius of Monsieur</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Bonnemaison. From the first he evidenced</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wholly unconcealed delight in them. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning he drove off with the first of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carts.' Each afternoon he stopped at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field to report the day's proceedings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is the best of all, this cane," he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaim enthusiastically. "It is making a</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man of me. I can not understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">how I spent all those years behind my</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of the general he spoke often, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two had found a meeting-ground in the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussion of cane and politics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "He is a sharp one, M'sieu the General,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monsieur Bonnemaison would declare. "As</seg><seg type="columnLine">a planter he is an expert, and he has also</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me some things about the police jury</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which I had never so much as dreamed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am only waiting for the next meeting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Believe me, there are one or two members</seg><seg type="columnLine">who have a surprize in store for them."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he would add as often as not:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"M'sieu the General is pleased with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort. He says that we have done well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself in particular! Indeed, he has more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than once inquired about you. This means</seg><seg type="columnLine">something, Jean. The good-will of such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man will go far to help us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, when the crop was oft' and grind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over, he became more explicit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are lucky, Jean," said he one day</seg><seg type="columnLine">when talking of the island. "M'sieu the</seg><seg type="columnLine">General seems to have taken a real interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in you. Now that I think of it, he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked everything about you. Not all at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, of course, but from time to time. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">R OMANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN XROUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">is only since.I have considered his ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions together that I have realized their</seg><seg type="columnLine">completeness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This should have given me something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of, but at the time 1 was absorbed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our plans for the coming year. Again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prairie-crop had proved a success, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monsieur Bonnemaison was preparing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">branch out in a truly startling manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not only had he decided to plant the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last possible acre on his own account. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was already arranging a number of small</seg><seg type="columnLine">crops upon his proposed tenant-system.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this meant a tonnage of cane beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the capacity of the general's antiquated</seg><seg type="columnLine">mill. On the other hand, the long haul to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the refineries of St. Pierre would prove pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hibitive. Monsic-ur Bonnemaison, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed little annoyed by the difficulties of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait and see," he had replied, when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed them out to him. "Is there not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad on the prairie, and am I not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">member of the police jury? All I ask is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you grow the cane, Jean. I will guar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">antee that it gets to the mill."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly I had found no lack of work</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the end of grinding. From dawn to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark I was in the saddle, arranging the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails of this sudden expansion. Many acres</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the prairie must be examined with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes to cultivation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also there was the fresh accumulation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">teams and carts and implements. For these</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went to St. Pierre, so that I soon became</seg><seg type="columnLine">a familiar figure upon the streets of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And there one day I ran across Le Bossu,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing him for the first time since his visit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the woods. We met upon the street, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little man's delight and satisfaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">were only equaled by my own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jean, Jean," he cried as he gripped me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So we have come together at last. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">along we have been dodging each other like</seg><seg type="columnLine">boats in a fog. And now we will have some</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee, and you will tell me all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette and yourself. Dieu! It warms</seg><seg type="columnLine">mv heart to be with you again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We sat long over the coffee-cups while I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave Le Bossu my news, telling him of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had occurred save my betrothal. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, in my joy of seeing him, I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">confided as well, had it not been for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise to Toinette.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterward the little man spoke briefly of</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. He had enjoyed the swamp. In-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, once he had become accustomed to it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had found it hard to leave. Since get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting back, it had been the usual thing, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">just now he was outfitting for an expedition</seg><seg type="columnLine">to White Lake. Yes, it was far, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be expected. One had to travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">these days for good skins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time Le Bossu's farewell was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">comforting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-by for a little while, Jean," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">he at parting. "With the end of the sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son I will be back again. And you say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Toinette leaves the convent this year?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bien! You may tell her that despite my</seg><seg type="columnLine">neglect she will see me then."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus with these various distractions I</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid scant heed to Monsieur Bonnemaison's</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk of the general. If my grandfather had</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed a sudden interest in me, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no affair of mine. Our relationship had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been definitely established upon the occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of our first meeting. Five minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">after Monsieur Bonnemaison had spoken to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, his words were completely forgotten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a consequence, I was wholly unpre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared for an event that occurred near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of Winter. Riding into St. Pierre one</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning upon a matter of business, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed a note by Monsieur Gajan, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealer from whom I bought my implements.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of the source of the note Monsieur Gajan</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew nothing. He could only say that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been left at his place for delivery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having read the note, which requested</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I call at once on Judge Cestia upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of importance, I had still no sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picion. For, as St. Pierre's leading lawyer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Judge Cestia had more than once looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the interests of Monsieur Bonnemai-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Setting out in answer to his summons, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided that it merely concerned some</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh ramification upon the part of my em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ployer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AN INTERVIEW WITH JUDGE CESTIA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS BECAME one of his position, Judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cestia occupied the entire lower floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a small brick building near the court-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house.

If you wish my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">reasons-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The judge held up his hand.

"What more can</seg><seg type="columnLine">you ask? You are after cane, and what do</seg><seg type="columnLine">I offer you? Only a place at the top upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">land which you yourself declare to be of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best. In addition you acquire a name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a position unequaled in this parish."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Opening a drawer of his desk, he drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it a sheet of paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may see for yourself," he added,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he held it out to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taking the paper, I read its few lines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">precise penmanship which announced that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain unnamed testator bequeathed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">devised his entire estate to his grandson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Marsh.

For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest, you hold your future there in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your hand. You are lucky, my friend. Few</seg><seg type="columnLine">are offered such a chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He broke off, leaving me to' the fascina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the will. And well might he do so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">since it held for me the most tantilizing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">prizes. I could see those broad, fertile</seg><seg type="columnLine">acres sloping down to the old-fashioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">mill. They were unequaled. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideal. All along they had stood for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of achievement.

"He has been very</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," agreed the judge.

This may come, but if it does, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not be a planter. You will merely find</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself Bonnemaison's overseer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was true--so true, in fact, that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">served to confirm certain doubts of my own.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ever since the day when Monsieur Bonne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maison had disclosed his plans, I had con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered them with growing uncertainty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was for cane. Monsieur Bonnemaison</seg><seg type="columnLine">was for the land.

Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">I woufd have the choice of becoming his</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager or overseer or of going ahead by</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would be hard to keep on alone. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I. had tried it, 1 knew. Without back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a single year might finish me.

At</seg><seg type="columnLine">best it would take a long time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again I looked down at the paper in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.

Nay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more--it could be Toinette's as well.

I wondered at the presump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that had caused me to hold out against</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I thought of the future, of my be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trothal, of the long, harassed period of wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that was inevitable if I kept on alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Bois Berard. I pictured Latour and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow callers. I recalled the uncertainties</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that past vacation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One word, and all this would be forever</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind me. Established at Marsh Island,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could marry Toinette as soon as her</seg><seg type="columnLine">studies were oyer. We could begin our</seg><seg type="columnLine">future together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Rising, I laid the paper upon the judge's</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">desk very much as if it had been some doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ument of surrender.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bien, m'sieu," said I.

"Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">we may consider the matter as settled. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">for your going to your grandfather, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner the better.

"General Marsh would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand.

Once you leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods, you are done with them forever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You must consider your new life and forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old one. The two will not mix. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">can not be done."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To my ignorance this seemed reasonable</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough.

"You are right, M'sieu.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One can not work for two people at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The judge shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pardon, monsieur," said he patiently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but you do not see. It is not only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work.

When</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you go to Marsh Island, you must break</seg><seg type="columnLine">these ties.

It was still too much.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Alcide, Monsieur Bonnemaison,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little doctor, give them all up? No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was ridiculous. There must be some</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I thought of another and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">my tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Toinette?" I demanded. "What of her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">m'sieu?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The judge spread out his hands. Evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently as in all else he had been fully in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed about Toinette.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What can I say, monsieur?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered. "You must see for yourself that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is inevitable. Your positions will not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we are betrothed," I cried, forget-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting all caution. "It was for her as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as for myself that I accepted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With my words the judge was out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. It was the "betrothed" that moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, bringing him to his feet as swiftly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as unexpectedly as if he had been propelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by some hidden spring. One look he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">me of surprize, of consternation, of polite</seg><seg type="columnLine">but unmistakable injury. Then, wheeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, he fell nervously to pacing the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So, so," he muttered to himself, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning back to me again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, monsieur," said he sternly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is serious. You should have told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it at first. As it is, you must arrange</seg><seg type="columnLine">the affair yourself or at best with such aid</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I can give you. General Marsh must</seg><seg type="columnLine">know nothing of it. It might ruin your</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance entirely."</seg><seg type="columnLine">72	NEVIL G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Recovering himself, he added in his pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cise, legal tone:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now let us get at the facts. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have announced this betrothal? You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">made any mention of it in writing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though my temper was rising, I an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered him quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, m'sieu," said I. "There has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">no announcement. The affair is strictly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween ourselves, and I had no right to men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion it. Having done so, I can only count</seg><seg type="columnLine">on your discretion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The judge drew a quick breath of relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good, very good," he exclaimed.

With</seg><seg type="columnLine">no proof there can he no afterconse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quences."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I heard him, my anger changed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden disgust. All at once I was sick of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole affair. I thought of Toinette and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew hot with shame. Then came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of my father to bring back my</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger again. So this was what they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried on him. And now they were trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">it on me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The judge had begun to speak, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped him abruptly. I felt that the sooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was over, the better it would be for both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold, m'sieu," said I. "You have said</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. If I have been dull, I am sorry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but we are not used to such things in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods. There a promise is a promise, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have given mine and would not break it</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all the cane that has ever been grown.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the rest, I can only ask you again to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep this matter to yourself. It will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to tell the general that I have re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bowing stiffly, the judge resumed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. He was beaten, perhaps, but he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not show it. Indeed, there was that about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as he closed the interview which sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested victory rather than defeat. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like one who, having encountered an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected reverse, is upheld by the cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty of ultimate success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is final?" he questioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is, m'sieu."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will not have another chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not wish one, m'sieu."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reaching out, he touched a bell upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I must bid you good morning,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he, and a moment later I had fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed his clerk through the sound-proof</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HENSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus, as they had begun, Judge Cestia's</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts ended in failure.

Gradually I</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered that, in his efforts to ensnare me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the judge had succeeded in setting me free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For at last I realized the true meaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those acres at Marsh Island. At last 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that in some vague, half-conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">way I had made them my goal. All along</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had tempted me.

Had not Le Bossu said that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were waiting for me? Had he not declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night beneath the stars that I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have my chance at them some day? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little man had been right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In its own good time the long arm of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general had reached out for me to dangle</seg><seg type="columnLine">this wondrous bribe before my eager eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a space I had been caught and held,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in the end I had won free. Having</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered its all to no purpose, the arm would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not reach out again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was over, and no longer could I quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rel with my lot. I was free, wholly free,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to finish the work that I had begun. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might not be a planter, but at least I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow the way that I had chosen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thought of this brought peace, to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether with a new tenderness for my friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the woods. Somehow it was as if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been returned to me again. Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide, Monsieur Bonnemaison, the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor--in the weeks that followed I bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to me with fresh ties of love and ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preciation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for Toinette, I could only wait im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patiently for the day of her return. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed for her as I had never longed before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but beyond this was merely a sense of un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy confusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I only knew that, as upon that first</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christmas Eve at the camp. I had received</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lesson in values. On the one hand had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been Toinette. On the other all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breadth and fertility of Marsh Island.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I had made my choice without one</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterpang of regret. It was something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I struggled blindly with these half-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROMANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed thoughts and desires, groping my</seg><seg type="columnLine">way toward the light that was so soon to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I MAKE THE GREAT DISCOVERY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH the ending of Spring the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached for Toinette's gradua-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. To Bois Berard this was a memor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able event, since never before had the set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlement been represented at the convent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now Toinette had come forward; not with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mere term, but with four full years and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a diploma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> High and low the wood-folk were as</seg><seg type="columnLine">proudly elated as if they had played a</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal part in this achievement. -Had it</seg><seg type="columnLine">been possible, they would have attended</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exercises in a body. But the convent</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far away and was moreover wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded against such an onslaught. There-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the inhabitants turned to Madame Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cide with the gifts and good wishes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked their appreciation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Monsieur Bonnemaison, impressed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the religious atmosphere of the convent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and possibly confusing the occasion with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of a First Communion, sent a prayer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">book of ivory with a rosary to match.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doctor Poussard, viewing the affair with</seg><seg type="columnLine">more worldly eyes, had evidently been im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed by its educational aspect. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">offering, a writing-set in a gaily painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">box, was accompanied by a brief explana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had meant to send a book, he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his employer had forestalled him. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course a prayer-book was not exactly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">book, but then in a way it was one. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">all events it was something to read.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Madame Alcide, touched into</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence, had allowed this to pass unchal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenged by a single, "Come, Poussard!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In selecting my own gift, I had wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignored the demands of the occasion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wishing for .something that would suggest</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the joy of possession, I had finally de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided upon a small brooch. It was of gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">set with tiny pearls; and I felt sure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette's pleasure, since it would repre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent her first true ornament of value.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the humbler folk came simpler</seg><seg type="columnLine">tokens, a fan, a ribbon, a sacred picture or</seg><seg type="columnLine">image, each of them delivered with a word</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of praise and congratulation. Day by day</seg><seg type="columnLine">they kept coming until Madame Alcide de-'</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared with a choke in her voice that Achille</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never be able to bear such a burden</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the prairie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking on, I thought rather grimly of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my interview with Judge Cestia. So these</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the folk he would have had me spurn</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my high place upon the hilltop!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madame Alcide, of course, gave the grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uation dress, an intricate affair that was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result of a prolonged study of some half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen fashion-books. Each fold and ruffle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this all-important garment had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully worked out, although at the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old lady lacked the hardihood to at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt its actual creation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was too much for her, she said. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not depend upon herself to have it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">a la mode. There was but one thing to do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that was to invoke the assistance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her relatives at St. Pierre. She would go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her sister-in-law, Madame Octave, who,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all the Lavals, held first place with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">needle. She might be a little slow', but</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was time in such an emergency? Give</seg><seg type="columnLine">her a week, and she would produce a tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having arrived at this decision, Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide proceeded to arrange her plans with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thoroughness that was my chief comfort</seg><seg type="columnLine">during these periods of desertion. If it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to lose her, I at least had the satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faction of knowing exactly when she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be back again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can expect me on the tenth day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jean," said she. "There is the week for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dress and a day for the exercises. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">too bad that you can not see them, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be as uncomfortable for you as for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sisters. Afterward Toinette will wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">to spend her last night at the convent, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the custom. Then she must come for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day at Madame Octave's. Next morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">we wilLbe off as early as we can get away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following this announcement, Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide departed, leaving me to consider cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain plans of my own. Fortified by my</seg><seg type="columnLine">first and only visit to the convent, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">well content to miss the exercises, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not mean to miss Toinette. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to see her and to see her before</seg><seg type="columnLine">she left St. Pierre.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My reasons for this were the outcome of</seg><seg type="columnLine">long weeks of thought and anticipation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Always Toinette had returned a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">being, and her present homecoming was</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEVIL G. HENSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fraught with a particular importance. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">time she was coming back to stay, to es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tablish the relations that would endure until</seg><seg type="columnLine">we announced our betrothal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus I felt that I must see this new</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette amid the environment that was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponsible for her newness. Then, perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I might glean some hint of the future. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might even learn the meaning of much that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had puzzled me in the years before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thanks to Madame Alcide, I could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite in my arrangements. Toinette, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, would spend the ninth day at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Octave's. I had only to ride in on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that day and surprize her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To this Monsieur Bonnemaison agreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily enough, declaring that it would save</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the trouble of driving half-way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Davide's store. Some papers were to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">delivered, and I could leave them there on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my way home. At that hour Davide was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure to be in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly I set out upon the appointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning and rode directly to the home of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Octave, which, being upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prairie end of the town, was sparsely</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaded by a scatter of china-trees. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">house was of two stories, and, as I drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">up before it, I caught in one of the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows a brief glance of a girlish figure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Next moment it was gone, leaving me di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided between the regret of my discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the satisfaction of losing my final</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt. Toinette was in, and she had evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently hurried down to welcome me. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, however, my knock was answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Madame Alcide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Jean," she greeted me. "So you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not stand my being away this time?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or did Bonnemaison send you in?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Toinette?" I asked, my doubts return-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. "She is here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this the old lady smiled, although her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes held a sudden look of inquiry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," said she. "So it was not myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">or even Bonnemaison. Yes, Toinette is</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, and you will see her in a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But first you must meet Madame Octave."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Following her inside, I entered the par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lor, a room furnished in red plush, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung with heavy curtains to assist the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearted efforts of the china-trees. Here I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was introduced to stout, placid Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Octave, who blinked at me kindly through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy glasses to which she had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">doomed by her fine and incessant needle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterward I sat and listened to an ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count of the exercises, delivered in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main by Madame Alcide and in part by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Octave, who supplied innumerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">small details.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                                  •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was wonderful how much Madame Oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tave had observed. One would never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed the power of those eyes behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">their thick lenses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything had gone off well. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bishop himself had been present. And now</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a surprize. Toinette had been valedic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torian. Knowing it for weeks, she had kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">it secret until the very day itself. Think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. It was incredible!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To all this I replied politely, if briefly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes upon the door. I was glad that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette had been valedictorian, but I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not surprized. It was natural for her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead. Sh£ had always done so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And besides, I cared little for the exer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cises. I was there to see Toinette. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">was keeping her, I wondered. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she would never come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then all at once she was there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">framed in the shadows of the doorway with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suddenness of an apparition. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed all in soft, billowy white, and at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">look she sprang forward, reaching out eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jean, Jean," she cried. "This is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best of all. And if I kept you waiting, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that you might see me as I was yester-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. This is the dress, Jean. Is it not</seg><seg type="columnLine">lovely?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It must have been lovely, that gradua-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion-dress of fleecy muslin. I can not say.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Despite the painstaking care of Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Octave, I gave it not so much as a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance. My eyes were all for Toinette, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flush of her cheek, the light of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, the dark, burnished glory of her hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That she was beautiful I know, far, far</seg><seg type="columnLine">too beautiful for any words. And as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at her, I felt suddenly queer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dizzy, with a strange dryness about my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth that prevented me from uttering a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound. For one age-long moment I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">supremely happy. The next I was afraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps this is but a poor description of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my awakening. At all events it is a true</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. I can recall each sensation perfectly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can picture the scene, the proud look of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Alcide, the abrupt upward glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Madame Octave, the slim white figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Toinette poised smiling before me, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROUVE	75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of it vague and shadowy in the half-light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the curtained room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And this is how I came to love Toinette,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly, violently, for all the world as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meeting were our first one. The reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this I know no more than others in</seg><seg type="columnLine">like circumstances. Perhaps it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress, my weeks of longing. Who can say?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet I have always felt that despite our</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of companionship mine was true love</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first sight. It is said that love is blind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With me it was only through love that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were opened to the real Toinette, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette hitherto unguessed and unseen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Striving desperately, I finally forced my</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry throat to a word of greeting. Then 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to my chair, while Toinette, seat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing herself across from me, took up the tale</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her graduation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With her it was the gifts over which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as delighted as if they had arrived only</seg><seg type="columnLine">that morning. My brooch was the best.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She could never thank me for it. See, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it on. And the other things from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods! She wished for arms a mile long</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that tomorrow she might embrace all</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bois Berard in one great hug.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there was Le Bossu. Not only had</seg><seg type="columnLine">he kept his promise by coming to see her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he had brought with him a great bunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of yellowlegs as a remembrance from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marsh. Was not that like him? Yes, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as at the bridge now, where he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhauling his boat in preparation for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here was good news, and T declared that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would ride out to see the little man at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">first opportunity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This done, I listened absently, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette chattered on, helped out by her</seg><seg type="columnLine">aunts from time to time. Somehow I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not object to the presence of the aunts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just then I had no wish to have Toinette to</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself. I wanted to be alone, to take, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were, a mental stock of the situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed that my visit would never end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falling in love was a wholly strange and</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncomfortable experience. Such replies as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I made were confined to an occasional yes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no. My one wish was to get away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so, when I could stand it no longer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I arose, declaring that I must hurry off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were the papers for Davide, to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of certain commissions in St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pierre. Begging the aunts not to rise, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">bade them farewell. Then, followed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette, I made for the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside in the hall Toinette turned away</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach my hat from the rack. It was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old hat, a special favorite, yet from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment I disowned it. I must do better</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, I told myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Toinette spoke, the hat held high in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gesture of mock ceremony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have been so nice, Jean, that I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">crown you," she began. "And to-mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had faced about now to stare at me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hat swinging wildly from the sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop of her hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, Jean," she exclaimed in a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was almost a whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next moment her hands were in mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was crushing them, hat and all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Toinette! Toinette!" I gulped, unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to utter another word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Jean," said Toinette, and as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke, her eyes answered mine as truly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as fully as if they had cried their message</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Madame Alcide appeared, calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me from the parlor doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The flour, Jean," she directed. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">will see that there is enough? Remember,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will not be for one or two, but for three."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, madame," I replied, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was nothing for it but to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">good my haste of a while before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I departed, twisting about in my sad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle that I might see to the last the white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlit figure that waved to me from Mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ame Octave's front gallery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once out of sight I swung back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prairie, where I turned over all matters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">route and speed to Rouge, that I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">give myself entirely to the joy and wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had made the great discovery. I loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette. And, what was of infinitely more</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance, Toinette loved me. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be. no doubt of this. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">misreading the message of her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Love was curious, I decided. It was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly unexpected. There it had come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me like a flash, despite the years, despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the presence of the aunts. One would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have looked for it at such a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now at the time of my proposal-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I did not dwell upon this. I was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud of that proposal. Through it I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be forced to explain many things to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette. It was better to go back to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief parting in the hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so I went on throughout the after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">76	NEVIL G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">noon, leaving a sorely puzzled Rouge to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick his way across the short grass of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prairie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Near sunset I recalled .my commission</seg><seg type="columnLine">and set out in a definite direction. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">Davide's I delivered the papers, refusing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on account ol the hour the inevitable offer</seg><seg type="columnLine">of coffee. Then as I passed out to the store</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch, there came a tug at my coat, ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">companied by a voice that babbled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague entreaty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will help me, m'sieu?'' it droned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You will help me? I am no beggar. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had a place like this of my own."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The voice rose, sharpened to a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of hate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was M'sieu the General," it cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Always M'sieu the General. But it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">near, my settlement."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Davide swore impatiently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," said he. "He gets worse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one. His is no idle threat. He should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be restrained. He is not the fool that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he added, advancing upon the hud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dled figure:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get out Dugas, before I put you out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would you drive away my trade?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I in my new-found happiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped in between. Also I slipped a coin</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Monsieur Dugas' outthrust palm. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his evil I could not deny him. Had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">not played his unwilling part in bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to Toinette? Also he was terribly pun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished. As for his threats, they were ridicu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lous. What could he do against the gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The general and Monsieur Dugas! Back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the saddle, I dismissed these ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies with a confident smile. How I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared them! And now they were helpless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one denied by me in turn, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched by the hand of God.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the thought came a sense of tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umph. It seemed a fit ending for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">glorious afternoon. The general and Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sieur Dugas! Now indeed was I free of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. They had had.their day. Tomor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row was mine with Toinette.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XV</seg><seg type="columnLine">I COME TO JUDGMENT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEXT day, when I awoke at sunrise, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to a sense of gladness, very vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">and elusive like the first pale hints of dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HENSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">For a space I wa$ content to lie there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">steeped in a drowsy joy. It was enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that all was well with me. Why seek</seg><seg type="columnLine">for troublesome causes?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, as the light increased, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts took shape--bright, eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts, touched like the light with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden promise of midday. 'Toinette was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming. I would see her at noon. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">now she must be up and making ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus I began a seemingly endless day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though I added to my work the neglected</seg><seg type="columnLine">duties of the day before, the hours dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">interminably. Having started with Toi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nette in my thoughts, I continued by at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempting to follow her in her drive across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prairie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now she had left St. Pierre. Now, ages</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, she was crossing the big coulee. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, though she ought really to be in sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the woods, she was probably half-way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Davide's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But upon looking at my watch, I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">find that I was wrong. She could hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">have reached the coulee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it went throughout the morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, when my round was all but finished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an event occurred that robbed me of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatience. It was a runaway at a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant farm, the sudden bolting of a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken team. A cart was smashed, a horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cut, a man badly bruised and shaken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the applying of remedies, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing of the wreck, the calming of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited tenants. Once this was done, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was long past noon, and my problem was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer one of killing time but-of making</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet, when at last I raced back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlement, it was to find that the travelers</seg><seg type="columnLine">had barely arrived. As I swung in to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood-road, they were still plodding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last few. yards of their journey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hola!" I cried and dug in my spurs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing down upon the surrey from behind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, as I reached it, I stared aghast, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seat beside Madame Alcide was empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Toinette," I cried, all greetings forgot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten. "Where is Toinette, madame?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old lady did not at once reply, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was absorbed in making the turn into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her stableyard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait," said she, when this was accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plished. "I will tell you inside."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She spoke shortly, almost gruffly, drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping the reins and allowing Achille to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a stop of his own free will. And this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not Madame Alcide's way. Always she</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew up with a flourish accompanied by her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheery, "We have arrived."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slipping from the saddle, I helped her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground, where she stood in silence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for her parcels to be taken out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, madame?" I begged as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">piled them into her arms, but she only</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook her head before turning away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the unhitching that followed I made</seg><seg type="columnLine">record time. Indeed, I fairly tore the har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness from Achille's ancient frame, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I set off at a run for the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here I found no bustle and clatter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">homecoming as in. former days. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dining-room Madame Alcide was waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me, sitting rigidly erect in her accus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomed chair. She still wore her sunbonnet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and before her the parcels lay unopened</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down, Jean," she ordered as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had come in. "Certain things have hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened, and it is necessary that we consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She spoke quietly now, yet her voice held</seg><seg type="columnLine">a note of grimness that hinted at unpleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">things to come. When I seated myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the table, it was upon the extreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of my chair. Already I felt as if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on trial.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now to start," went on Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alcide. "We will begin with last Summer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She waited as if for some word from me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when this did not come, her voice rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sharp interrogation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why did you do it?" she demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not easy to reply. I had come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">judgment as I feared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then--then Toinette had told you?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">floundered. "You mean my, my pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posal?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Proposal!" echoed Madame Alcide, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her voice bit in like acid. "You call it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposal to say to a girl, 'I wish you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry me, but I do not know the reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">why?'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And Toinette did not tell me this, or at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least she did not think she did. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard enough to make her admit anything,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even after she knew that I knew. She is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you, Jean! I am surprized at you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To think of your doing this just when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was having her good time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am sorry, madame" said L. "I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it is not much to say so, but I am.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And I am sorrier still that you object so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much. I feared that you would."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I spoke with a sincerity that brought an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">instant reward. When Madame Alcide</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">went on it was in a kindlier tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Bien, Jean," said she. "If you say that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you are sorry, and I believe you, it is the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">best that you can do now. Also you make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">too much of my objections. It would have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been all right in time. I had hoped for it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">later on. But now, not knowing each other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and with Toinette in the convent! Why,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it was the one thing I feared, the one thing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that I fought against.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But I will tell you something. You re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">member that Winter when you asked me if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Toinette was beautiful? It was then that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I began to be afraid. I kept Toinette away</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the following Summer. It was not the les-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sons, as I said. It was you, Jean. And I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would have kept her away last Summer had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I not missed her so. I told myself that it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be all right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "So now, perhaps, you understand. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wanted it, but in proper time. You were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like brother and sister. It would not have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lasted a year."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There fell a silence, during which I con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sidered what Madame Alcide had said. All</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her thought and care made as nothing by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my blind impatience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But fortunately my mistake was not past</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mending. Though it was not easy, I has-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tened to set it aright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I understand, madame," said I. "Also,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">although I love Toinette truly now, I will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">follow your wish. It will be hard to wait,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yet if you say so-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "A moment," interrupted Madame Al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cide. "When I have finished, it will be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time for you to plan. We have only dealt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with thing number one. Now we come to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing number two which takes us back to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">your first days with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She paused, leaning forward, and added</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a voice of stern accusation:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Why did you hide behind a name then?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Why did you not tell me who you really</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was like the pointblank firing of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shot. For a space I could only gape at her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">foolishly. Now indeed had I come to judg-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">. ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "So you knew?" I finally managed to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No," answered Madame Alcide grimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That is just it; I did not know. Of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">7»</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">W E V I L G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HENSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw at first glance that you were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">marsh-rat. Otherwise you would not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">come into my home. And later with your</seg><seg type="columnLine">cane I saw clearer still. You wished to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a planter and you began as one. It opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'So,' I said to myself. 'The blood is</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than I thought.' I even hinted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to you that first day in the field.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the grandson of M'sieu the General!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was too much. How could I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you knew, Jean, and you did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me And why? That is what I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By now I had recovered some part of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">composure, yet I could find no defense for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my action. Viewed in the light of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Alcide had said, it seemed wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupid and useless. Why had I not told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her? Why had I not told all Bois Berard</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that matter, since the need for secrecy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been long past?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would have been the same anyway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Such things were bound to come out. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like me to see this now when it was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is hard to answer you, madame,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said I at last. I do not know why I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">this myself. At first it was necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have another name. I had run away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was scared. Afterward I kept on. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was habit, perhaps, I can not say. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not that I did not trust you. Had I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of it, I woujd have told you gladly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But there seemed no need."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this Madame Alcide laughed, a short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard laugh in which there was no trace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">merriment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No need?" she repeated. "So there</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed no need, Jean? Listen now to thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">number three. Yesterday within half an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour of your departure we had a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitor. It was Judge Cestia, and he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Toinette and myself. To us he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">your story, ending it with his offer of last</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winter--the offer that you refused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And afterward he made an appeal. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very polite, but he was also very plain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could do nothing with you. he said. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tried his best and he had failed. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not pleasant to say what he must say</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, but he had no choice. It all rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Toinette. Your grandfather needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, and Marsh Island was a very great</seg><seg type="columnLine">estate. If Toinette would only step</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She halted, as if in sudden distaste, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face flushed darkly beneath the shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sunbonnet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why say more?" she finished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Surely you can see, Jean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I did see through a dull haze of</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger such as I had never known, of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was almost afraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So that was it. Well might the old lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">be upset. And Judge Cestia! How he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricked using my confidence to shame the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones I loved. No wonder he had seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured in that moment of apparent defeat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even then, like some clever gambler, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had held and hidden this final card.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Toinette! Unconsciously I spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name aloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Toinette had gone back to the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent," answered Madame Alcide promptly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She will stay there until you are safe with</seg><seg type="columnLine">your grandfather."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again her words brought anger, but of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">different kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So," said I bitterly. "Then that is how</seg><seg type="columnLine">she cares for me. She says that she loves</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and she runs away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I would have gone on, but Madame Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cide turned upon me with the fierceness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter exasperation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bon Dieu," she cried. "Have you no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense at all, Jean? Do you imagine that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was easy for Toinette to go, for me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">send her? Suppose you were in her place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suppose you loved her as she loves you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Could you do anything else? Would there</seg><seg type="columnLine">be any other way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just the same I will find a way," I per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted. "I will ride in at once-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And to what purpose?" challenged</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Alcide. . "You will not see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette, and if you did, it would be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">use. She is not coming back. Even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">she tried to, I would not allow it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For the rest, this has been forced upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I have no choice in the matter. If,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you do not deny, you are giving up</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marsh Island for Toinette, what can I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">but prevent it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Madame--" I began, but the old lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid no heed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See," she went on. "I will be frank</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you. At first I was very angry. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was your betrothal, the hiding of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">name, and Judge Cestia's offer. I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you had deceived me, that you had</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed at me. But I wished to make sure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">79</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">That is why I took my time, questioning</seg><seg type="columnLine">you carefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now I believe that you meant no un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairness, that you were foolish, thoughtless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but nothing more. Yet the result is tha</seg><seg type="columnLine">same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '•And perhaps this is for the best. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are young, Jean; you do not know your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own mind. Also, as Judge Cestia said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marsh Island is a very great estate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have thought of all that," I put in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I have considered it carefully."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bien," agreed Madame Alcide. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">will let it pass then.

She could not help it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Women are like that.

"What is greater than love?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There is duty," answered Madame Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cide, "my duty to see that you do not make</seg><seg type="columnLine">this mistake, your duty to take that which</seg><seg type="columnLine">your father lost. Then there is your duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. So long as you stay here, so long</seg><seg type="columnLine">must Toinette keep away, and Toinette is</seg><seg type="columnLine">my niece. It is not easy to say this,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her voice broke and suddenly she rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her feet, coming around the table to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. A moment she stood gazing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me, and in her eyes was the same wistful</seg><seg type="columnLine">yearning that had marked my last day with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Therese.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is hard, Jean," said she slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"harder for me, perhaps, than for you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You are young with much before you. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am old and the wound will lake long to</seg><seg type="columnLine">heal. For I will miss you, Jean.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was foolish, yes, but I loved you for it as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ever will. And then there is what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been doing with Bonnemaison. It is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret, I know, but I am not blind. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">along it has been for me. And now--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you go-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Words failed her and she turned abrupt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, moving stiffly away to her room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she had gone, I sat for a long time</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring vacantly at the scarred surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table. Slowly the first shock of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger spent itself, allowing me to consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">my position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was snared, I was trapped, and in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own home. The very members of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">household had been turned against me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And all for a thoughtless omission, for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrecy born, perhaps, of my lonely child-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, it only meant that I must fight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was used to fighting.

But how?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madame Alcide I dismissed immediately.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no doubting the finality of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had said. Judge Cestia had hurt her</seg><seg type="columnLine">terribly, and to her pride was added her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of duty. It would never be said of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her that she had used her niece to despoil</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grandson of M'sieu the General.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toinette was still less promising. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that now. My anger cooled, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could even imagine her point of view. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">her life she had been used to sacrifice, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she believed that she stood in my way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What else could she do? And even were</seg><seg type="columnLine">it otherwise, she was helpless. Until she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was of age she must obey Madame Alcide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus,but one course was left open to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must take the war into the enemy's camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that enemy was my grandfather. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his cleverness, Judge Cestia did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">count. He was merely an agent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the thought cartie inspiration.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since the general had done this thing, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could also undo it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What if I went to him apd convinced him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I would never return? What if after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward he spoke to Madame Alcide? Surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">his word would be enough. Surely he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make her understand. Once she saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Toinette could not deprive me of</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that I had definitely refused, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be forced to give in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> •'Perhaps, with my knowledge of the gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral. it was'the sheerest madness.

I would have realized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">implied weakness of such an attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was a chance, and in the code of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woods chances called for action rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than thought. Also there was little time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I would see it through that day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Five minutes later I was pounding down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wood-road at a pace that would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">8o	NEViL G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> caused old Syprien Lalandre himself to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> stare in surprize.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GENERAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THANKS to my talks with Monsieur</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bonnemaison, I knew something of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the general's habits. It was his custom in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the late afternoon to go over the affairs of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his estate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Thus upon reaching the island, I did not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> keep on to his house. Dismounting half-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> way up the hill, I tied Rouge to a live oak</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and made my second descent upon the vine-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> covered office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   When I had knocked and been bidden to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> enter, I found the single room wholly un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> changed. There was the same film of dust,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the same, orderly litter, the same prim ar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> rangement of chairs, safe and table. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> general was seated as before, but this time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> he straightened up at once from the book</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of accounts over which he had been bend-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ing. There was something in the movement</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that hinted at eagerness, almost at satis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> faction, yet he spoke with his usual cold</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> precision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, John," he began. "Have you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">come to your senses at last?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I did not attempt to parley. Now that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was before him, I found that I must speak</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> out at once if I were to speak at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Yes, m'sieu," I replied. "I have come</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to my senses. That is why I am here to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ask you to make amends."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   At this the general stiffened, but he did</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> not lose his level tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "If you will be so kind, I should like to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> know exactly what you mean," said he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   There was something in his words that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> stung me to instant anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "I mean what you have had Judge Cestia</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> do--his going to my people, his driving</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> them away from me," I answered hotly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And for what? 1 am not coming back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You must understand this. No matter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'what happens, I will not come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The general did not reply to this at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time he merely stared at me as if I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> were some strange specimen about which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> he could not quite make up his mind. His</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tolerance was as unexpected as it was de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> moralizing. I had looked for anger, deri-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sion--anything save this calm appraisal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">H E N S 1-1 A W</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your people," he mused finally. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are a queer one, John. And your talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">about not coming back is equally as orig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inal. How could you come back when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have never been here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke without scorn or irony. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, his attitude was one of interest, mild</seg><seg type="columnLine">and half-amused. Having never known</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in this mood, I was utterly unprepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to deal with him. I could reply only by</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminding him that I had come to him once</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that he had sent me away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this his look of inquiry gave place to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of enlightenment. It was as if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">classified his specimen at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," said he. "So you have held this</seg><seg type="columnLine">against me all these years?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How could I do otherwise?" I retorted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment the general appeared to hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tate. The next he leaned forward as if in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden resolution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, John," said he. "Age brings</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisdom, and wisdom brings regrets. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps you feel that an explanation is due</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. At all events you shall have one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When you came to me, I was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">smarting from a half-healed wound. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of you reopened it. And so in a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of anger I sent you away. Afterward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I wanted you back, I found that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone. It took a long time to find you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In that time my interest waned. I am a</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy man with few opportunities for sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">timent. If you had stayed on the marsh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would probably have forgotten you en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely. You see 1 am being perfectly frank</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you came to the woods and put in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your cane, not with your hands, but from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saddle. That aroused my interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.

And at this moment he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a being far removed from the harsh auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crat of Marsh Island. He was merely a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonely pld man, worn and harassed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">years' disillusions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After that I determined to have you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he continued.

Now his movements were</seg><seg type="columnLine">informed with purpose--stark, deadly pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose that seemed fairly to cry itself aloud.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even before I caught sight of the weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand, I had divined his mission.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an ugly weapon--a squat, heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver of the sort known as bulldog. Also</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was at full-cock, the hammer poised and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready, like some waiting fang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But worst of all was its unspeakable age</seg><seg type="columnLine">and foulness. Though hidden, I knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">its bullets were green and rank with ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">digris. I had seen such bulldogs, such bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets, cast aside and forgotten in the gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shops of St. Pierre.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this I caught in Monsieur Dugas'</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief advance from door to table. Arriving</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, he raised his arm and brought down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bull-dog upon the tabletop. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">this very carefully and methodically, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were something that he had rehearsed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of times. Then he spoke, holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bulldog with a steady hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have come for my settlement, m'sieu,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His words held no threat or challenge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely the same dogged purpose that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked his approach. And having spoken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he waited with the calmness of perfect as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surance. Though bulldogs were notori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously inaccurate, he had placed himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the possibility of failure. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be no miss at that pointblank range.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Knowing this only too well, the general</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved not so much as a muscle. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated himself at the opening of the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">so that the bulldog now pointed directly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chest. With so broad a mark presented</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was useless to duck or dodge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, since Monsieur Dugas' finger was-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the trigger, there was no chance of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden spring. It was an impossible situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and the general accepted it with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignity, a composure beyond belief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet all the time he was fighting gamely</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the only weapons at his command.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once at a circus I had seen a trainer sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">due a refractory leopard. He had done so</seg><seg type="columnLine">without force or speech, solely by the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his gaze. And this was what the general</seg><seg type="columnLine">was doing, boring into Monsieur Dugas'</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow determination with eyes that were like</seg><seg type="columnLine">flecks of polished steel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I will never forget those eyes. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no fear in them, no uncertainty, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the calm, imperative force of a dominant</seg><seg type="columnLine">personality. Though the general spoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his words were superfluous. They seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely some trifling accompaniment to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady, merciless gaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put down your pistol, Dugas," he di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rected. "Put it down at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he added to me, without moving his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steady, John. You can do nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I marveled that Monsieur Dugas could</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand it, that his scattered wits should</seg><seg type="columnLine">allow his forthcoming reply. But then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lived only for this moment. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been plenty of time to prepare himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in those long, empty days upon the prairie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I will not put down my pistol,</seg><seg type="columnLine">m'sieu" he answered. "It was too hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get. I could not buy it. I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">take it. I had to break in after it like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thief. When I have had my settlement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yes. Until then, no. All along you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been after me. Now it is my turn."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He droned to a close, and the duel went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on again, the dreadful, silent duel be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween madness and indomitable reason. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was heart-breaking. It was unendurable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I fought down an impulse to rush in</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming. Why did not Monsieur Dugas</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot and end it? Yet how could he with</seg><seg type="columnLine">those eyes?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed an age before the change came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And even then it was very slight and subtle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a faint relaxation upon the part of Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sieur Dugas, sensed rather than seen. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders twitched, his hand trembled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">83</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps it was merely the natural reflex</seg><seg type="columnLine">from an intolerable strain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was enough for the general.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly, majestically he arose, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">never losing their clutch upon the mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give me that pistol, Dugas," he com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then it happened, the backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">start, the jerk of the finger, the sudden re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port sounding doubly thunderous in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smallness of the room. Yet I have never</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed that Monsieur Dugas fired inten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionally. Mad though he was, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have done so beneath that gaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That he was beaten I am sure. Only in</seg><seg type="columnLine">defeat, and in the confusion of surrender</seg><seg type="columnLine">did he accomplish his purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the crash of the bulldog I sprang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching out blindly to prevent a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot. But Monsieur Dugas was too quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me. In a flash he had twisted aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fire again. Then, dodging back with in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credible swiftness, he disappeared through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the half-opened door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At once I plunged after him, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general recalled me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let him go," he ordered. "They will</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch him soon enough."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so I turned back to him to find that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had collapsed into his chair. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">terribly gray and crumplkl. and one hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pressed tightly below the level of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are badly hurt, m'sieu?'' I ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am done for--shot through the mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle," he answered quietly. "And you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only then did I look down and realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had been hit. In the excitement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment I had felt 110 shock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Through the shoulder," I muttered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-fascinated by the slow welling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood. "I do not think that it is much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a space the general fought his agony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tormented eyes roaming restlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. Then, all at once, they came to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop, and his free hand rose weakly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">point to a corner of the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pay attention, John," said he. "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">is important. In the safe there you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">fino the original of the will that Cestia</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed you. It is all in order, just as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished it upon the day I determined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waited, panting, and went on:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was not for this, although I had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been warned. I did not expect it. I merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to secure you in case of accident."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But, m'sieu," I began, utterly over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelmed. "I can not--Toinette-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Live your life," he interrupted shortly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The will is unconditional."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waited again and added with a touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his old intolerance:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I had lived, it would have been dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent. I would never have given in, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you would have come here. You may rest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">assured of that. As it is-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice died out and he lay back, gasp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, his eyes fixed dully upon the tattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">flag above the mantel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Life is strange," he murmured. "I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Shiloh for thig."	•</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fell silent, and once more I tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak to him, uttering vague, stammered</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragments of protest, of uncertainty, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarce knew what. But he broke in at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, declaring that we understood each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, that it was all settled, that I was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marsh and he would expect me to be one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke harshly, impatiently; yet I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have always felt that at that moment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his fierce old way he was very near to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. At least he had said that we under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood each othar, and this meant much</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the general.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterward there was a strained, uncom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable pause which was broken by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of footsteps outside. At the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">they hesitated, and a young rr ■ atto peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertainly in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're all right, general?" he ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned. "It's mighty late, and they said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they was some shots-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He choked silent as his eyes became ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">customed to the smoke-laden twilight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh my Gawd!" he began on a rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream.	'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quiet, Paul," ordered the general. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am hurt, and so is (.his gentleman, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">grandson. It was Dugas. You get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name, Dugas. Send at once for the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and notify the sheriff. Then hurry back</seg><seg type="columnLine">with help."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It spoke well for the general's training</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Paul hesitated no longer. In an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant he was gone, shouting as he went.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of what followed I remember little. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">by now I had bled a great deal and my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">head was beginning to go round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus, when the footsteps returned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room became suddenly filled with ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROMANCE CZ5BPllBBp4s^^l3</seg><seg type="columnLine">84</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">N E V 1 L C.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">11 E N SHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cited servants, I could only try to lurch</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward in the general direction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. Then my feet went out from under</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and I fell through vast, swirling depths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blackness into merciful oblivion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTERWARD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTERWARD I was very ill. Of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general's death, which occurred that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, of his huge, stately funeral, of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">capture and confinement of Monsieur</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugas I knew nothing for many days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> True, I came to myself soon after being</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed from the office and insisted upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">being taken home to the woods. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor refused, giving me a draft that sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">me back into unconsciousness again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next day it was the same. I must not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even move about in bed, they told me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was the chance of fever, of infection.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must keep perfectly quiet until this</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger was past.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So I was forced to lie there, feeling very</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange and lonely in the great testered bed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which took me back to my father's room</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the days of the rue Bourbon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From my friends in the woods came mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sages of sympathy and assurance, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not see them. They were timid folk in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that great house and it was not for them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to disobey the doctor's command. Yet I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that if I did riot soon see a familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, I would go mad. It was bad enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to suffer as I was suffering now with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. It was too much to do so alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last in my extremity I thought of Le</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bossu. Toinette had said that he was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridge. Perhaps if I sent for him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would manage to come to me. At least he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would try, and when the little man tried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he seldom failed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the end, after much careful planning</seg><seg type="columnLine">and waiting, I sent out my summons by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paul, who, having been the general's body-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servant, was only too anxious to serve a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new master. And Le Bossu came, gaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance past my door in his own peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So, Jean," said he with his quiet smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then Dugas has been mistreating you</seg><seg type="columnLine">again? We must make the best of it as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">did before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Afterward he took charge, declaring that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he had not come to visit me but to nurse</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. And the doctor, observing the effi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciency of his methods, the effect of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence, allowed him to remain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thereupon he became a fixture at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedside, ruling me with a quiet insistence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was not to be denied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I must not move so much as a finger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was no mosquito-bite but a deep hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a chunk of lead at the end.' And a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirty chunk at that. If I squirmed about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dirt might be worse than the lead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His warning was justified when upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third day blood-poisoning set in. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">this for a long time I raved in ceaseless</seg><seg type="columnLine">delirium. In many ways it was like my</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickness at Bayou Portage. There was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same careful nursing by Le Bossu, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">-same frightful visions, even the same vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of a rescuing hand to draw me back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in moments of dire peril.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as before the hand was ever the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same, very cool and soft and caressing--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand of Toinette. It stayed me, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">comforted me, it made possible my final</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovery. But for it I could never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">resisted the dark malevolent tide that drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">me toward extinction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And yet, when at last I was myself again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and could look about me, there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toinette. It had been a dream after all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cruelly disappointed, I questioned Le</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bossu, who reassured me with promises</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the future. Toinette was all right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had sent me a thousand messages. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would see her as soon as I was well enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was not much, yet I clung to it, nurs-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my strength so that Toinette might the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner arrive. But when finally I was fit</seg><seg type="columnLine">for visitors, it was Madame Alcide who</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, very grave and tender and laden</seg><seg type="columnLine">with certain delicacies of which she knew I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fond. To my anxious questioning she</seg><seg type="columnLine">also replied evasively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Toinette was not well. She had worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">too hard. No, it was nothing to worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, but just now she must not risk a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long drive in the sun. Of course she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come as soon as she was able. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meantime I must be patient.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was poorly done, for Madame Alcide</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ill used to concealment. When she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone, I gave up. Toinette might come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it would not be the coming for which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I longed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That she did not care for me as I wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">was plain. That she was taking this means</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JtSROMANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">JEAN TROUVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">85</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of impressing me with the fact was plainer</seg><seg type="columnLine">still. Otherwise she would never have de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted me in my hour of need.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had I been well and wholly myself, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have sought other reasons. As it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, I became obsessed with the idea that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had lost Toinette, that without her the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future held nothing for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What if I owned Marsh Island? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">if, as Judge Cestia assured me, I was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only a planter, but the planter of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parish? All this meant nothing in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">present mood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for the judge, I gave him full charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my affairs until such time as I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">look after them myself. He was very kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and considerate, and with my sickness my</seg><seg type="columnLine">former hostility had vanished. After all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had merely served the interests of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his numerous clients.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the days that followed I saw no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Madame Alcide. Her visit had upset</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and it was thought best that she should</seg><seg type="columnLine">not return. But Monsieur Bonnemaison</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, driving out upon the first available</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunday with Doctor Poussard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was good to see them, to hear Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sieur Bonnemaison's glowing account of</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs. The crop was wonderful. Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he seen such a stand. I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hands full in grinding it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the rest, he had missed me terribly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first it had seemed impossible to go on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even now he felt the need of a partner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was considering Poussard. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">did I think of it? Himself for the cane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poussard for the store?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the little doctor, declaring that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too much, surveyed me with shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes while I voiced my approval of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">combination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, when I could go outside, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood-folk arrived. They came fearfully in</seg><seg type="columnLine">groups, tiptoeing upon the gallery to gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me in silent awe, as if I were some</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange exalted being upon whom they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for the first time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as I watched them, I understood</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Judge Cestia had been right and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had indeed gone up on the hill, far, far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from these former friends of mine. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might see them, greet them, speak with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, but they could no longer play a part</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my life. Even with Madame Alcide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monsieur Bonnemaison, the little doctor, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be much the same..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of them all there had been but one who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could have entered fully into this new life</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mine, and I had lost her. The loneliness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it was unspeakable. They were all gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">save Le Bossu, and soon I must lose him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More than once I had protested against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little man's kindness only to receive the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same reply. He had started this business;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he meant to finish it. When I was well</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, it would be time to think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I had kept him on beyond his period</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nursing, absolving my selfishness with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought of my necessity. For in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">final weeks of convalescence Le Bossu had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become more necessary to me than ever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was my confidant, my adviser and</seg><seg type="columnLine">above all my comforter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now that I was up and able to move</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, I felt that in fairness I could no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer keep him. He had had a long siege</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it and he was plainly hoVnesick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps he was tired, he admitted. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">although he had been very comfortable, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be nice to sleep beneath the stars</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Suppose he began by looking over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his boat and laying in supplies. Then, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything was all right, he would leave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly after three days of prepara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion Le Bossu came to me to say good-by.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All was in readiness and he would sail with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the afternoon tide. There was much that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had meant to tell him, yet at the last mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment I could only gulp out, "Bossu."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the little man understood, patting</seg><seg type="columnLine">me upon the shoulder in his old way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is all right, Jean," said he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What use are the lips when the heart is</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking? Only send for me if you need</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and I will be satisfied. I will always</seg><seg type="columnLine">be ready and waiting for your word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And" one thing more. Be a man. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have come to a high place, and many are</seg><seg type="columnLine">dependent upon you. Remember, it is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">your happiness but theirs that must count."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he left me alone with my duty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE HILLTOP</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT afternoon, when I could stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">my loneliness no longer, I had Paul</seg><seg type="columnLine">move a chair to the outer edge of the hill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">top. Here I seated myself beneath an oak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking out across the marsh toward a well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered bayou. It was too early for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my purpose--I must wait.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^---- ROMANCE ---^</seg><seg type="columnLine">r</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">80</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEVIL G HENSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In course of time a certain boat would</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass out along the bayou bound for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bay. From my lofty perch I could follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">it far, as it twisted its way to open water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps, when it was just below me, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might even glimpse a figure in the cock-pit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus I would see my last of Le Bossu ere</seg><seg type="columnLine">he returned to the old free life of the wild.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So I waited, my eyes fixed hungrily upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marsh, my back turned squarely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">those acres that were now my own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ah, to be free again, to roam these other</seg><seg type="columnLine">trackless acres, secure in the knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Toinette would be waiting for me at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door of the hut! That was living.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Perhaps it was all very childish and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasonable, yet there was some excuse for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I was young. I had been very ill, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my life seemed utterly empty. Thus, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last my head went down into my hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt little shame. It was weak, I knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but this was my darkest hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so I sat there, forsaken and hope-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, until from behind me there came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint swishing as of a skirt. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swishing changed to a rushing that ended</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a sudden thump beside my chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have come, Jean," said a voice, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I raised my head to look straight into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of Toinette.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  One searching glance I gave them before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I held out my arms. Yes, they were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes that I was looking for, the eyes that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had treasured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Toinette," I asked at length, "why did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you not come to me when I was so ill?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I was there, Jean," she answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I never left you_ a moment. Only when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were yourself again did I go away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So that rescuing hand had really been</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. I reached out and took hold of jt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then?" I went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And then I waited," said Toinette. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hard, Jean, for I loved you truly as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have always done. It almost broke my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. Yet what could I do? How else</seg><seg type="columnLine">would Tante' Aurore allow me to act?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You remember that day when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished me to marry you? All I asked was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one word of love, yet it was ,not yours to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give. True, when you left me that day in</seg><seg type="columnLine">St. Pierre, I thought that you loved me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but how could I know? You had gone up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">far up, where you might easily wish to for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">get me. And so, if I came to you and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not want me----"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her cheeks flamed, and now it was her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head that went down against my arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, Jean, can you not see?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleaded. "How could I do otherwise?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not wait to see. The past made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no difference. The future counted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now?" I questioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now we are sure, Tante Aurore and I,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she replied, '^ossu came to us and told</seg><seg type="columnLine">us this morning.

I was content to lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in my chait; and watch her, wrapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the peace that is born of perfect joy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus we were when at last Le Bossu's sail</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared winging its way into the vast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy heart of the marsh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Toinette spoke, very softly, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who utters a pleasant thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Papa Ton will be glad," said she.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I understood, for the little man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me that he would put in that night at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bayou Portage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon after this Toinette declared that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she must leave. It was late, and Achille</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very slow. Yes, she would be back</seg><seg type="columnLine">next day, bringing Tante Aurore. The old</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady could wait no longer to see me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides, there were certain proprieties to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be observed. Now that I was a great man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all eyes would be fixed upon me. •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So we rose and crossed the hilltop to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite side, where I stood for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing eagerly out in the direction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then we went down to where Toinette</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tied the surrey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of our parting I will say nothing, save</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was observed only by Achille.

And then when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black country succeeded the strings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamps and the stopping-places grew few,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he threw down his book and sprang to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time it was more than a sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">loneliness that oppressed him. A nasty</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancy had begun already to touch his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves and make them quiver, and now it</seg><seg type="columnLine">became intolerable. He was far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">timid; his nerves were usually under ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirable control, and his high spirit scorned</seg><seg type="columnLine">this intruding fancy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet more and more loudly a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to say to him--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is somebody else in this car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood still for a moment, wrestling</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the impulse, and then nothing could</seg><seg type="columnLine">withhold him from dropping on to his knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looking first under one seat and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the other. To make sure, he even</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his stick down from the rack and</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed it along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You fool!" he said to himself; yet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught himself breathing more easily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat down again and picked up his.</seg><seg type="columnLine">q8	J.

If so, could his own feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">be mere fancy?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stopped at a station, and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast sense of relief he-let down the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaned out. The clean night air</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to blow the disturbing fancy out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head, and when they started, he left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window down and let the wind whistle</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the carriage all the way to Gilswood</seg><seg type="columnLine">Junction. Uncomfortable he still remained,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet the fresh drafts of air seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tonic effect, as if the fancy were morbid</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its cause unclean and the pure wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the sea disinfected the carriage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The special feature of this evening train</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which Vincent had objected was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">change which its passengers had to make at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gilswood and the tedious wait of an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the connection for Chipping-Urby</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be caught.

He did not even conde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scend to rise on tiptoe, but with an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient movement tried to turn the vase</seg><seg type="columnLine">well above his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steady!" exclaimed the doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The vase was swaying already and before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could stride across the room the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened. Colonel Barlow just man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged to break its fall or it would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivered into a hundred fragments. As it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, it broke with a crash and lay in three</seg><seg type="columnLine">great pieces on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" said the colonel, and if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor did not say it, he thought it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And it was not the mere accident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">affected them. Recalling his feeling after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, it seemed to Dr. Anstruther--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel Barlow confessed to the same sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation--as if the nasty atmosphere of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">room had become concentrated a hundred-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fold. And then both men found themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing easily and even smiling at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other over the pieces of china.

And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he remarked on this, his friend agreed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they returned to the fire and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted their pipes and fell into their ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">customed leather chairs, their talk started</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightway on its familiar lines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll shoot the North Side on Friday,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">began the colonel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '"Lining that high hedge for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive as usual, I suppose?" said the doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN Dr. Anstruther left a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes after midnight, the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon was then low in the sky and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciably darker in the avenue. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpses of the park were dimmer, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows through which he walked were</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacker, and the air, it seemed to him, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown still closer. The doctor, in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon threw off his overcoat and strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">down toward the lodge-gates with his white</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt-front making a little light spot in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some reason his thoughts went back</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly and vividly to his old days in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain frontier station, when the tribes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were restless and sentries were being sniped</seg><seg type="columnLine">by daylight and suffered a still gorier fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">at night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DEVIL'S HOUSE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ioj</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A nice mark this shirt would make, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were a Pathan behind one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees," he thought; and then, to his an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noyance, he caught himself glancing sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piciously to the right and left in turn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even quickening his stride a trifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am growing senile," he said to himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the next instant stopped dead with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden contraction in the region of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dark figure was actually standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">within five paces of him, a figure that first</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to loom up to a gigantic height, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, as he kept his eyes hard and frown-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upon it, appeared to shrink to a lesser</seg><seg type="columnLine">stature than his own. Neither said a word,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he was conscious both of an intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutiny and of a swift return of that same</seg><seg type="columnLine">repellent sensation he had felt in the li-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll know me next time, my man,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rapped out in his harshest voice--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Anstruther's voice could be very for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">midable. "Who are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without a sound the figure slunk away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so swiftly that in another instant it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly vanished into the shadows, and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">so silently that he did not even hear a foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall. He strode to where he judged it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have stood and said to himself:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''The fellow must have been standing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grass, though I could have sworn he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nearer. Who the devil can it have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To give chase was so obviously futile</seg><seg type="columnLine">that after peering into the shadows for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute or two he resumed his walk down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the avenue. More and more slowly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">paced,, till, when he reached the lodge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gates, he stopped short for the space of</seg><seg type="columnLine">several minutes. The stranger had ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently been coming in the opposite direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and had certainly gone on toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall, and the more he reflected on this, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger grew the doctor's reluctance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave his friend's house unwatched and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To stand by the avenue and expose him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self seemed unlike the conduct of a thief;</seg><seg type="columnLine">still, it had been a suspicious incident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then the spirit of the old hunter</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided the matter. He put on his over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat again to hide his shirt-front, pulled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft hat down over his face and retraced</seg><seg type="columnLine">his steps, walking on the grass this time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the way up the avenue he saw not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glimpse of a living thing and heard not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a sound, though the night was so still that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breaking of the slightest twig would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been audible to his keen ears. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, as he drew near, was a dark mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbroken by a glimmer of light and to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearances quiet as the grave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Skirting the gravel, and all the while</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided between the fear of making himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">look foolish for his pains and an insistent</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunting sense that all was not well with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that house tonight, he passed round the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner and entered a flower-garden that lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the library windows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And there he stopped dead. Through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chink in the curtain he could see a ray of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light escaping from one of those windows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knowing his friend's habits to a nicety, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could count on the colonel's smoking one</seg><seg type="columnLine">last small pipe after his oWn departure and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then going off to bed. He had had time</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough by now to finish his pipe and be</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, and the light then meant he was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">later than usual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keeping on the grass, Dr. Anstruther</seg><seg type="columnLine">stole along till he was almost opposite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window, and then he stopped again abrupt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. He could see now that the window was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few inches down at the top, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead silence of that still, heavy night a</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmur of voices had reached him, faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">but unmistakable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Anstruther ought to have felt re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured. There were several possible solu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of the problem of who the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">person could be--the colonel's old soldier</seg><seg type="columnLine">butler, for instance, or the housekeeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a report of a servant ill. And it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">manifest that there were no high words or</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarreling. Yet, instead of reassurance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dreadful, nameless uneasiness seized upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor and kept him there with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles instinctively braced like an animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to spring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Faintly he heard the murmur of voices,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so faintly at that distance and through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtains that it was. impossible even to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">which party was speaking; yet the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the strangest fancy that he knew one</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the other by a curious feeling which</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to affect him when one spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was telling himself that this was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idlest freak of imagination, when he heard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">low but quite plainly, a laugh, and at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">--imagination or no imagination--his scalp</seg><seg type="columnLine">tingled and for the instant he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have moved even if he would.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dead and utter silence followed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">104</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">J.

An</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinct as strong as that which had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">him back seemed to tell him that the dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger had passed from the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It struck him then that if a stranger--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that figure in the avenue perchance--had</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the house and conversed with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend, he might see him emerge from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front door. And so he hastened out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden and round the corner of the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but though he stood under the shadows for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several minutes, he saw nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then it occurred to him that if there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a visitor. Colonel Barlow would most</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably have shown him out before ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguishing the library lights, and so he</seg><seg type="columnLine">set off again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must never let Barlow know I've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">spying on him," he said to himself, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that one of the few things his old</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend would find it hard to forgive was</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything like an attempt to surprize a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidence he had not given spontaneously</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. And, indeed, no man could feel a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger sympathy for this sensitive reti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cence than Dr. Anstruther, for his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentiments were precisely the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he went down the drive, he glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his watch and noticed that it was then</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter past eleven.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOME shooting-details to be arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">made Dr. Anstruther's excuse for</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking up to the hall next morning after</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast. Even from himself he tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceal the truth that he was devoured</seg><seg type="columnLine">with something between apprehension and</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity to learn what had happened last</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, for in his estimation curiosity was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulgar vice and apprehension a foolish</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even if he did not see through him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self as he hastened to Urby Hall at twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">his usual pace, he realized it quickly enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he found his old friend smoking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe in his library, apparently as imperturb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able as ever. The intense relief came</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost as a shock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet he had only been in the library a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of minutes when it became clear to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his watchful eye that the colonel's com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posure was not unlike his own--a veteran's</seg><seg type="columnLine">contempt for ruffled nerves.

She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had a figure like a horse shoe, a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pinched up little face devoid of even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rudimentary prettiness. Later one noticed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that she had large brown eyes, regular</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">white teeth, and extremely small feet. She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was tongue-tied of speech. But she could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dance like a dream, could thrum real music</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from a guitar, and she could sing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Charles Barnes and Eugene Rodin had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been invited to the baile at the alcalde's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">house, by the alcalde's son, Francisco,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whom they had met on the boat from Bal-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">boa. Francisco, "Pancho," or Frank Mar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tinez had just finished an education at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Columbia University and was proud to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">show off both his American friends and his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of English and was pleased to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">show the Americans his own people at their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">best. The average American may travel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all over Central and South America and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">never see the inside of a better class home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After the general hand-shaking and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">meeting the guests was over and the two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Americans had whirled through a few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dr.nces, Barnes noticed that the little Mo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rales girl certainly did not lack for partners</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and between dances men flocked around</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her. He made mention of this to Rodin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They both engaged waltzes with her and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when these were over agreed that she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could certainly dance but otherwise there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">didn't seem to be anything to her. How-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ever, the commotion the men raised over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her caused Rodin to call Frank Martinez</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aside and ask him concerning her.

It makes any American put his</seg><seg type="columnLine">best foot foremost to equal the manners</seg><seg type="columnLine">and breeding of the better class Latin</seg><seg type="columnLine">American. In Spanish, English, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">French, the conversation often touched on</seg><seg type="columnLine">topics not heard outside the most select</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing rooms in the United States. Wit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jest, banter, and sparkling bits of talk, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jrou-jrou of silken skirts, gleaming white</seg><seg type="columnLine">and olive shoulders, twirled mustaches, lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guid eyes that now and then spoke boldly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighs, jealousy, and all the rest of it, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wailing of the fiddles and the shrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">piping of the flutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And when the ball was over, the men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one and all, stampeded over to Conchita</seg><seg type="columnLine">and asked her to sing.

Some one brought a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandolin and she stepped quickly to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She began with a comic love song, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about a young fellow who always</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried a loaf of bread and munched on it</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he passed and repassed his sweet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart's door (played bear) so that her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother would not think he kept himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive by seeing her (solo por verte me man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tengo-o-o), sang a couple of ranchitas, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she sang her favorite. It was "Vida Mia."</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is a song that stirs the soul. It is an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old one written by some wandering trouba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dour back in Spain. It is a song of wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering and love unrequited. Soft, sibilant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lisping, now and then rising to the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes like the lute of a lonely shepherd, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrant contralto spread the veil of Queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mab over the sordid earth.

There is not a stone or brick build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the city, and even the cathedral is</seg><seg type="columnLine">built of split bamboo, due to the fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quency and violence of the earthquakes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is sixty miles up the Guayas River from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coast and the city is below the level</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the river at high tide. The natives of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guayaquil are mostly immunes but now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then a plague breaks out that slays a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter of the population in a few months.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is how it has earned its name of "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graveyard of South America." Few Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">icans and white Europeans remain longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to catch the next boat away. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who have been there and got away alive</seg><seg type="columnLine">boast of it ever afterward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the Summer of 1912 twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand people died of "Yellow Jack" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubonic and many more were slain in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamps just outside the city as they fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to hand battles with machetes; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a revolution was in progress. A series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthquakes came that caused the earth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll in waves like a stormy sea. Wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">shacks were toppled over and people lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EDGAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Y OU NG</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flat on their faces in the muddy streets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayed for mercy. The rains came and</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed thousands of bodies down the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">creeks and into the Guayas. Numerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpses floated up and down with the tide</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of Guayaquil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eugene Rodin and Charles Barnes re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained through it all. The last thing they</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to do was to leave. No matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the day brought, the cool of the eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning saw them either in the patio of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morales' home or at the home of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend where she had gone. Some of Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chita's suitors had died, some had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">slain in the revolution on one side or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, and some had lost heart from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruel competition waged by the two Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">icans and by Frank Martinez. One or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other, or all three of them, was with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her constantly. She sat hunched up in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair and held tongue-tied discourse with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and they bore with it. Later she</seg><seg type="columnLine">sang. Then there was no more sickness</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the earth, no earthquakes, no revolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. Nothing but love and kindness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conchita with a heart of gold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One night Conchita noticed a look pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">between Rodin and Barnes that was any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing but friendly. She had been at great</seg><seg type="columnLine">pains to treat them both equally well and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had often neglected Pancho to do so. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">night she cried when the three men had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone home. The friendship of the two had</seg><seg type="columnLine">appealed to her as something fine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">noble. It had been so unselfish. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been having a grand time and now it ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared that trouble was brewing. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman's intuition had sensed it even be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the men knew of its existence. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">vowed to see less of them in the future.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And she did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the less she saw of them, the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">jealous they became of each other, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more enamored of her. It had been a hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Summer and the nerves of the two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were raw. Also the tropical sun strikes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain hysteria into a stranger's brain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The normal loves and hates and desires are</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnified a hundred-fold. Cold-blooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists make mention of ultra-violet rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun. Herb Spencer would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">called attention to the nearness of the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive force that drives life on this planet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They all forget that plant life absorbs car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bon dioxide from the air and gives off pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen. People are living at white heat in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the tropics because they are drunk with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">superabundance of oxygen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An ill-timed jest caused one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Americans to move from the hotel and take</seg><seg type="columnLine">up residence at a native petition. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">this they passed each other on the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">without speaking. And then, separated</seg><seg type="columnLine">from each other, they began to hate as</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitterly as close friends do when they fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. By using Pancho as a mutual friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">they timed their visits so that they did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet at the Morales' home. Pancho had</seg><seg type="columnLine">decidedly the better of it for he came and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went when he chose, and he sympathized</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all three in turn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each of the Americans tried to pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">something bad from him that the other had</seg><seg type="columnLine">let slip. But he only had good words that</seg><seg type="columnLine">each had said about the other. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused both Barnes and Rodin inwardly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage for it appeared to each that the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">was trying to appear more gallant. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped that the other would forget and say</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiteful things and by this appear to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">less of a man in Conchita's eyes. Hate fed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on hate and jealousy fed on jealousy until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men were at dagger's drawn with only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a word needed to start real trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A BALL had been going on at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alcalde's house. Conchita had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused to dance with either American, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">had danced frequently with Pancho Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinez. At the finish she had been especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruel and had refused to sing and trotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with her aunt Juana with a curt nod</seg><seg type="columnLine">for both Barnes and Rodin. Each of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew in his heart that the other had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cause of her peculiar actions and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">raging. Pancho had gone in her wake, pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly to sing a serenade under her balcony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In filing out of the door some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramped on Barnes' foot.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">place was on the road to nowhere; it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous even to steamers because of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncharted reefs and fierce shifting tide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rips and currents; and to sailing-vessels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we had seen, it was deadly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROMANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE TERRIBLE ISLAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">i iq</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless some chance might send a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship in our way, and we could not afford</seg><seg type="columnLine">to neglect it.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up a couple of them and carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to Flower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lady Mary, Lady Mary, you mustn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait on me," he exclaimed, turning round</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his earnest gazing at the sea and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking the bottles from her hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thank you all the same." Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to awake. "Flow did you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wanted these?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sea lady stooped to tie her shoe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I, like a fool, came forward eagerly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it for her; and then I saw that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had bent down her head to hide her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She let me tighten the lace, the while</seg><seg type="columnLine">she stood up bravely with a telltale glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her usually pale cheeks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--just knew," was all she said.

What else could I do?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, I saw them together on the beach,</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy filling bottles with wide leaves on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Flower had written some message</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a thorn, and corking them up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">corks that any one of us could find for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gathering in the neighborhood of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave where the Greeks kept hidden all day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flower had wax, too, from the candle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nuts I had discovered, and smeared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corks well with it when they were driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">home. Then he and the sea lady lashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottles to little rafts of driftwood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stood watching for quite a while; I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not offer to help, for I knew they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would rather be left alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the sea lady's idea to put sails</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the tiny crafts that carried our hopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of freedom. She had been knotting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastening the fibers that secured the bottles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with true sailor skill--all the work of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hands was neat, finished and effec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive; there were no loose ends about Lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary--and by and by she took a sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliver of driftwood and began hammer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it into the little raft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me do that," said Flower.

"They are such</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty toys."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toys! when one came to think of it, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not have been more than five years</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so since she was playing with actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">toys, herself. And yet, she had three men</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I knew of, held in the hollow of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">flower-like hands, and how many, of whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not know?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What was it we all loved in the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady? I asked myself the question often</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough in those days. She was very,</seg><seg type="columnLine">very pretty, but it was not that. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was young, unmarked, unfurrowed in body</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mind as a lily or a bloomy peach.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it was not that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was as brave as Nelson, as gentle as</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own grandmother, and as brilliant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-helpful as probably her own grand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughters would be. But you do not love</seg><seg type="columnLine">a girl because she balances gracefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the generations, catching the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">set gold and the sunrise glow alike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Why did her world find the sea lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">irresistible? I might answer that question</seg><seg type="columnLine">now by asking another. But I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know the other in those days--not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I looked at our sea lady and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in her face and vaguely sensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in the pretty names we gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">her that seemed to point toward a solu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of puzzles unsolved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well! I gave it up for the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pleased myself by watching her. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had hammered the slip of wood home now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Flower had hammered one or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">others on one or two other rafts. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">they got the indispensable coconut can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vas. and made little sails out of it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">set them cunningly on the tiny masts, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the fairy ships would sail with any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing approaching to a. fair wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then they carried the fleet down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            ^ mrrn i.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">went surprizingly fast, tiny as they were.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We saw them make their way through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reefs, as if they had each a pilot aboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will any one ever find them, I wonder,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the sea lady, looking wistfully toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knew what she was longing--that she,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and perhaps another, were on the decks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fairy fleet, sailing away and away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Terrible Island. It seemed hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the little boats could go and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You know how it is when you write a</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter to one far away and wish and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish that you could slip yourself inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the envelope, to go with it whither it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going.

And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, so did I feel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fleet had better luck than the tree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal; but we did not rely on it over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">much. All this time, I need hardly say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Greeks were constantly in our minds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed absurd that we, two strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and another, and two women in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">full possession of health and strength,</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be terrorized by the miscreants</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cave. Yet a way out of the diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culty was hard to find.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had plenty of firearms and am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munition; we had one revolver and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">cartridges.

Flower held that it could not be man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged in any case, since the Greeks kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">their cave thoroughly closed all day time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that therefore we need not discuss</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim, and for the matter of that my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, had a notion that some way might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be found.

I could not, and that was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was to it. I crept at the best speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could muster along the wall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance slope, reached the opening and-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slung myself round the corner of it just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the first of the three men groped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the place where I had been stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a couple of seconds before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I cast a look down the track.

As yet, no more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I scuttled out on to the track. Pad-pad came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feet, drawing nearer; he would be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight immediately. Reckless of making</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound now, I flung myself into the cave</seg><seg type="columnLine">refuge where Flower and I had been keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing watch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I barked elbows and knees; I wrenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">one foot cruelly; I knocked-the wind out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my lean body as I fell--but I fell in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.

It had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very narrow escape. I hugged the box</seg><seg type="columnLine">tighter. We were nearly out of the wood</seg><seg type="columnLine">now.

Jim was seated comfortably</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a flat stone, eating coconut. I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">think he was very fond of it, but he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">it passed the time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I reckoned you'd get back all right,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he observed comfortably, shifting a hunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nut from one cheek to the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when he heard about the box, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as much excited as any one. I handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it over to Lady Mary; we all went into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cave, and Jim lighted up, with prodigal</seg><seg type="columnLine">display, almost the whole of our stock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">candlenut torches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We crowded round the sea lady.

For all I can do to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, for all the many people it harbors, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Court looks empty and sad.

On me, and me</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone of the company, the weight of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great secret had descended. I knew about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lady Mary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her name, it is true, I did not yet know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But a single telegram sent to any center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization when--or if--we got away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the island, would bring all the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation that we could desire. I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the telegram should be sent; I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">to whom it should be directed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knew that Lady Mary, whatever she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">romance</seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE TERRIBLE ISLAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was, was not Lady Maty; Lady she might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, probably was, but her real name was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alexandra, and she had been named after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the highest lady in the land, whose god-</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter and maid she was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No wonder that I had thought I remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered that still, self-possessed way she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">of standing with her hands before her--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen its like on the platform of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred public functions in England. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder that a likeness had haunted me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown to myself, when I looked at our</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea maiden.

I turned again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, looked to the darkness of the cavt^</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the face of Rocky Jim showing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dim white blur; to the beach, moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">silvered, with the wild bananas swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">their vanes like great, dark, snatching</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands across Orion's jeweled belt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard the upward crash and downward</seg><seg type="columnLine">suck of wave after wave on the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls outside; I heard the sinister hum of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reefs away at sea, like the call of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">myriad giant hornets. The moon climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and up among the white stems of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm-trees; the bell-bird ceased its</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinkling in the forest; the ghost-pigeon</seg><seg type="columnLine">that wails in deep night, when all true</seg><seg type="columnLine">pigeons are asleep, and that lures--so</seg><seg type="columnLine">Papuans say--the wanderer into dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">places of the bush, and he loses sight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dies, took up its melancholy crying. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">still I could not sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought that Flower's watch must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost over. I got up and walked bare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot, over the cold sand; there was no use</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying awake like this when I could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a companion to relieve my loneliness. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not see the surveyor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I supposed he had gone up to the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the island to look about him and make</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that no more trouble need be expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Greeks. I found a quiet seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the rocks--my strained foot was</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving some slight trouble--and settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself to wait.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a minute or two I saw him coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">up from the edge of the sea. His hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hair were dripping; he had evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">been bathing his head to cool himself. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to speak to him when I caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of his face in the full moonlight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that upon it which closed my lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God tempers the wind to the shorn</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamb." It was Sterne who said that, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ought to have known, for, with all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">genius, he was weak to stand against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winds of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I think God does so temper the crudest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all winds for us who are shorn of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strengths and splendors of other men.

But the hell that I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Flower's face when, thinking himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone with the night and his agony, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up to the unpitying skies and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched his great arms abroad and beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wrung his hands, was as far from me</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the heaven that he had hoped for was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever out of my reach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt shamed to my soul to have spied</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his agony. I knew now why he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not spoken; why he had wanted the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch of the night so that he might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone to wrestle with the blow that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen on him. I knew that he had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken the ring the sea lady wore and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">few unconscious references to "Cedric"</seg><seg type="columnLine">very seriously; that he had hoped and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had loved, as few men in the world can</seg><seg type="columnLine">love, with all the great heart and soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">enshrined in his great body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had, in the days that passed, heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of the history of his first mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage. It was a sad and a heroic tale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had married a woman who drank; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble had developed during their engage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and Flower had insisted on carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his promise, in the hope of saving her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had not saved her; after a struggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">I?o	BEATRICE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that lasted for long and bitter years, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had died--of drink--leaving him defeated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">free, and so weary with the fight that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never since her death cared to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">any woman a second glance, until Lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary came, and--as he did not tell me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as I knew--took him captive with Che</seg><seg type="columnLine">first look of her innocent lovely eyes, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">as long as life should last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, he had hoped. And this was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end. No one, reading that letter, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have mistaken the fact that it was written</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a lover to the woman who had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">him her promise, and upon whom he relied</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he relied on God or Heaven. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understand all of it myself, but so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much was clear. Clear, also, was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">other dizzying truth that I thought Flower</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not even perceived that placed our</seg><seg type="columnLine">little sea lady, by right, within the range</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the "fierce light that beats upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">throne."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If I had ever thought of pointing out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him this additional barrier, I lost all</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of it now.

There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">good end to be served by revealing it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The question of the moment was how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get back to the cave without being</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. I turned cold when I thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flower, reserved as an Indian, sensitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">as only a strong man is sensitive, knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had watched him in his moment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandonment. He had calmed down now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was sitting with his head propped</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his hand, in an attitude that spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more than quiet dejection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not even his sorrow could make him</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmindful for a moment of his duty. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">feat where he could overlook the whole of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slope leading down from the summit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the island, and from time to time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his head and scanned it closely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something or other that he saw, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancied he saw, caused him by and by.</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rise and walk a little forward.

He peeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">candlenut torches, so that she should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light she fancied of nights in her sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-cave, and in silence left them where</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could find them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He plaited her a new wide hat, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">as big as an umbrella, out of palm-leaves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">and handed it to her without a word, leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing barely time for thanks before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned away into the bush again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Often in the night, when it was Jim's</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch or mine, we might see Flower's great</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaggy head lifted up from his bracken</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed and peering from the doorway of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave; or one of us, patrolling about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope, might suddenly come upon him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">loping down, with that deerhound stride</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his, from the plateau, whither he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone to make an unexpected visit. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to trust no one but himself to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard over the sea lady.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim and I, talking things over, agreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was taking the Greeks almost too</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously. After all, we argued, things</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not go on like this forever. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been near three weeks on the island,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in all that time the men of the cave</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never--to our knowledge--been out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">daylight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If they came out at night, it was with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the utmost caution, using the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see as a sentry, so that they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">get back in a hurry, should any one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us come along. They would certainly get</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired of this sort of thing. They would</seg><seg type="columnLine">run up some kind of flag of truce--</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeal to us in some way--try to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">terms. So Jim and I argued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flower used to listen to us, if he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">present, in utter silence. He was not much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a talker at the best of times, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">want of responsiveness on his part had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chilling effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you agree with us?" I asked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the time of the evening meal. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sitting inside the cave, our log stools</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed about a table that we men had man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged to knock up out of the natural planks</seg><seg type="columnLine">found buttressing the roots of certain great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Papuan-trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were careful with our ship-provisions</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowadays; lemon-grass tea smoked in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">tins; fish from the lagoon were served on</seg><seg type="columnLine">platters of banana-leaf, white coconut</seg><seg type="columnLine">cream, with red peppers cut up on it, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a coconut-shell at every one's elbow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dip the morsels in, since we had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sauce.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had a single precious biscuit apiece;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Sapphira had stewed a mess of mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellaneous fruits in a couple of ox-tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">tins, and served it for a sweet course. De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite the absence of the story-book bread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruits and yams and oranges and bananas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which are never found on true "desolate</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands," we thought that Ku-Ku's island</seg><seg type="columnLine">was doing us none too badly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flower dipped a piece of parrot-fish in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coconut sauce and ate it before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," was all he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not?"

"For</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time past, those men have been say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to one another, just as we have, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this state of affairs can't continue.

It was impos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CRIMSHAW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sible to tell. That supreme self-control of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hers, like clear ice about a flower, showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet protected the beauty of her heart and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. One saw--one suspected the sweet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of that which lay within, but one</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not touch the lovely thing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea lady's secrets were her own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet I thought that the shadow which</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested on the face of the big surveyor, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">these latter days, threw some portion of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade on her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he had not done speaking. He held</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his tin to Sapphira for more of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lemon-grass tea, swallowed it, as if to clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice, which seemed less under control</seg><seg type="columnLine">than usual--perhaps he had caught some</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold wandering about the island--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on, with a change of subject that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed curiously abrupt--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I want to do some hunting tomorrow."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What are you going to hunt?" de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded Sapphira, alert at the mention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything that might concern the kitchen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pigs," said Flower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We who walk somewhat apart from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of humanity have strange intui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions at times.

The me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanical piano was silent.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">few loungers-about were apathetic and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepy.

Gently, lithely as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cat she unwound herself from the arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">that enclosed her bare shoulder.

With surpiizing ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derness all the guests assisted in getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poor chap up-stairs, while their pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prietor gave sharp orders. For once Aunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cynthy had really hustled. The best room</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented a fairly neat appearance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stella opened the windows and let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night breeze play over the still figure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then she knelt and put her ear to his heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's breathin'," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Kid scowled. But he went off</seg><seg type="columnLine">down-stairs with the rest at her bidding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the doctor arrived, there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh fever of activity.

Then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">let down her pale, fine hair and combed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">up again into a plain, loose twist. Rum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maging through a trunk, she brought up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrinkled but clean blue gingham house-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress, and from somewhere unearthed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white apron.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She hardly knew herself when she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done.

He was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved. With a curt nod he told her what</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do. In half an hour the other doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">came. Things hummed in the sick-room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And thus began a new, strange chapter</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the life of old Pete Jackson's Stella.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, if she hadn't had a natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">knack for nursing, she never could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten away with it. But ever since she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a child, she had loved to take care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sick. It was the one useful thing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth she did love. Many an old seafarer</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had nursed back to health--and young</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones, too, who never forgot her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for her guests giving her away, she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had no fear. She had a reputation for fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">play herself, and they would do the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">by her in this, her latest whim. Aunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cynthy could see to the cooking and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scholar could look after things generally.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Scholar never paid any board anyway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so she could ask him.

Pete had showed her how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to apply it. He had also taught her that</seg><seg type="columnLine">her surest asset--surer than the uncertain</seg><seg type="columnLine">receipts of the hotel--was her slim beauty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And she had been an apt pupil. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">earned an unsavory reputation at a tender</seg><seg type="columnLine">age, and always managed to live up to it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her house, while keeping the letter of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">law, was avoided by all who valued their</seg><seg type="columnLine">good name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What charm, therefore, could there be</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her in playing the dull role of nurse?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why, the charm of the unknown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL her crowded young life she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered what it would be like not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be shunned as old Pete's girl. She had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at infrequent intervals, longed for quiet, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled waters, for humdrum respectabil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity. Her friends were so unrestful, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ready fists and passions. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually craved drudgery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now she was to have it, and in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">own house, too. Already she was enjoying</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself. She liked the homely, laborious</seg><seg type="columnLine">tasks the doctors gave her. And she found</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself interested in the fate of the poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed-up young man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day the first doctor mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landlady to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where is that young heathen that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordering every one around here last night?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, she goes and comes," evaded Stella.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I guess she don't look after her business."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Apparently not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lowered his tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is a tough joint, I hear," he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She jumped.

"I ain't seen nothin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">out o' the way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, you wouldn't," he answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">STELLA MARIS- OF PETE'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">&gt;37</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was that a compliment? She thought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course it is doubtful if the charm of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the humdrum would have lasted in other</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances. If the patient had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly charmless himself, for instance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as soon as the doctors agreed that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would pull through, her interest in him</seg><seg type="columnLine">became something other than that of nurse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For he was like a young chiseled god, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. He reminded her of the statues</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Scholar had taken her to see in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">classical museum once. Fair, regular fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures; fair, crisp curling hair; long gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashes. She wondered about his eyes. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't opened them yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And who was he? His clothes spelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. The chauffeur had said he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking Mr. Gregory back to school. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had meant to ask that chauffeur a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, but he had hurried away to notify</seg><seg type="columnLine">"the guardian," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE expected the young man's relatives</seg><seg type="columnLine">would show up soon. They must feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But nobody came except the chauffeur</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, with a roll of bills that would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">given Pete apoplexy, and the message that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Gregory's guardian, Mr. Estis, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly distressed over the accident and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be out to see him just as soon as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could spare the time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stella was highly indignant at that mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage and told the chauffeur so. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely shrugged like the well-trained ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vant he was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then on the third day the young man</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his eyes. Stella nearly dropped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle she was carrying. For his eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clearest gray she ever saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You look like an English girl," was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first remark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shook her head.

But in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few months he would be twenty-one, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he would have control of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs. He would probably go into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">guardian's office. But then again, maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wouldn't. He might strike out for him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. From the nonchalant way he spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">of money she knew he had plenty.

And Gregory Allison was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a model patient. He obeyed the doctor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he obeyed the nurse. If they told him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin and bear it, he grinned and bore it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If they told him to shut his eyes and try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep, he shut his eyes and tried to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it's hard not to be able to talk to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you all I want to," he told Stella the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">day.

It was the horse, not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rider, that had been hit; and with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muzzle of his own rifle at the small of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, Toby was now driven the six long</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles that separated his habitation from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the port.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He passed the time for his captor</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely.

It was not a long story, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night when the priest of Obi lay safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Scarborough jail and half a dozen black</seg><seg type="columnLine">policemen set out to catch Mamie and find</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stricken horse, Wynne gave the harbor</seg><seg type="columnLine">master particulars of his own adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then proceeded to Toby's own narra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope the old devil was lying," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"for he's told me something that will</seg><seg type="columnLine">darken my life forever if it's true.

Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">swore that he put away Stockly--poisoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">him--and that the man never went near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea, but lies buried in his own compound</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside his den. And--it's horrible, Rice--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he says my father fell out with him a month</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he died and turned on him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped certain payments and so on, know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that Toby's word could do him no</seg><seg type="columnLine">harm.

He took his horse and his clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they were found and buried him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other.

When Abraham had</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing else to do, he went to see the store-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keepers on the West Side, and from there</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was sure to bring back a few orders to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the machines busy. Long strips of</seg><seg type="columnLine">silk-sausages, which the dexterous Mr. Ber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and some, or all, of his children turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside-out with thin sticks which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">manipulated most wonderfully, became ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gant neckties before the Berman family</seg><seg type="columnLine">were through with them. Between supper</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bedtime Mrs. Berman sewed the labels</seg><seg type="columnLine">on and there was no one in the family who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could press them as well as Regina Berman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the manufacturer's eldest daughter, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">also gave the last touch to a tie before it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was packed for shipment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On Saturday evenings Abraham came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get his pay, and incidentally, also, to enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything in the books and to make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mail the bills to the customers. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only his work. It was his privilege.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abraham was twenty and earned only</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen a week, but in the five years since</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had arrived in New York, he had man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged to save a few thousand dollars. His</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">155</seg><seg type="columnLine">l5t&gt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KONRAD BERCOVICI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">employer frequently made use of part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this sum; improved his credit by paying</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bills promptly with the loan he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his working man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abraham's willingness to lend money to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his employer will be easily understood if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is mentioned right here that he had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his mind to marry Regina Berman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Regina was the ideal wife for him. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">too "Yankeefied," keeping the Sabbath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking Yiddish well, a good housewife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As to her pressing neckties, it was a well</seg><seg type="columnLine">known fact that she could do it better than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one, even better than Abraham him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, although he knew the trade from A to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Z. It was like a gift from Heaven. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Berman's children were gifted in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction. A necktie coming out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berman factory was a masterpiece. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Regina outclassed them all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abraham Zussman never thought of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">without thinking of her ability to trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form a rag into a beautiful necktie. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">five years he had been in America he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of nothing else but neckties, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was sure that everybody worth while</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking to was interested in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Regina Berman was still wearing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair in long, loose braids over her shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the high-school girl style; distin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guishing her from the working girls. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">almond-shaped, large, dark eyes stood well</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart on top of a lightly arched nose. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth was somewhat wide and full, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">her chin was delicate and harmonized with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broad forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What made her still more attractive was</seg><seg type="columnLine">her cheerful disposition, her sprightliness;</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was always ready to smile and laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sing. She was the pride of the family.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her* picture and her school-certificate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">framed and enribboned, hung in the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">conspicuous part of the room over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolltop desk at which Abraham occasionally</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That Regina still went to school was due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her mother's ambition to make a school-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teacher out of her. A school-teacher ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to her as the priestess of a beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">and useful god presiding over the destinies</seg><seg type="columnLine">of children. It was no sacrilege to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was it not because of the school-teachers</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there were no pogroms in America as</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Russia? And had she not lost her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother in such a pogrom? And hadn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they come here, leaving a prosperous grain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">business in Russia, because of the pogroms?</seg><seg type="columnLine">So Regina had to become a school-teacher</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a compensation for what this country</seg><seg type="columnLine">was doing for the children, no matter if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Berman, who had more practical plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerning his daughter, agreed or not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Berman's plan was a very simple one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At eighteen Regina was to be graduated</seg><seg type="columnLine">from high school.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Abraham Zussman's capital should by</seg><seg type="columnLine">then be over three thousand dollars. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abraham consented to become a partner in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the business, he would take him for a son-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in-law. The firm of Berman &amp; Zussman</seg><seg type="columnLine">could then begin to operate on a large scale</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he, Berman, would become the presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent of his lodge--an ambition he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurtured because of his dislike of Mr. Sam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uel Goldstein, the "&amp; Co.*' of the firm of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cohen &amp; Co., Cloak Manufacturers, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grand Street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Regina also had plans for the future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She wanted to become an actress.

Of course,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Bermans were very pleased when their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">daughter appeared in the amateur theatri-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cal performances of her school, but that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was not like being a professional actress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Actors and actresses, the Bermans thought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">old-fashionedly, were all right on the stage,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but as relatives, God forgive!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With the singleness of purpose character-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">istic of women and of her race Regina</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thought of nothing else but the stage, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thought more about it because she did not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dilute her thought with talk about her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dreams. She had seen a few plays in Eng-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lish and had been quite often with her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">parents to the Yiddish theater on Second</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Avenue, where a sixty-year-old, rather</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">portly woman played the role of a sixteen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">year-old girl and drew tears from the easily</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">impressed audience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When Regina was seventeen, Mr. Ber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man began to bestir himself in her and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own behalf; he had seldom contradicted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife. He hated scenes. Like all Jewish</seg><seg type="columnLine">husbands he was the real master of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. So he let his wife go on dreaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the teaching-profession for Regina,</seg><seg type="columnLine">BROKEN DREAMS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing that his own plans would ulti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mately be realized.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '•You know, Abraham, I want you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">devote more time to sales.

As he lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hat to her, she put a finger on her lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But not a word of this to any one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good night and thanks," she called out, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she ran up the dark stairs of the ill-illumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated, moldy, ill-smelling hallway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The following evening Abraham invited</seg><seg type="columnLine">Regina for a walk on the avenue. The girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted the invitation against the feeble</seg><seg type="columnLine">protests of her mother. Strange how her</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude toward Abraham Zussman had</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed in a few days. He had never ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isted at all as far as she was concerned. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a working man in her father's shop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To a romantic girl of Regina's type a youth</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as Abraham had no attraction whatso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And suddenly the change. Because she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had confided her dream to him, he became</seg><seg type="columnLine">a different man in her eyes. Because he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened to her and had not contradicted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not scoffed, not discouraged, she was anx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious to be alone with him again, walk by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side on crowded Second Avenue and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pour into his ears all she had dreamed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">since she was a child--a stage, an audience,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she the center of it all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As soon as they were on the street, Abra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham opened the conversation by telling her</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had thought the whole night about</seg><seg type="columnLine">what she had told him the previous day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I think you could be a great actress."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She slipped her arm in his and an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered--	,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's very nice of you to think so,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and woman-like she made him assure her</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and again that she was to be a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">actress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I will come to see you act on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage and you will not even know that I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, Regina," he-moaned sadly as he sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on a bench in Stuyvesant Square.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't be a child, Abraham," she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied, nestling close to him.

How?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she would not tell him how. It was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">high time to return home with her. To-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow, if he wished, he could take her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the theater, to the English theater, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they played "Hamlet!" He promised. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way home she told him the story of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">play, dwelling chiefly on the great role of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ophelia. Abraham was greatly impressed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was only too anxious to go and see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">play with her the following evening. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in the hallway of her home and talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," said Zussman before leaving,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"wouldn't your mother be against it--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean that you should go with me to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">theater?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leave ma to pa," she laughingly an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered, as she allowed him to hold her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand in his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN Abraham Zussman came to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vite Regina to the theater the fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing evening, the girl's eyes were very</seg><seg type="columnLine">red, but her braids were no longer hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her shoulders. She was dressed ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go, and there was strong decision in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice as she said to the boy--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must hurry, Abraham; it's getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">late."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Regina, you have cried," Abraham said</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her as soon as they were on the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, it's nothing," she answered, press-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his arm, and kept very quiet on the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the play.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was very quiet all through the per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formance. Abraham tried hard to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation during the evening, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not so disposed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the way home she asked him--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you like the play?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did not think of the play.

"But you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> could have asked us--I am her father, am</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I not? There is her mother, too--but,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> well--America--children here don't ask</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> their parents."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THE two parents soon woke up to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fact that their little Regina was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woman striking out for her own shores.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She quit school without as much as "by-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">your-leave" and boldly announced that she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was going to become an actress. Whereas</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Abraham Zussman had formerly been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grateful for the slightest favor shown him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by his employer's wife, he now expected</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little services and accepted them as if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they were due him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And Solomon Berman too woke up to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">something he had not expected. He had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">expected Abraham to consider the marriage</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">• to his daughter and the subsequent inevi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">table partnership in the firm as a stroke of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fortune that comes once in a thousand years</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to one of two million men. But now, with-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out many preliminaries, Abraham an-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nounced that he was not going to invest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his money in the necktie business. Abra-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ham's decision made Berman realize that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it was he who ought to be thankful to Abra-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ham Zussman for taking his daughter in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lawful wedding without demanding any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dowry. Abraham had money; three thou-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sand dollars. What had Berman? Noth-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There were two distinct groups now in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the house. Berman and his wife, and Abra-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ham Zussman and Regina. The younger</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ones had the deciding voice in everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Abraham already bossed the factory; Re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gina bossed the house. When it finally</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came again to words between husband and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wife, Mrs. Berman said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "I say, Solomon, the quicker they marry,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the better it will be. I am not responsible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for what is going to happen if she keeps</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it up that way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may be right. For all the good it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will do me now, let them get married."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After reflecting for a few moments, Ber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe you could have a little shmoos</seg><seg type="columnLine">with your daughter about the partnership.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What do you say, Leah?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say nothing. But I think it was Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gina, that put that idea in his head, not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come in partnership with us. What does</seg><seg type="columnLine">she care about her father and mother?</seg><seg type="columnLine">She wants to be an actress. She speaks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, you should hear her, Solomon, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he were, who knows what--as if we don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know who he is. I would never have slaved</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her the way I did," the mother cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What brought about all this change,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what?" questioned Solomon Berman, talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing more to himself than expecting any an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer to his query.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But his wife was ready with the answer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if the question was just the thing she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had waited for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When I wanted to talk about it to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night when he invited her to the the-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ater, you had an important meeting at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lodge," she mimicked. "Ha? A meeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the lodge was more important to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the future of your daughter, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream of your wife."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Solomon Berman knew the answer to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">query now. It was youth against old age.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think it well that she should marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">early in the Spring, eh, Leah?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let them marry when they will. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">has broken my heart.

' '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And there was raillery, bitterness, sar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casm in his voice. It made the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry. He regretted his words. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never spoken to her in such a tone before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You did not understand me, Leah?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why must it be Regina?

I feel I want some tea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leah started to put the glasses on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, and going to and fro, she spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly to herself, partly to her husband.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And reallyj why not? If it's not Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gina, it will be Malka. A few years later.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well! What does it count? A few years</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner, a few years later. What does it</seg><seg type="columnLine">count, ha?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course it doesn't. Sit down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">have your tea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ABRAHAM and Regina went frequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the theaters. To the Yiddish ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first and to Broadway afterward. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen Regina act in the amateur per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formance she had spoken about and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressed by her ability then. He thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she could do such things at least as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, or even better, than pressing neckties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet later on, when he had seen other act-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ors, he was not so sure about that. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were many things that she had yet to learn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he concluded. She was, of course, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">gushy about her talents} as well as all</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage-struck young people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went together to the theaters, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">each had his or her own thoughts and rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons for doing so. She wanted to see roles;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came to observe the business-end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">theater. Regina's theatrical inclination</seg><seg type="columnLine">had set his mind traveling in a new direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. He informed himself about expenses</seg><seg type="columnLine">and incomes of the theater. About actors</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plays. About the chance of gain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stage, the thousands of heads, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries, the laughter, the problems proposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and resolved--the whole thing represented</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him only a different business in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were bigger chances than in the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was in just then. It had never occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him before that there was another busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness than neckties for him until then. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not love for his intended wife or in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clination that urged him in that direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was simply a chance to make more</seg><seg type="columnLine">money in a different business than neckties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He realized at once that his capital was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridiculously small for such an enterprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had formerly thought of himself as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich man. In his old business three thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand dollars was a capital to be reckoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with. In the theatrical business, he soon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">learned, it was about enough' for one day's</seg><seg type="columnLine">expenses. Tens of thousands of dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">were spoken of as lightly as if the dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">represented cents. It was a big business.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ante was bigger. It made him look on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own capital as something to be risked</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily on a chance of making more money</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He began to visit, with Regina and</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, the cafes frequented by Yiddish act-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ors. In the course of a few months he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered all the information necessary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conversation with better informed men</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him a certain polish. His willingness</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stand treat endeared him to many. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger vision served him even in his work as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a salesman. He brought in more orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">now in a day than he used to bring in in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his best week a few morfths before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To carry out these orders he had to ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance money to Berman to buy two more</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines, a cutting-table and several other</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. He became more than a partner in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the business; he practically was its owner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he looked on it as a side-line. His ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eyes were open for other things, bigger</seg><seg type="columnLine">things--the theater!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only a few months before Regina had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been infinitely his superior. Her ambitions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her learning as a high-sqhool girl were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky-high. That she consented to go out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him he had considered a heavenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">privilege in spite of the fact that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned to marry her years before. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">now he towered over her. His ambitions</seg><seg type="columnLine">were greater, and what he had picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from here and there was more than she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever known. He laughed to himself when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought how much he had admired this</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that inferior actor and the trashy plays</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had seen at first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Regina's ambitions! Well! Love now</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not color his judgment about her abil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity. There was much she had to learn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And if she succeeded, she would be a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">asset in the business. Stars commanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">big prices. Three and four hundred dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">a week. If he could save that at the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning, it would make things easier. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">with or without her he was determined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter the theatrical field. He had very</seg><seg type="columnLine">little to lose and the prospects were large.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thousands, tens of thousands. The Yid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dish theater was a mint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Regina too felt that Abraham had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come her superior. Long before they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">married, she took orders from him. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">KONRAD BERCOVIC!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he who enrolled her as a pupil in an East-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Side acting-school, treating her as one with</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior knowledge treats a beginner. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to love him. He was a man, a real</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and would make her a great actress.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Yiddish stage at first and then Broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Broadway, her name in electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights! Broadway--a star on Broadway!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the shop Solomon Berman was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">little more than a salaried employee. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">also took orders from the future son-in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">law. It dispirited him so that he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even attempt to run for the presidency of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lodge, to compete with Goldstein, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a tailor at home and was now a</seg><seg type="columnLine">manufacturer of clothing in America.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the wedding of Regina Berman</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Abraham Zussman finally took place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guests of Abraham outnumbered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">outshone the guests that came by Berman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">invitations. Abraham's guests were writers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and actors. It clearly established the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Bermans were passe and the Zuss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mans on the rise. It was not at all as Ber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man thought it would be--that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to apologize for accepting Abraham</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zussman as his son-in-law. It looked as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abraham Zussman had condescended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry Regina Berman, the dowryless</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter of a necktie-manufacturer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT THE beginning of the following sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son Abraham was the owner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Regina Theater, on Second Avenue.

He left his wife to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch the show from a first-row seat. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the gallery and observed the people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Noted when they laughed or cried, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interest sagged or..rose.

That end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the business was in the hands of a capa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble director, who assured Mr. Zussman that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was a genius.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Regina worked with him every day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who can describe the jealousies of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other actresses?

How they flattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Regina when they spoke to her, and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfiatteringly they spoke of her behind her</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. Every little mistake of routine of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the novice was immediately reported and</seg><seg type="columnLine">guffawed about to eager listeners in cafes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and restaurants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That lucky slip.

The first intimation she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the approaching hurricane was, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking across the straits, she saw an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming bark furl her canvas down to lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">tops'ls and square away to sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through her glasses she made out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bark to be the PappUlon, the French</seg><seg type="columnLine">prison-ship that for the past two years en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaged in transferring prisoners from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">penal colony of New Caledonia to Cayenne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ANXIOUSLY watching the oncoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud-bank, she ran the boat into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind, double-reefed the mains'l and set the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm-jib.

Maina lo leaped for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiller and threw all her weight against it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but with her deck buried amidships in</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm-whipped water, the Moonbeam lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">all steerageway and pounded head on into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seas. One after another the reef-lashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves raked the frail craft from stem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern.

Even momentarily she</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not relax her vigilance. She looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the white, merciless death about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smiled. The fear of death was not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. With blinded eyes she strove to pierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gloom ahead.

Her rigging and white, slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">spars stood drawn against the blackness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky like a delicate, silver-threaded pat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tern upon a curtain of black velvet. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was laboring heavily without a stitch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas. A storm-torn signal of distress</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluttered from the mizzen gaff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the cessation of the rain, the waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to rise.

Maina lo set her teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flung herself face down upon the deck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a fresh turn about her waist with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">halyards. For one breathless moment she</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited with the thunder of the oncoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters in her ears. The Moonbeam lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentarily passive like a hunted stag</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaiting the coup de grace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then with a last brave attempt to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the onslaught, she staggered into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thundering death. The tiller snapped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maina lo's hand like a piece of match-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood. With terrific force she was hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the mast, the waist-rope almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting her in twain by the force of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">onrushing waters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bereft of the guiding hand, the Moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam swung broadside to the seas. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">jib blew out with the noise of a blast. Top-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mast and jib-boom went crashing over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stunned and half-drowned, Maina lo</seg><seg type="columnLine">groped her way on hands and knees along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engulfed deck to the companionway</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tore the hatchet from the rack. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleeding hands she chopped the tangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigging adrift to prevent the dragging top-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mast from pounding a hole in the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On examination she found the rudder</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried away. Only a broken splinter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood remained, swinging uselessly above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water-line. Cutting one of the oars</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its lashings, she chopped a deep notch</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the stern, laid the oar in the notch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashed it securely to the top hinge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken rudder. Then rising to her feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she threw her weight against the oar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">righted the boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was almost abreast of the Pappillon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fifty yards to starboard the great black</seg><seg type="columnLine">hull of the prison-ship towered monstrously</seg><seg type="columnLine">above her, her stern pointing toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. She was foundering by her head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Foc'sle-head and forward deck lay en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulfed to the fore-hatch. Crowsnests and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigging were crowded with human forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaiting the end. The fragments of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">splintered lifeboats dragged in the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the tackle at her davits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Against the railing of the poop-deck a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd of prisoners was lined up. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors with hammers and chisels were strik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the shackles from the unfortunate men</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the iron hawser-bits. As fast as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was freed, each man leaped for the rig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bark was drifting helplessly before</seg><seg type="columnLine">CARL CLAUSEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the gale. With her forward hold half-full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water she staggered drunkenly to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave. Curious, incredulous faces stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at the frail craft with the lone half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nude figure of a girl standing upright in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern, guiding the boat with only an oar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A sailor in the mizzen truck waved his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sou'wester to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above the tumult of the wind came</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly the sound of voices. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheering her. From the rigging and yard-'</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms flashed a message of tribute from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred doomed men. Then suddenly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great bark plunged head down in the waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the mainmast. Her stern rose in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air with the dripping rudder pointing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky. One by one the men in the rig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging dropped into the sea. The two sailors</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned their hammers and chisels and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped from the railing of the poop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the stern stood the solitary figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man silhoutted against the sky, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">manacled hands raised above his head, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last of the prisoners whom the sailors had</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned in their efforts to save them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves. A giant of a man he was, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great shock of yellow curls dancing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gale. He was signaling to her, pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">astern with his manacled hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Maina lo measured the distance with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, cast all her weight upon the oar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung the Moonbeam under the stem</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter of the bark. Tying a bowline in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main halyards, she threw the rope over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board and signaled her readiness. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific swing the man brought down his</seg><seg type="columnLine">manacled wrists across the hawser-bit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking the shackle-chain. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Straining at her oar, Maiija lo saw his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head rise in the wake of the sinking bark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few feet astern. The Moonbeam stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered momentarily as the man caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragging rope and rose half-way out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water with the sudden strain. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next moment two bloody, mangled arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the broken shackle-chains dangling</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the torn flesh were thrust over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railing. Grasping the man beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">armpits, Maina lo dragged him to safety</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sprang back to her oar, just as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last of the PappUlon disappeared beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NIGHT came with the hurricane spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a chill moon rising out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea. Weary and worn, Maina lo left her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">oar and knelt* beside the prostrate form</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon the deck. By neither sound nor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">movement did the man betray sign of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">One mangled wrist lay across a forehead</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">white as death. The broken shackle-chain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swung tangled in his hair with the move-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ments of the boat. She looked at the man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">helplessly. To all appearances he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dead. She had risked her life and boat to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When she accidentally touched his fore-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">head with the tips of her fingers, she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thought she saw a faint flutter of the eye-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lids. She placed her ear against his breast</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and listened breathlessly. Barely percep-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tible yet unmistakably came the soft beat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing of his heart. Life was not quite ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tinct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For several minutes she sat looking at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him perplexedly. Across the moon-flooded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">waste long, swift lines of ponderously cat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">footed rollers moved from horizon to hori-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">zon, breaking in menacing white-capped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thunder about the boat. Phalanx after</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">phalanx of storm-torn clouds charged the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">young ascending moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The storm still raged in the higher levels,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">though but the merest breath of wind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fanned her cheek as the boat coasted down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the rollers. A blue layer of chill, shroudy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mist hung low over the sea with an in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">terminable stretch of clear, sparkling space</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">above. A sinister, brooding peace of fury-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gorged elements enwrapped the universe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Against the deck the face of the uncon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scious man glowed ghastly beneath his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">matted, brine-soaked locks that moved</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Medusa-like in the wash of the deck with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the pitching of the boat. A strange freak</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of circumstances had placed in Maina lo's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hands the fate of one of the hated race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Only in the fact that he was a convict and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">therefore in the estimation of his own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">people -no better than she, did Maina lo</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">-find in her heart a sense of pity for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like herself, he was very young. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">downy golden beard covered his vigorous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aggressive jaw. His nose was straight, fine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly molded, with sensitive blue-veined nos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trils. There was &amp; bold, careless quality</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the repose of his face. Where his shirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay open, the skin of his throat glowed soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">and velvety beneath its coat of sun-bitten</seg><seg type="columnLine">tan. A pathetic boyish look, reminiscent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a brutally disillusioned childhood, hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the corners of his mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Taking his head in her lap, she began</seg><seg type="columnLine">SOME PEARLS AND A SWINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to rub his face and chest briskly and rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him back and forth to induce circulation</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his frozen arteries. After several min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes of unceasing labor she was rewarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by feeling the play of his reviving muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">under her touch. When she placed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-soaked blanket under his head, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his eyes for a fraction of a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gazed up at her unseeingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Letting her hand fall upon his shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she leaned over him breathlessly, searching</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes by the faint light of the moon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deep blue, the color of mother of pearl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they gazed beyond her into nothingness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he had closed them again, she sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost in thought, studying the blank repose</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, rising to her feet, with a look of</seg><seg type="columnLine">determination upon her face, she found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatchet and knocked the cover off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatchway. Below decks everything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">snug and tight. Groping about in the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">she found matches and lighted the lantern</seg><seg type="columnLine">which swung from the beam above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunk. She extended her stiff, frozen hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the flame and looked about with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sigh of relief. Not a drop of water had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the staunch little craft shipped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Returning on deck, she dragged the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious man below, dropped him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunk and began to strip him of his wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">garments. When she pulled his coarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">prison-shirt over his head, she gave a gasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">of horror. From the neck to the waist his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back was a mass of horrible, bloody bruises.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She knew too well the mark of a cat-o'-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine-tails to be mistaken. Cords of beaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh lay in livid lines from armpit to arm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit. He had been brutally whipped. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sob of mingled rage and compassion she</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked away feverishly and flung the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his water-soaked garments on deck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tender-handed and pitying, she anointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his body with healing oil from her locker</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bound up his mangled hands with</seg><seg type="columnLine">strips torn from the blankets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She forgot race-hatred and prejudice in</seg><seg type="columnLine">administering aid and comfort to the help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, white-skinned stranger who had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her out of the sea, bruised and bleeding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She rolled herself into the blankets against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his icy body that the warmth of her youth</seg><seg type="columnLine">might kindle into flame the flickering spark</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life. With maiden shyness she drew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face to her breast and closed her eyes. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">indescribable feeling of peace and content-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment came to her. She slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN she awoke, she was alone. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin was flooded with warm noon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tide sunshine. The boat swung lazily upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a calm, sunlit sea. She heard him move</seg><seg type="columnLine">about on deck. Wondering, she sat up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked about. Before leaving, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tucked the blankets around her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She crawled on deck and found him</seg><seg type="columnLine">curled up, prison-garbed, on the mainsail</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his back against the mast. She dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">not lift her eyes for fear of encountering</seg><seg type="columnLine">his.

For I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed about people that when they try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get somethin' extra into their lives, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuss around like you did with this wheel</seg><seg type="columnLine">tryin' to find a place for it, that they don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">need it, and do all right without it; and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other hand, other people lose some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin' so little it don't seem to count, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet they can't get along without it. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">also sometimes a man thinks lie's improved</seg><seg type="columnLine">on creation by leavin' somethin' out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, or gettin' rid of somethin' in society</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it turns out that it didn't belong there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just like this wheel. We get fooled a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal; for you know, my boy put that extra</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel on your bench." And then Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zemple said, gettin' mad--"Some boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">have lost pins or never had any. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fathers don't raise 'em up right." And Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller said: "This town is just full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels that have nothin' to do with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•Copyright, 1020, by Edgar Lee Masters in the United States and Great Britavn.

They either belong somewhere else,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or they are left overs of other times--like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henry Bannerman." referring to the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">that spent all day every day walkin' up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on the stone floor back of the pillars</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the court house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I want to come back to Mitch's watch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But first I remember it was about now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a troupe came to town playin' Rip Van</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winkle, and Mr. Miller and my pa took</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mitch and me to see it. And as we came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back home, pa said to Mr. Miller: "Henry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bannerman is a kind of Rip Van Winkle--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a extra wheel--he's been asleep ten years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway." So Mitch and me began to beg</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the story about Henry Bannerman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was that he drank until he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fever and when he came out of the fever, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was blurred like and not keen like when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could recite Shakespeare and practice law</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine. So pa said that onct when Henry first</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to practice law again after cornin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the fever, he had a little office in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the court house and Alcibiades Watkins</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in to see him about a boundary fence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sat down and told Henry about it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">takin' about an hour. When Alcibiades</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished, Henry says: "Tell it to me over;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's a long story and important and I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get it right." So Alcibiades told it over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then Henry says, "You came to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sult me, did you?" Alcibiades said yes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well," says Henry, "I'll have to charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">you--I'll have to charge you two dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the advice." And so Alcibiades took</seg><seg type="columnLine">out two dollars and handed it to Henry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and waited for the advice. And Henry</seg><seg type="columnLine">said: "Well, Alcibiades, I have listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you for two hours about this boundary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the boundary fence, and I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing about it, and my advice to you is</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go and see Mr. Kirby who can under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand it and is a good lawyer." So Alci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">biades said, "Well, I know, but I came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you for advice." "Yes," said Henry, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know you did, and I have giv it to you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">go and see Mr. Kirby--he's a good lawyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and will tell you what more to do and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do it. You see I'm not a barrister--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm just a solicitor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Mr. Miller and my pa talked, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as much fun almost as the show. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to know everything and to kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand back of Mitch and me, next to God,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or somethin' strong that could keep any</seg><seg type="columnLine">harm away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But to come back to Mitch's watch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">George Heigold had a piece of lead with</seg><seg type="columnLine">printing letters on one side, in copper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They called it a stereotype, and it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">print. And he wanted to trade Mitch for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the watch, so he offered his stereotype; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Mitch was crazy about printin' and</seg><seg type="columnLine">books, Mitch traded and was glad of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. But when Mr. Miller found it out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said: "What did you do that for?</seg><seg type="columnLine">That lead stereotype ain't worth nothin'--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and here you have traded off your watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I gave you. You know, I think you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are goin' to be a author--for authors give</seg><seg type="columnLine">their time and everything they have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">print things--and this looks like the key</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your life, and a sign of what your life</seg><seg type="columnLine">is goin' to be. So I think I'll begin with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and put you in the office of the Ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">server to learn the printer's trade like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Franklin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course this stereotype would print;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mitch printed with it a good deal, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it always printed the same thing, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fun soon died down and Mitch really</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished he had his watch back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So that's how Mitch began to set type</seg><seg type="columnLine">and help run a newspaper. The editor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cassius Wilkinson, and a good deal of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he was in Springfield, and the rest he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was talkin' politics or gettin' drunk. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the paper just run itself. The foreman</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Dutchie Bale, who used to go to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farm papers or the Chicago papers and just</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut great pieces out of 'em and set 'em in</seg><seg type="columnLine">type for the paper; and as the editor didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">care and Dutchie didn't care what went</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the paper, Mitch had a chance to write</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the paper himself; and also Mr. Miller</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped in some wonderful things and</seg><seg type="columnLine">people began to say that the paper was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookin' up. While Mr. Wilkinson, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">editor, smiled and took the compliments</seg><seg type="columnLine">give him just like he deserved 'em. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">onct Mitch printed one of his poems about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Salem, where one of the verses was:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     Down by the mill where Lincoln lived,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     Where the waters whirl and swish,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     I love to sit when school is out,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     Catchin' a nice cat fish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I don't believe Mitch worked in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspaper more'n a week or ten days, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">lots happened; and I went down to see him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good deal to hear Dutchie Bale talk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swear. He swore awful especially on press</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, for the press nearly always broke</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROMANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">MITCH MILLER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">down just as they started to print. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dutchie would turn loose:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look at the old corn-sheller, look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old cider mill, look at the junk, (all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time puttin' in the awfulest profanity).</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here he's over at Springlied, and me run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nin' the paper and tryin' to print a paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a grindstone like this. I'm goin' to</seg><seg type="columnLine">quit--i've had enough of this (more terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble profanity)."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mitch would be standin' there half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scared and half laughin', ancF another</seg><seg type="columnLine">printer named Sandy Bill would be sayin':</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why don't you tighten that bolt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dutchie?" Then Dutchie would crawl</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the press and start to do what Sandy</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, but findin' that the bolt was all right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd crawl out again and maybe see Sandy</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of laughin'. So thinkin' Sandy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolin' him, they'd begin to quarrel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe, it would end with Dutchie throwin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">a monkey wrench at Sandy and rushin' out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room. He'd come back later, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you couldn't really drive him off the place;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and maybe after a hour or two the paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be printed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, Mr. Miller had wrote a long poem</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the Indians, and he began to print</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and then somethin' happened. A man</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Pemberton, which they called the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack of Clubs, and a man named Hockey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they called "Whistlin' Dick" had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful fight by the corner store, and Mitch</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrote up the fight for the paper, the editor</seg><seg type="columnLine">bein' in Springfield, and Dutchie not ear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in' what was printed. Mitch called 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">human wind-mills and when the paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out, everybody in town began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh and the papers sold like hot cakes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Wilkinson was in Springfield and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothin' to do with it, but Whistlin' Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought Mr. Wilkinson had written the</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece and put it in. So he kept goin' to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the depot waitin' for Mr. Wilkinson to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the train from Springfield. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did, which was in a day or two, he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">right up to Mr. Wilkinson and hit him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then proceeded to lick him until he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough and got up and ran, though he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sayin' all Ihe time that he didn't write the</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece- and didn't know nothin' about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Mr. Wilkinson came to the office and</seg><seg type="columnLine">read the piece and Dutchie told him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mitch wrote it. And that ended Mitch as</seg><seg type="columnLine">an editor. He was afraid to go back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office anyway, in addition to bein'</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXVII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MITCH was now a changed boy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone could see it. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">come around as much as he used to. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">first Mr. Miller set him to work to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the printer's trade as I have told. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept him away from me; but after he lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">the job, still I didn't see him like I used to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I looked -him up a good deal, but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mostly quiet. He didn't want to fish, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">to swim, or to go out to the farm--he just</seg><seg type="columnLine">read, Shakespeare and other books; lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the grass by his house. And he wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">come down to see me much, because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said it made him think of Little Billie.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Zueline had gone away with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother, they said to Springfield; and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">she'd been home, Mitch couldn't have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">her anyway. I was terribly lonesome with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out Mitch and the days dragged, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept hearin' of him bein' off with Charley</seg><seg type="columnLine">King and George Heigold and it worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harold Carman had been put in jail, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then let out on bond, which held him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">testify in the Rainey case. And one day</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mitch came to me and says: "I'm really</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught in this law. I've been to see your</seg><seg type="columnLine">pa. I thought I'd told my story once and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would do; but he says there'll be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new jury that never has heard about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case or what I know; and I'll have to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all over again. And with Harold Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to tell about their tryin' to get him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say he found a pistol, and my story, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">can convict Temple Scott. So I'm caught,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if we had ever so much to do, and ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much treasure to find, or trips to take,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd have to put it aside for this here law</seg><seg type="columnLine">and testifyin'. And if they knew how I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated it, they'd never ask me if I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">like it and like makin' a sensation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">actin' the part of Tom Sawyer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Pina'fore was played at last, and we all</seg><seg type="columnLine">went, but when my pa sang the Merry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Merry Maiden and the Tar, Mitch got up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left the hall, because as he said to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward, it brought back that awful night</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Joe Rainey was killed. It must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">affected others that way too; that and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">death of Mrs. Rainey, who had a part in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the show. For they only played two nights,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of three, which they intended. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough came to make it worth while.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then one night I went" up to see Mitch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the house seemed quieter. The girls</seg><seg type="columnLine">EDGAR LEE MASTERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">176</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was playin' as before, but not so wild.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Miller was reading to Mrs. Miller,</seg><seg type="columnLine">English history or something; but Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller looked kind of like she was tryin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pay attention. She didn't act interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">and happy like she used to. Mitch told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me then that his pa had been let out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the church; that while we was gone to</seg><seg type="columnLine">St. Louis the trustees met and decided that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they wanted a minister who would put a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot of go into the church and get converts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and make things hum; that the mortgage</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the church had to be met and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't meet it without gettin' more people</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested in the church and church work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That may have been all true; but just the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same everybody said that Mr. Miller was</seg><seg type="columnLine">let go because he preached that sermon</seg><seg type="columnLine">about God bein' in everything, which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't mean except just as a person talks</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself He was dreamin' like Mitch</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he said it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Mr. Miller was goin' to Springfield</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see what he could do about gettin' to sell</seg><seg type="columnLine">books or maps or atlases, and quit preachin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">till a church turned up, or preach a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then, and marry folks when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could and preach at funerals. I heard Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller say to my pa that he was worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Mitch, that Mitch talked in his sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ground his teeth, and talked about</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines and horses and findin' pisols and</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure, and ridin' on steamboats, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Zueline and Tom Sawyer. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he'd tried to get him to go out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the farm with me and ride horses and get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">change, but he wouldn't. He just read</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shakespeare until they hid the book and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then they found him readin' Burns; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">once Ingersoll's Lectures, which they also</seg><seg type="columnLine">took away, because Mr. Miller thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mitch was too young.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About this time I was about a third</seg><seg type="columnLine">through readin' the Bible to earn that five</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars that grandma- had promised me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Mitch asked me what I thought, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said I didn't understand it much; but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts it was as wonderful as any book. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mitch says, "Do you know what the Bible</seg><seg type="columnLine">is?" "No," I says, "what is it?" "Why,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he says, "The Bible is the Tom Sawyer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown folks. I know that now; so I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to go through the trouble of findin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">it out after I'm grown up and depended</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it for a long while. There's the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the earth, and there are folks, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're more or less real to each other, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there's something back Of it. But I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve when you die, you're asleep--sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep--I almost know it. And why we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should wake up a bit and then go to sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever is more than my pa knows or any</seg><seg type="columnLine">person in the world knows."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mitch scared me with his talk. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so earnest and solemn and seemed so sure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One night when I was up to Mr. Miller's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came up somehow what we was goin' to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do when we was grown up--Mitch and me</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and Mrs. Miller thought we should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught something to earn a livin' by; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the schools instedW of teaching so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much, and teaching Latin and Greek, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody used, should teach practical things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Mr. Miller said, "Look out! That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cornin' fast enough; it's on us already. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the schools are the factories and</seg><seg type="columnLine">places that always want workers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they're already usin' the schools to turn out</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers, boys who don't know much, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys who know one thing. And it makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">no difference what happens to me--it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as much or more to know how to enjoy</seg><seg type="columnLine">life and to enjoy it, as it is to be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">earn a livin'. If you earn a livin' and don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how to enjoy life, you're as bad off</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if you know how to enjoy life, but can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a livin' or not much of one. Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, you boys: Anything that gives you</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure, like Greek and Latin, stories, his-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory, doin' things, whatever they are, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sake of livin', are worth while. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">you let yourselves go. And don't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">moulded into a tool for somebody's use,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lose your own individuality."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that's the way he talked. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said it was all right to dig for treasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we wanted to and to want to see the Mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sissippi River and see Tom Sawyer, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't blame us a bit for anything we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done. "Yes," he says, "I'll take you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Springfield to-morrow; ask your pa, Skeet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and come along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did; and the next morning we took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train for Springfield; and here was a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">town not as big as St. Louis, but awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">big. The capital was bigger'n any building</seg><seg type="columnLine">in St. Louis, with a great dome and a flag.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Mr. Miller took us out to see Lincoln's</seg><seg type="columnLine">monument. Just when we got there, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in over-alls came running from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the tomb and said a man--an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldier--had just killed himself with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife. So we ran around and found him</seg><seg type="columnLine">lyin' in a lot of blood. The men came back</seg><seg type="columnLine">12</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MITCH MILLER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">177</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and took a bottle of whisky out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket, and a writing which said that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prohibition party had been defeated, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it hadn't been he couldn't have got</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisky; and so he killed himself because</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prohibition party had been defeated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Mitch says, "What a fool idea! If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wanted the prohibition party defeated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why did he drink and buy whisky; and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he drank and carried whisky in his pocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why did he want the prohibition party to</seg><seg type="columnLine">win, and kill himself because it lost. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was crazy, wasn't he, pa?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Mr. Miller said, "Not necessarily--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's sense as things go in the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some people want whisky done away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">so they can't get it their own selves, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they can't get a law for that, it dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appoints 'em, and they keep on drinkin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">because they're disappointed, or kill them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves because their disappointment is too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much. For you can depend upon it that</seg><seg type="columnLine">any man that gets his mind too much fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on any idea, is like a cross-eyed man killin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">a steer with a sledge hammer; he must hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">whar he's lookin'. Lincoln had a way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">holdin' to an idea without the idea drag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gin' him down and away from everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">else."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had carried the dead man off so</seg><seg type="columnLine">we went into the tomb to see the curiosities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And there was more things than you could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see: All kinds of flags and framed things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures and writing and show cases with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistols, and all sorts of trinkets, bullets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knives; and a pair of spectacles which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lincoln had wore, and a piece of a rail he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had split, and books he'd read, and a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ribbon with his blood on it the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">he died, and a theatre program and lots of</seg><seg type="columnLine">other things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then we went out doors and looked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the monument, and it made me dizzy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the clouds sail over the top of it. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a figure of Lincoln in iron, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of soldiers in iron charging, and horses in</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron; besides mottoes cut in the stone and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in iron. Then we went around to the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">again where the old soldier had killed him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. Ttley had the blood wiped up now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So we looked through the iron bars where</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stone coffin was, but Lincoln wasn't in</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, Mr. Miller said. For once they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to steal him, and got the lead coffin</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, and clear down the hill that we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see; but they caught 'em. And after that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they dug way down and put Lincoln there,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and then poured mortar or concrete all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, clear up to the top; then laid the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and put this marble coffin there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was a dummy and had nothin' in it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So now nobody could get Lincoln forever</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then we came around in front again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mr. Miller looked up at the statue of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lincoln and began to study it) and he says:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I brought you boys to Springfield and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to learn and to get things into your</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. You'll remember this trip as long as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you live. It's the first time you've evet</seg><seg type="columnLine">been here, and you'll be here lots of times</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, maybe; but you'll always remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time. Now, just look at Lincoln's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and his body and tell me how any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body could see him and not see that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">different from other men. Look how his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face comes out in the bronze and becomes</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful, and then think if you can how</seg><seg type="columnLine">a handsome face would look in bronze--</seg><seg type="columnLine">just the difference between a wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff or mountain side, and a great, smooth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect boulder. And yet, boys, that man</seg><seg type="columnLine">went right around here for twenty years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yes and more, all around this town, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Petersburg, up at Old Salem, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the country, practicing law, walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the streets with people, talkin' with</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em on the corners, sittin' with 'em by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannon stove in the offices of the hotels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepin' in the same rooms with 'em as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did up at Petersburg at the Menard House,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the grand jury had the loft and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">put Lincoln up there too, because there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no other place to put him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Menard House," says Mitch, "do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you mean that hotel there now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The very same," said Mr. Miller,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"didn't you know that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," says Mitch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, that shows you; you're like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people who lived when Lincoln did, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know him, some of them; and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">you don't know the places he went to and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country he lived in; and you'd never</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone to Old Salem, if you hadn'l</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone there for treasure--would you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mitch?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mitch said he didn't knowj maybe not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Mr. Miller, "if you find</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lincoln while tryin' to dig up a few rotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars, it's all right anyway. Now, boys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">look here, it seems an awful time to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">since Washington lived, since the Govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment was founded--but it isn't. We're all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">romance 'feB -- - SjyBfflhean</seg><seg type="columnLine">178</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EDGAR LEE MASTERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">here together, and when j'ou get to be old</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, you'll see that you were bom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived in the beginning of the republic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How will it look hereafter? Do you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know--take a history and look at it</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Let's see! Washington had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">been dead ten years when Lincol# was</seg><seg type="columnLine">born; Lincoln had been dead eleven years</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you were born. When Lincoln was</seg><seg type="columnLine">born, the Government had been founded</seg><seg type="columnLine">just 23 years, was just a little more than of</seg><seg type="columnLine">age. It wasn't but just 80 years old when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lincoln became president. Why these</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures are nothing. Think about it. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">did Juvenal live? About 42 A. D. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">did Virgil and Horace live, and Caesar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Augustus and Domitrian? What does 40</seg><seg type="columnLine">years here or there mean when you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookin' back over hundreds of years or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand? And so I say, you boys were</seg><seg type="columnLine">born in the beginning of the republic not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred years after it was started, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if either of you ever get your names into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the history, there it will be beside Lincoln</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not far from Washington--for you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were bom 10 years after Lincoln died and</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not a hundred after Washington.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, there you are. You're young and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">republic is young, and the chance is before</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to do for the country and help out, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're havin' bad times now, and they'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be worse. After every war, times is bad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we're goin' to have other wars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse'n ever."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Mr. Miller said: "There's two</seg><seg type="columnLine">kinds of men--at least two. One that</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinks and one that acts; or one that tells</seg><seg type="columnLine">people what to do, and others that listen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and do it, or else have thought it out first</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves and do it. Well, look at Lin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coln up there. Here lffe was over at Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Salem running a store, surveyin'; then in</seg><seg type="columnLine">politics a little, then a lawyer; but mostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for twenty years he was thinkin' about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of the country, slavery and things;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he thought it all out. Then they</seg><seg type="columnLine">elected him president, and he acted out</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, don't you suppose he could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">got rich practicing law or tradin' in land?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a good lawyer--none better! Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't he get fees and save and buy land</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the twenty years h£ practiced law?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Because his mind was set on the country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on how to make the country better, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">being a shepherd of the people. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who thinks of money all the time, thinks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of himself; and the man who thinks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country and wants to help it is thinking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what can be done for people and how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country can find treasure in having better</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, and better laws, and better life</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more of it. Yes, sir, boys, you'll find</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere that Lincoln said his ambition</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be well thought of by his fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizens and to deserve to be'. And it never</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred to him that he could do that by</seg><seg type="columnLine">gettin' money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Don't you boys think I'm lecturin' you</seg><seg type="columnLine">for huntin' for treasure, or that I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">either of you to grow up and be as poor as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am. I don't. I want you to have sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">and provide for yourselves; Lincoln did</seg><seg type="columnLine">that; he really had plenty after he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly started. But on the other hand, gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">as gold I hate, and I see it getting power</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this country. Why, it has it now. Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Lincoln's face, what do you think ha'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of what's happened since the war--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the robbery, ruin and conquest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">south, the money grabbing and privilege</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbing at the north, the money deals in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York, the money scandals everywhere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the treasure hunting everywhere--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a big man left in the country; none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old, fine characters left who built their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives on foundations of wisdom and service</seg><seg type="columnLine">and makin' the country better--none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these left to come forward and take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country out of the hands of these vultures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolves, hyenas. And what are we going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have. Is money goin' to be the master in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this country, or is man goin' to be? I hate</seg><seg type="columnLine">it--I hate it as Lincoln hated it when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked whether the dollar or the man should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be put first. And I hate it because it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">brainless, spiritless. It cares for nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but itself. It is a snake that swallows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeps and wakes to eat again. It is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">despot; it is without love, genius, morality.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is against people, against God, against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country. It is as wicked as Nero, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">gluttonous as a cotmorant; and it makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowards, slaves, lick-spittles of some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best of men. In this country, intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be of free men, where men could grow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to the best that is in them, already we</seg><seg type="columnLine">find these laws and principles mocked--by</seg><seg type="columnLine">what? By gold, by riches; and we find</seg><seg type="columnLine">talented men and good men compelled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">step aside for rich men; and rich men held</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher than good and useful lawyers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">preachers or anything else. Well, there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lincoln: and if never again in the history</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROMANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">MITCH MILLER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of this country a rail-splitter, a boy who</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked up from nothing with his hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind, comes to rulership, still there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lincoln, on whom no rich man could frown</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no big-bellied capitalist could patronize</seg><seg type="columnLine">or ignore or make step aside. Why, it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">great--it makes me happy, it gives me</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope. And I can see for ages and ages the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of Lincoln on books, on coins, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">monuments; until some day his face will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the symbol of the United States of Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ica, when the United States of America has</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotted into the manure piles of history with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tyre and Babylon, as it will if it doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn back and be what Lincoln was: a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who worked and thought, and whose idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to have a free field, just laws, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">democracy where to make a man and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a dollar is the first consideration."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then Mr. Miller said: "Yes, this is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great monument and Lincoln was a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. You see when all the sap-heads and</seg><seg type="columnLine">poets down in New England and all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hollerin' for nigger equality and to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nigger a vote and to marry him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">give him the same right as anybody, Lin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coln just kept cool; and he didn't even</seg><seg type="columnLine">emancipate the nigger until he had to in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to win the war. It was to win the</seg><seg type="columnLine">war, understand. He wasn't swept off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet by anybody, orators or poets or yawp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers--nobody. But you'll see when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow up what the difference is between not</seg><seg type="columnLine">havin' the nigger for a slave and allowin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to vote and marry you; and you'll see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that what Lincoln said when he went over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country debatin' with Dquglas, speakin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Havana, and right here in Springfield</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at Petersburg, too, he said to the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">and acted on to the last. It was after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">war and after Lincoln was dead that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">here snifflers and scalawags got into power</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pushed it over until they gave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nigger the vote and all that. And if this</seg><seg type="columnLine">country goes to pieces because the good</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeds have been killed off and die off, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country is run by the riff-raff, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lincoln, say 500 years from now, will stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater than he is to-day, unless the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">can then see that the nigger should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been kept a slave, so as to let the wise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intelligent have time to think better</seg><seg type="columnLine">and work better for the good of the coun- -</seg><seg type="columnLine">try. For boys, you can put it down that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">country ain't good that is run on the prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciple of countin' noses, and lettin' every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body have a say just because he walks on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">two legs and can talk instead of bark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in' or waggin' his tail." And so Mr. Miller</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Miller said damn or that something-</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be "dammed." And Mitch says,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pa, did you know you swore?" And Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller says: "I shouldn't have, and don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you follow my example. But sometimes I</seg><seg type="columnLine">get so mad about&gt;the country."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So we had seen the monument and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked away; and when we got a long way</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it, we turned around and looked at it</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Mr. Miller said he was glad he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the church, that he had tried to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain things, but they wouldn't let him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kept him in a groove. And now he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to sell atlases and geographies, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a free man, and maybe write a book.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he said: "The idea seems to be that</seg><seg type="columnLine">goodness, spirituality, is church. It isn't,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it never was; it wasn't when the Savior</seg><seg type="columnLine">came; He found goodness and spirituality</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a lot of things, in a free life, in the free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom of out-doors, and not in the syna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gogues. Now boys, believe in the Bible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Savior--I mean that; but don't let</seg><seg type="columnLine">that belief make you into a membership</seg><seg type="columnLine">with those who live for denial, for obser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vation of injunctions, for abstinence from</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, more or less, for solemnity, for re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligion as business, and business as religion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and religion for husiness. This is not good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness--not spirituality. Lincoln was good</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spiritual--he believed in the mind and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he used it. Wisdom, beauty, play, adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, friendship, love, fights for the right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for your rights, travel, everything,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything that keeps the mind going; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindness, generosity, hospitality, laughter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trips down the Mississippi, making cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful and clean, having fun,--all these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things are spirituality and goodness. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are religion--they are the religion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savior. They will make America; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they ought to be Americanism."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Mr. Miller went on. I can't remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber half he said, but it was plain he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked up. Losin' his church or some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing had set his thoughts free; and every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing considered, I think he wanted to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">us some ideas about things. And so after</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookin' at Lincoln's home, a frame house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not very big, not fine, but a good house;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lookin' at the furniture and things he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had, we took the train back to Petersburg.</seg><seg type="columnLine">EDGAR LEE MASTERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXVIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I COULD see plainer and plainer that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was losin' Mitch. There was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about having this business together</seg><seg type="columnLine">of huntin' for treasure that kept us chums;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now that was over and if we didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get something else, where would we end</seg><seg type="columnLine">up? Mitch said that the trip to Spring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field had cured him of being mad at his pa</seg><seg type="columnLine">for takin' us to Hannibal to see Tom Saw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yer the butcher. And he said: "Suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">you was at Old Salem fishin' and you had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">can of worms for bait, or thought you had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you was really out of worms, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be better, to set there and think you</seg><seg type="columnLine">had bait and go on believin' that until you</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to catch fish and needed lots of bait</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found you hadn't none, or to find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">you hadn't none all of a sudden and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">go get some in time for the fishin' that got</seg><seg type="columnLine">good? And so, wasn't it better to find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Tom Sawyer didn't live and find it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly than to go along being fooled</seg><seg type="columnLine">until something serious happened, and be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fool to the end, and maybe lose some</seg><seg type="columnLine">good chance." What I wanted to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mitch was that our case was real, that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found treasure and would get it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christmas; but I had promised my pa I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't tell, and I didn't. I only said</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mitch: "We're just as sure to get treas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure as the sun shines." And Mitch said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Maybe, but not real treasure, not money,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not jewels, or things like that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I said, I was surely losin' Mitch, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was goin' considerable now with Charley</seg><seg type="columnLine">King and George Heigold. I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he found with them to like; only they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were older and as it turned out, he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">things wifh them that he and 1 never did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I tried my best to hold on to him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't. Sometimes I'd think I wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">losin' him, that it was just fancy. Just the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same things wasn't the same. The Miller</seg><seg type="columnLine">family wasn't the same; there wasn't as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much fun up there; and now Mr. Miller</seg><seg type="columnLine">was away a good deal selling atlases'; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes when I was there of evenings</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Miller would be sittin' alone, no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading to her, and the girls kind of walkin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rooms, and Mitch a good deal away of</seg><seg type="columnLine">evenings, not home like he always was</seg><seg type="columnLine">before;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You see I had a pony all the time; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">pa loaned him here and there, and some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times took him out to pasture across the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">river to a farmer's and that's how it was I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't ride him sometimes out to the farm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But now he was in the barn, and as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't have Mitch, I rode about the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">by myself. And once went out to the farm</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few hours, coinin' back to town in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallop all the way, to see how quick I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally I thought I'd go out to the farm</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my pony and stay for a few days, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">go camping with my uncle over to Blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lake. I was goin' the next day and was out</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the oak tree when Mitch came along.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He seemed stronger, bigger, more like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charley King and George Heigold; there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something about him kind of hard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He seemed as if he'd fight easier; he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick to talk back, he seemed to be learnin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">about things I didn't know. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">different look in his eyes. He was changed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's all I know. Mitch sat down in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass, and began to make traps out of tim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">othy lo catch crickets. Somebody had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught him that. His face began to change.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He began to look friendlier and like him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self again, except he looked older and like</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew more. And then he began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Skeet," he says, "I'm not Tom Sawyer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I never was; never any more than you</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Huckleberry Finn. I know who I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Do you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," says I. "Who are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'll tell you, Skeet--I'm Hamlet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hamlet--who was he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," says Mitch, "he was a prince."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you ain't," says I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I ain't. But Hamlet could be just</seg><seg type="columnLine">like me and not be the preacher's son; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he wasn't wouldn't make him dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent. Yes, sir, I'm Hamlet. I've read</seg><seg type="columnLine">the play and thought about it a lot. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know now who I am. And you, Skeet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are Horatio."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who was he?" says I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He was Hamlet's friend, just as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are my friend. And as far as that goes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was never any persons more alike in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this world than you and Horatio. You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">good and steady, and don't change, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are a good friend, you have got sense,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you have no troubles of your own, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so you can listen to mine, as Horatio lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened to Hamlet's."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What troubles have you?" says I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. "Lots," says Mitch, "that is general</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubles--of course Zueline and this here</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I.	. 1 ROMANCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">MITCH M</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">court worries.

He was get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting old, most 30, and he couldn't do any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more with his life than I can with mine--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not as much, maybe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And yet you say he was a prince."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, but what difference did that make?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Did you ever see a chip get caught in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little shallow in the river in the reeds; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then see it get out of the shallow by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current changing or something, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">see it start down the river all gay and free,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and run into some brush floating, or get</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown against the logs to one side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dam and held there? Well, Hamlet was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prince, and he was just a chip caught by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dam and couldn't budge and kept tryin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">to and couldn't. This is what my pa says</seg><seg type="columnLine">the play means; but also I can see it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself. I keep readin' it and it gets clearer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And pa says it will never make any differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence how old I get, the play will be won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derfuler and wonder fuler, and is to him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that finally I'll wonder how any man</seg><seg type="columnLine">could ever write such a thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But didn't Shakespeare--he wrote it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't he?--get it out of some history?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," says Mitch, "and didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lincoln live, and right here in this town,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you might say? But suppose somebody</seg><seg type="columnLine">could write up Lincoln and use the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">things that Lincoln did and said, not as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear 'em around here, wonderful as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are; but write 'em up so that you'd know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what Lincoln really was and why and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. For that matter, take Doc Lyon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We know he was a lunatic, but why, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what for, and just what it means to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunatic, I don't know and no one will know</seg><seg type="columnLine">until some Shakespeare writes him up. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">that matter, some folks think that Hamlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a lunatic."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you ain't, Mitch," says I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No more than Hamlet was.

Suppose I was their</seg><seg type="columnLine">son and was up in the tree and saw' what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw, what would I do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Then you'd have to testify," said I.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You don't know what you're sayin',</seg><seg type="columnLine">Skeet. You don't see that I love my father,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he's been murdered; and I love my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother, and she has really murdered him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And if I testify against my mother, I get</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hanged, and if I don't testify against</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, then I wrong my father that I love;</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mother goes free, and sometimes I hate</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, because she is free, and my father has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been robbed of his life, and I do nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to punish her and Temple Scott for taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life away. That's the worst of it; or</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe it's just as bad because I'm tangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in law and can't do what I want to do--</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't be free to hunt treasure, we'll say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or do what I want to. Don't you see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fix I'm in. Then suppose with findin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">out what my mother is, the whole world</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes for me--I get suspicious of my girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and won't marry her and everything goes</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad and finally I get killed myself, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">killin' Temple Scott who's married my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother, we'll say, and in a way cause my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother to die too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, of course all this can't be," says</seg><seg type="columnLine">I, "for you're not the Raineys' son;--</seg><seg type="columnLine">they're both dead anyway, and Temple</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott will probably be hanged, and no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">will kill you--you'll grow up and get mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried--not to Zueline-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," says Mitch, "never to her. For I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't suspicious of her--I'm just done with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, just like Hamlet was done with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ophelia. I know her as he knew Ophelia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though she's different from Ophelia. She's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold, Skeet, and never understood me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that now. If she had, she'd never let</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mother keep her away from me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothin' can keep a girl away from you that</seg><seg type="columnLine">loves you. And I'll tell you something</seg><seg type="columnLine">right now. Not long ago, I was walkin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">by her house on purpose and she came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin' somewhere. I tried to talk to her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tell her that we could meet sometimes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe down at Fillmore Springs, or take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little walk at dusk or early evening; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I wouldn't bother her much, only we'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand that by and by we'd get mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried and be together forever, and I'd go</seg><seg type="columnLine">away happy if I could have that hope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, she kind of turned on me and said</seg><seg type="columnLine">no, and hurried on. And, Skeet, when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that, when I saw that it was her as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as her ma that wanted me away, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant to keep away from me--something</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of froze through me--or burned may-</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, and then froze--my heart got like a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone, and I could see it just as if it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been scalt and then turned white and shiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kind of numb like my foot- I cut in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two. I began to laugh, and since then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been changed and I'll never be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same again. My ma said it was foolish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was just a little boy and I'd grow</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and it would all be forgotten. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know better--I'm Hamlet--and I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget and I never will. Do you remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">one time when you and I was out to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">grandpa's farm and Willie Wallace was</seg><seg type="columnLine">settin' out trees?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I said yes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," says Mitch, "Willie Wallace</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time cut a gash in a tree with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pruner while handlin' it and settin' it out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he says to us, 'That tree will never</seg><seg type="columnLine">get over that. By and by it will be a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">scar, growin' big as the tree grows big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grown over, maybe, but still a scar; or</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse, it may stay open more or less and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain and frost will get in, and insects, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after while it will be a great rotten place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hole for a snake or a rat, or maybe a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird.' Well, pa says that Linkern lost Anne</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rutledge and that he thinks Linkern's beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful talk and wonderful words came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">losin' Anne Rutledge. I don't quite see</seg><seg type="columnLine">how--but if it did, then if a bird gets into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hole in the tree, that's a sign that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say somethin' or write somethin' because</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've been gashed, just as pa says that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shakespeare wrote his wonderfulest plays</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sonnets because he'd lost a woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And sometimes I think I'm goin' to write</seg><seg type="columnLine">something. I keep hearin' music all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, and I try to write words down, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they don't mean anything, they are silly;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so 1 tear 'em up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Mitch went on and he worried me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I says; "Mitch, I'm goin' to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to you! Do you like me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as you used to?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Every bit," says he. "Why?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Because," says I, "you don't always act</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same. And besides, you keep goin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Charley King and George Heigold--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and--and-" &gt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"And what?" says Mitch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"And--I was afraid you liked 'em bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter'n me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why," says Mitch, "them two boys is</seg><seg type="columnLine">just grave diggers compared to you--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rosencrantz and Guilderstern--while you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are Horatio all the time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He explained to me what he meant by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, which was that in Hamlet, Ha ml at</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked to grave diggers and to two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Rosencrantz and Guilderstern,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without givin' a snap for 'em compared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horatio.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I said, "I'm goin' out to the farm</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-morrow. School will begin in about</seg><seg type="columnLine">three weeks. I'm goin' out on my pony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you can ride behind. And you'd bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter come. We'll have a lot of fun, and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle is goin' to take me campin' to Blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lake." So Mitch said he'd go and after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit he began to repeat something he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">committed to memory like this;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">O	what can ail thcc, knight at arms,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      Alone and palely loitering,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     The sedge is withered from the lake,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     And no birds sing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">0	what can ail thee, knight at arms,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">So haggard and so woe-begone,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      The squirrels' granary is full,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     And the harvest done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     1	met a lady in the mead</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     Full beautiful, a faery's child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     Her hair was long, her foot was light,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     And her eyes were wild.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     I saw pale kings and warriors too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      Pale princes, death pale were they all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     They said La Belle Dame Sans Merci</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     Hath. thee in thrall."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mitch was goin' on with this when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard some boys whistle. It was Charley</seg><seg type="columnLine">King and George Heigold. They called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mitch to the fence and talked. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mitch called back and said, "I'm goin',</seg><seg type="columnLine">Skeet--come for me--what time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll be up about 7," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And Mitch climbed over the fence, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went with these boys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I went up to the fence and follered them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my eyes till they turned the corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Harris' barn and was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXIX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NEXT morning I was on my pony</seg><seg type="columnLine">and up to Mitch's house at 7, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistled and whistled. By and by one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">M 1 TCH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the girls came out and said Mitch had staid</seg><seg type="columnLine">all night at Charley King's and wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">home yet. So I went over there; but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Charley was up and gone already. Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">King came to the door, came out and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the pony and petted him and said I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty eyes, same as before. Then she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charley and Mitch had gone somewhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She didn't know where. So I rode off and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode around a bit and then I started for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farm, thinkin' that Mitch had treated me</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean--and why would he for Rosencrantz</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Guilderstern? whichever Charley King</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. I was sure Mitch would turn up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next day grandpa was goin' to town</seg><seg type="columnLine">early to be home by three o'clock, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he'd bring Mitch out if he could find</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My uncle now was in a mood to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">camping to Blue Lake. So we got the tent</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and began to mend it where it needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and fix the ropes. We took the guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cleaned 'em, and I helped my uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">load a lot of shells. We set aside some pie</seg><seg type="columnLine">plates and cups and did a lot of tinkerin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. Grandma didn't want us to go.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was afraid we'd get drowned or shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves, or that a storm would come up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we'd get struck by lightning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the afternoon old Washington Engle</seg><seg type="columnLine">came and lie and grandpa sat under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">maple trees and talked old times, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Indians, for they had been in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black Hawk war together, and they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen the country grow from buffalo grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">to blue grass and clover. I sat there lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenin' and pretty soon a buggy pulled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and somebody called in a loud voice and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed. It was John Armstrong and Aunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caroline. They had drove over to visit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and John had brought his fiddle to play</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the old things for grandma--some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the things he had played year before</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Aunt Mary was sick and grandma</seg><seg type="columnLine">was takin' care of her. Grandpa liked</seg><seg type="columnLine">gospel tunes, like "Swing Lo, Sweet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chariot," but grandma liked "Rocky Road</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Jordan" and "The Speckled Hen" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">John could play these and couldn't play</seg><seg type="columnLine">religious tunes worth a cent. And John</seg><seg type="columnLine">told stories as before; and he told about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man at Oakford who never had any money</seg><seg type="columnLine">and always wanted drinks. So he took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jug and filled it half full of water and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Porky J im Thomas' saloon and asked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half a gallon of alcohol, and Porky Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured it in. Then this man said to Porky</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MILLER	&gt;8?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim, "Charge it, please," and Porky Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">says: "Why, you ain't got a cent, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">never pay anybody." So he took up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jug and poured out what he had poured in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and told the man to take the jug and go.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he did and had of course a half gallon</seg><seg type="columnLine">all mixed. John laughed terribly at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own story--the women didn't laugh, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">grandpa. My uncle did, and I, that's all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Aunt Caroline helped grandma get</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper and we had a lot of fun and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day grandpa started early for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Petersburg, so as to be back by three</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock for something. And my uncle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">me was getting ready, because we was goin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drive to Blue Lake that night, pitch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, and fish while it was quiet. So we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to grease the wagon and do a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. And grandpa was to bring Mitch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three o'clock looked like it never would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. But at last about three I saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white horses on the far hill, and then I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them pulling hard and slow up the near</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill and I could see grandpa now but</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't see Mitch; and I watched and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked. Then I thought he was hid under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seat; or had dropped off to walk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">come in later and fool me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grandpa drove in the lot. His face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">set. He looked serious. He didn't look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me. He held the lines and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight ahead. I climbed on the carriage</seg><seg type="columnLine">and says, "Where's Mitch?" Just then</seg><seg type="columnLine">my uncle came up to unhitch the horses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My grandpa threw him the lines and grand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pa got out of the carriage. Then he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking really to my uncle and not to me:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mitchie Miller was killed this afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the railroad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Grandpa," I cried, "Grandpa."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My grandfather's eyes were purple--</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had grown deep and almost terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see. And he said: "Yes, son," and hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried toward the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went to the barn. I saddled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridled my pony. I leaped into the saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and struck my heels into the pony's flanks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and away I went in a run all the way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Petersburg--six miles and not a pause or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">let up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I got there in a little more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">half an hour, I found that they had Mitch</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at the house of Widow Morris. So I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went there. He was still alive--and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">let me in. It was terrible. Such a smell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ether--medicines. Such whisperings--such</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">J ROMANCE L</seg><seg type="columnLine">EDGAR LEE MASTERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fulness in the room. The doctor said we'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to clear out, some of us. And some</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. I staid long enough to see Mitch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes were closed. His face was yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">--I could see blood. I turned siek and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out of the room. Just as I got to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door I heard Mitch say, "Has pa come?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">They said, "He's cornin' Mitchie, be</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient, he's cornin'." Then I stood by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And pretty soon Mrs. Miller came and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girls and my mother and Myrtle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">most everyone. It seemed Mr. Miller was</seg><seg type="columnLine">away selling atlases, but would be home</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon, maybe, or maybe not till late, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe not till to-morrow. All the girls</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried like their hearts would break; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Miller knelt down by the bed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mitch says to her "Where's pa?" And she</seg><seg type="columnLine">says, "He's coinin', Mitchie." And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she choked and had to walk away. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared the room now pretty much, and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course Mrs. Miller allowed me to be in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room if I wanted to, and could stand it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I stood by the door, or just inside a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little for Mitch was talkin'. Finally they</seg><seg type="columnLine">let me go to the bed-side, and Mitch saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and says, "Skeet," and then turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head kind of over as if he wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say something he couldn't bear to say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Mitch began to talk more. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">row so fast," he'd say--"The river's gettin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">swifter. Take the horses from that engine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm goin' to see Tom Sawyer--I can fly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him--fly--fly--fly--Zueline--it's you, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he kind of woke up and says: "Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zueline here?" And they said "No, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was cornin';" but she wasn't; she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of town, and probably wouldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">come anyway. And then he said-- "Get</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pa--he must forgive me before I die."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time I knew how Mitch was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt. He'd been with Charley King and</seg><seg type="columnLine">George Heigold, and they had been fiippin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the train. And Mitch was ridin' on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of a car with his foot hangin' down</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had cut in two, draggin' against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel, which he didn't notice because his</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot was numb from being cut in two when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was four or five years old. So the train</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a lurch and dragged him under, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wheels cut him at the hip. It couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be amputated by the doctor, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't slop the bleedin'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Mitch began to repeat all kinds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">poetry from Hamlet and things I didn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">know and he repeated what he had recited</seg><seg type="columnLine">tp me that day:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      I saw pale kings and warriors too,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      Pale princes, death pale were they all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     They said La Belle Dame Sans Merci</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     Hath thee in thrall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he talked about fly in', about treas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure, about St. Louis, about Doc. Lyon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe Rainey and the pistol; and once he</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked as if he thought he was testifyin' in</seg><seg type="columnLine">court; and he said-- "Now we're on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mississippi--how fast the boat goes--don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">run so fast." But always he'd come to and</seg><seg type="columnLine">say where's my pa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And after a bit there was a stir--Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller came--pushed his way through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was pale as ashes, all trembling, out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath, for he'd run up the hill. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the bedside, but Mitch was dream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing again, drifting and dreaming, and talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about boats, about money, about Ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let, about treasure, about pale kings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors and death pale princes. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty soon he says, "Where's my pa? Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">he never cornin'?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm here," said Mr. Miller.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mitch opened his eyes and looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his father for about a minute and saw his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pa had come. He was pretty weak now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was hard for him to speak. JBut finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "Take my hand--pa*." And Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller took it. And then nothin' was said</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a while. And then Mitch spoke again--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Forgive me, pa." And Mr. Miller, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tryin' to keep from cryin' so as not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry Mitch, says,' "Oh yes, Mitchie."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then Mitch says: "Say a little prayer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pa." And Mr. Miller knelt by the bed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say a prayer, and Mitch says-- "Not out</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud--just to yourself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Mr. Miller did, and then Mitch wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered again and he says, "Don't row so</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast." Then there was a terrible stillness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mitch had died with them words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And my friend--my chum, was gone for</seg><seg type="columnLine">good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND then there was the funeral. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was held at Mr. Miller's house and</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody was there; my grandpa, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">grandma,' my uncle, John Armstrong and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aunt Caroline, Willie Wallace, Col. Lamb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kin, Nigger Dick, Dinah, my ma and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Myrtle, all the Sunday School children, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">MITC H</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">George Montgomery. Only Charley King</seg><seg type="columnLine">and George Heigold wasn't there. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were afraid, bein' partly responsible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mitch's death. And when everybody was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated and ready, Zueline and her ma came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They was all dressed up, and everybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at 'em. Mr. Miller, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't preach the sermon for his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy; so they sent for a wonderful preacher</seg><seg type="columnLine">over at Jacksonville and he talked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">about an hour about pearly gates and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden streets of paradise; and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mitch lyin' there, pale, his eyes sealed, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep, but in such a deep breathless sleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And they had the church choir there which</seg><seg type="columnLine">sang:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I will sing you a song of that beautiful land,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Of the far away home of the soul,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Where no storms ever beat on that glittering</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    strand,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">While the years of eternity roll."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the minister went on to say how</seg><seg type="columnLine">good God was, how no sparrow falls except</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knows it, how all our hairs was num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered and how God loves us, and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort the father and mother and brothers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sisters, and little .friends; and how if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it hadn't been for the best, Mitch wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have died; and that God knew best and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we didn't; and if we could look ahead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the dreadful things that would happen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'd know that God was good and wise to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take Mitch away before they happened--</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he was yet a boy, and had had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble and all the world was still beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful to him. And he talked about sin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what suffering does for people, how it</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes 'em humble before God, and respect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful and at last saves 'em if they will heed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lessons and turn to God. Everybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried when the last song was sung, espe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially the children who sobbed out loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mr. Miller and Mrs. Mitterrand the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mifler children--and I looked over at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zueline and her ma. Her ma was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookin' down. I thought I saw a tear in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zueline's eyes, but I'm not sure. So we</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out to the cemetery and they buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mitch not far from Little Billie. So it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over. We began to separate and get</seg><seg type="columnLine">into carriages or walk. And pretty soon I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was home. Thare was nothing there. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">ma went in and began to do something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Myrtle went out to the swing. I went in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house but couldn't stand it, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out and hung on the gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MILLER	185</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a bit Charley King came along and</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked me about everything. Pa said Mitch</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been running with Charley King and</seg><seg type="columnLine">George Heigold, and they got him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">things too much for his age, flippin' cars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and such things, and that's how Mitch lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life. You see I'd been scared about</seg><seg type="columnLine">this; I didn't want Mitch to go with 'em;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I didn't know why; but now it was clear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And with everything else, it was Sunday,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Mitch had died Friday, four or five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours after he was run over. And it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a week now till School would take up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day I went down to the office</seg><seg type="columnLine">with pa. I wanted to be close to him; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a man; he was strong, and I was lone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some and grievin', and at night always</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamin' of Mitch. And after a while Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller came in, and Mrs. Miller too. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked terrible sad and pale. Here was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Miller out of a church and not makin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">much, and here they had lost their only</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So pa went over to his safe and got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">$1,000; he had it in two envelopes, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked with my name and one with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mitch's; and he came back, holdin' 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand and he said: "You know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">these boys found that money that belonged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to old Nancy Allen. Well, a fellow named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe Allen turned up here from Pike County</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a third cousin of hers--and her only liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in' relative, and I had this money for him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But when I told him that these boys had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it while lookin' for treasure, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what kind of boys they were, the old fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered his own boy-hood, his'poverty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all that and he wanted to do something</seg><seg type="columnLine">for these boys. So he made me take this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars to divide between 'em."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Miller began to sob. And Mr. Mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler's voice was broken, but he said, "Hard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I never heard anything like this--never in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my life.'-' "Well, here's the money," says</seg><seg type="columnLine">pa; "and I made Skeet promise not to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">anybody about it until we got ready to."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stopped; and I, not thinkin', said: "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be a secret till Christmas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Mrs. Miller broke down com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely, and for several minutes nothin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">was said. My pa was cryin', so was I.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So was Mr. Miller, and just then the train</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in, the same that had killed Mitch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it semed like none of us could stand it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a bit pa says: "Of course, half</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this money goes to you and Mrs. Miller</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the law, and the other half belongs</seg><seg type="columnLine">EDGAR LEE MASTERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to Sk#et--but I'm not going to let him take</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. He doesn't need it. I can always take</seg><seg type="columnLine">care of him, and I'll inherit quite a lot, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'll have that. And as far as that goes, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't his idea to hunt for treasure--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just a helper and followed up Mitchie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea. So now here it is, and it goes with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">blessing and with Skeet's."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I said, "Indeed it does." And pa</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed the envelopes to Mr. Miller, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took 'em and fingered 'em in a nervous way</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he says: "What shall we do, ma--we</seg><seg type="columnLine">need the money, but somehow I don't like</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and I won't take Skeet's share, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And she says, "No--never--I'd never</seg><seg type="columnLine">take Skeet's share; that is Mitchie's share</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his too." "Here," he says, "here's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">envelope marked with Mitchie's name, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">take this, Skeet, because you and Mitchie</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked together, and if you want to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">me the envelope marked with your name, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess I'll take it--I seem to have to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So that's the way it was done. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to pa: "Hard, there never was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">better man than you, or a better name or</seg><seg type="columnLine">family than yours, or a better boy than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Skeet." Then the tears came in his eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he and Mrs. Miller left. And after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards I said to pa, "I don't want this</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. If I could have had it with Mitch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we could have spent it together for veloci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedes--and dogs, and sets of tools, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">scroll saws, watches and whatever we</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted, and soda water, when we Wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and bananas, which we never had much</seg><seg type="columnLine">because they cost ten cents a piece--for</seg><seg type="columnLine">amfthing, that would have been different.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But now it's just so much rags or paper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I haven't got any use for it whatever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am Huck Finn at last--the money means</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to me. It meant nothing to Huck</seg><seg type="columnLine">because when he got it, he had to put on</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes and dress up. And now I've got it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've lost the only thing that made it worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">while. I've lost Mitch who made it inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">estin' to get, and would have made it in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terestin' to spend."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I told pa I wanted to give it to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller girls, barrin' just a few dollars to</seg><seg type="columnLine">buy a present for ma and grandma and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Myrtle, maybe--and I wanted them to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to put up a stone at Mitch's grave</seg><seg type="columnLine">with some words on it, suitable to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. So pa said he thought that was all right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I took out $20 and we put the rest in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank in the names of the Miller girls--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that ended the treasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So next Monday school commenced, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sat in my seat lookin' out of the window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zueline had been taken to a girl's school in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Springfield so as to get her out of the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon schools and her mother had gone with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to stay all winter. And every day the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train came through that Mitch was killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. The days went by; the fall went by;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the winter came. The snow began to fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Mitch's grave and Little Billie's; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">still we went on. Delia got the meals as</seg><seg type="columnLine">before; the wash woman came and did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">washing on Monday; pa was buying wood</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the stoves; we had to be fitted out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">winter. Grandma and grandpa came in to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see us, cheerful and kind as they always</seg><seg type="columnLine">were. Once he carried a half a pig up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill and brought it to us; and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">always giving us things; and grandma was</seg><seg type="columnLine">always knitting me mittens and socks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had lost a lot of children, two little</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls the same summer, a daughter who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown, a grown son who was drowned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They seemed to take Mitchie's death and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Little Billie's death as natural and to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood. And they said it wouldn't be long</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we'd all be together never to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">separated and then we'd all be really</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And finally the December court came</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and they tried Temple Scott. Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Carman testified to what he had said</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the woman on the boat. And Major</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abbott was kerflumxed and lost the case.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Temple Scott got 14 years in prison--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ended that. He went there and staid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then Christmas came and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening I went up to the Millers'. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls were playing about the same as be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore. Mr. Miller was reading Shakespeare</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mrs. Miller and he looked up finally and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "Ma, I've just thought of an epitaph</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Mitchie's stone--here it is in Hamlet:</seg><seg type="columnLine">'The rest is silence.' " And Mrs. Miller</seg><seg type="columnLine">said yes and put her knitting down to count</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitches. The girls rushed into the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing and chasing each other. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I went home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had presents, but what were presents?</seg><seg type="columnLine">My chum was gone.

I sit here, dipping my nose in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gascon wine, so to speak, as Thackeray</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrote of himself; and I know now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mitch was a poet. He would have made</seg><seg type="columnLine">poems out of his life and mine, beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">songs of this country, of Illinois, of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people we knew, of the honest, kindly men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women we knew; the sweet-faced old</seg><seg type="columnLine">women who were born in Kentucky or Ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessee, or came here to Illinois early in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth; the strong, courtly, old fashioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, carrying with them the early traditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the republic, in their way, Lincolns--</seg><seg type="columnLine">honest, truth telling, industrious, courageous</seg><seg type="columnLine">Americans--plain and unlettered, many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, but full of the sterling virtues. Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have written poems out of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">people; and he would have done something</seg><seg type="columnLine">more--he would have given us symbols,</seg><seg type="columnLine">songs of eternal truth, of unutterable</seg><seg type="columnLine">magic and profound meaning like "La Belle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dame Sans Merci." I am sure he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done something of this kind--though</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is idle to say he would have written any-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thing as immortal as that. You must only</seg><seg type="columnLine">indulge me in my partiality for Mitch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my belief in his genius, and hope with me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he might have done these great things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet!

I had been out for the eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, I had found a book lying on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table of my host, I had looked in the book</seg><seg type="columnLine">and begun to read. My host saw I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">intrigued and said, "Take it along." I did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was reading before going to bed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">book was the letters of John Keats to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fanny Brawne- Well, don't you sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose these letters made me think of Mitch</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had repeated "La Belle Dame Sans</seg><seg type="columnLine">Merci" to me and was uttering some of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous lines with his dying breath?</seg><seg type="columnLine">But this was not all.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have seen his country go forth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">free an island people, and then turn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">subjugate another island people as a part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the same war, and then depart from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old ways i^to paths of world adventure and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunder.

Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">many another great man he was misunderstood</seg><seg type="columnLine">by some of the petty government officials of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">country who wished to mold the people to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">puny outlook on life and was compelled to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon after attaining early manhood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He became a wanderer through the lands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">South America and first came into international</seg><seg type="columnLine">prominence by the publication of a book of prose</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he called "Azul," after Victor Hugo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">motto, "L'art, e'est I'azurl" Juan Valera, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous Spanish critic, was very severe in his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">criticism, claiming that Dario should have given</seg><seg type="columnLine">more time to the teaching of correct Spanish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was especially hostile to the title, wanting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know why was art blue rather than yellow, red,</seg><seg type="columnLine">green or plain white or black. It was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">book, but Don Juan, stern realist, was unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see it. Dario proved that he had his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the pulse of Youth by revolutionizing Spanish</seg><seg type="columnLine">literature, heading w'hat is known as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">modernista movement, which spread to all Span-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish-speaking lands of the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He resided, at some time or other, in all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Latin-American countries and later spent some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in Europe. He is as well known to readers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Spanish as Shakespeare is to readers of English.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I remember seeing him in Buenos Aires several</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago, a great broad-shouldered man with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">placid face and large brown eyes beneath an</seg><seg type="columnLine">expanse of forehead, such a peculiar, striking ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance of face and figure as to cause me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember it today. He was possibly a straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">descendant from the royal races that inhabited</seg><seg type="columnLine">Central America before the conquest, races that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were enjoying the highest type of civilization</seg><seg type="columnLine">when men of Europe were living in caves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting with stone axes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In all of his works he teaches the compelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of the desire for the Ideal. This Ideal he</seg><seg type="columnLine">compares to the Veto de la Reina Mab, the Veil</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Queen Mab, a veil of opalescent blue made of</seg><seg type="columnLine">filmy gauze. He illustrates this by showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Queen Mab coming to four gaunt, unshaven men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a garret--a sculptor, a painter, a poet and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">musician. They are lamenting the sordidness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brutality of life. She alights from her car, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a single pearl, and twines them in the folds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her veil. Their sighs and groans are turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter as they glimpse the world as it now</seg><seg type="columnLine">appears to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In other words Life is as you look upon it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adolescent Youth sees it full of promise, Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Age views it with a tinge of bitterness, it gives</seg><seg type="columnLine">back the image that is thrown from the mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Romance?

And then there will a</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular mob rise up and tell him there is. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">me it represents the Veil of Queen Mab. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">also a very stern realist like Don Juan Valera,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I now and then try to clutch a comer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Veil and peer at things as they should be--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ideal state to which we will evolve as human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings within the next several thousand years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Edgar Young.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JAPAN--the old Japan--will never</seg><seg type="columnLine">cease to be a source of romance.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A blush burned my face, for I knew then</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Miss Miller had overheard what Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry had said to me about her a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes earlier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^ "Oh. you shouldn't be too severe on Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry.--she's such a fearfully thoughtless</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature. Nine tenths of the things she</seg><seg type="columnLine">says are said without thinking."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Miss Miller dried her eyes and talked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden firmness. "This thing that she's</seg><seg type="columnLine">said now is the one-tenth that she's thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. I am an 'ugly duckling.' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then, without further ado. she took her hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went away. Mr. Peck told us later that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had found a better position. So she told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. but I knew better: her self-respect would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not permit her to remain among us longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I suffered the most intense shock of my life</seg><seg type="columnLine">about four months later. I met the "ugly</seg><seg type="columnLine">duckling" at an engagement reception. 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked and looked. The realization of the fact that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">race to face with the Miss Miller I had once worked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">was painfully difficult. When the last vestige of doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared. I could only stand spellbound and give utter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance to a long astonished "0-o-o-o-oh!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> F&lt;t the "ugly duckling'' was no loneer an "ugly duck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling." Anybody, even Miss Terry, who used never to tire</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ridiculing her at the office, would have called Miss Miller</seg><seg type="columnLine">a beauty now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "How did you do it?" I gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She answered with a simple sincerity. "I am not going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pretend that I don't know what you're talking about."</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said. "You want to know what became of the 'tiglv</seg><seg type="columnLine">duckling. "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I laughed off my embarrassment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fashion Academy." she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fashion Academy?" I asked. I saw no connection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. rashion Academy helped me out just after I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made up my mind to stop being an 'uglv duckling.* I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard about rashion Academy from a friend. I turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">i'. in my hour of humiliation because I had the vague feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that somehow a good part of the ugliness of all 'ugly duck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lings' is in the feathers. 'Fine feathers make fine birds.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">they say. To make a lonp story short. I enrolled for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fashion Academy courses in Costume and Millinerv</seg><seg type="columnLine">Design.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not much more than a month later. I was designing</seg><seg type="columnLine">dresse-- and hats for myself that made me--I must say it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful. I learned that I had been dressing the wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">way all my life. I learned how much clothes may mean to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman. In short. 1 learned ho:, lo dress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I learned that every woman's figure is an individual</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, that every woman's personality is something apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all other personalities.

I learned to se.it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">colors to my complexion ami the coloring of my eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair. I learned how to express my personality in dress.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In other words.

I began to think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">J. too. had been more of an "ugly duckling"</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I need have been. "What." I thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"would charming, original dresses and hats</seg><seg type="columnLine">designed just for me do for my appearance?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then 1 said to Miss Miller. "But I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose the learning was terribly hard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She smiled. "That's quite the most re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markable thing about it." she replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Learning a Fashion Academy home-study</seg><seg type="columnLine">course is more like play than like work.

It's so</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant to be able to improve oneself right</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the comfort of one's own home. Besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, a home-study course costs only</seg><seg type="columnLine">about one-fourth the price of the course</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken right at the school."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	****«•</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So ended the "ugly duckling's" story of how</seg><seg type="columnLine">she stopped being an "ugly duckling."

I have only done</seg><seg type="columnLine">three lessons so far. but already I have made</seg><seg type="columnLine">great progress.
