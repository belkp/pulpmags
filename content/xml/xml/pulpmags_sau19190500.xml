                    <ab>THERE is an unusually interesting novelette next month by Elizabeth Walsh called MISS BROAD- WAY OF NOWHERE. It is the story
                        of Nat Seccombe, open-handed, young, rich, unscrupulous and popular. Baby Morrison, the latest beauty on the theatrical
                        firmament, who is twenty but looks sixteen, plays a leading part in this gripping novel; but the best is reserved for Lois,
                        who is almost run down by the young millionaire's car. He determines to take her to the big banquet he is giving to his
                        friends. Against her will she is dragged in to the brilliant scene and introduced as MISS BROAD- WAY OF NOWHERE. What happens
                        to her, the love that is made to her by the wrong and the right sort of men, the jealousy of the better known beauties, is
                        told in such a manner as to hold one's interest to the last sentence.</ab>
                    <ab>NEXT month we shall begin a series of unusual stories called THE MAN WHOM LIFE PASSED BY. Winson Bouve is the author and the
                        first of the series is A DAUGHTER OF JOY. The man whom life has passed by is a rich, lonely cripple who because of his
                        affliction has awakened love in no woman's heart. He lives alone in a big house, rarely going out except at night. It was on
                        one of these rambles he meets the woman whose pity he is able to buy.</ab>
                    <ab>THE WISE GUY, by Dayton Stoddart, is the amusing story of Jimmy Tilford who belonged to the class which always has a large
                        waiting list. A wise guy is one who falls twice as hard and fast as the rest. Jimmy regarded girls as pleasant playthings to
                        pass on to the next when their mission so far as he was concerned was done. Jimmy fell fast and hard as you will find
                        out.</ab>
                    <ab>HOME TOWN STUFF is a most entertaining story. It is about Patsy of the Gaiety and William Walker Jackson, who sent his card to
                        her dressing room by a stage hand. "Did he say he was a friend of mine?" she asked. "Yeh," said the stage hand, "said he was
                        from your home town--Boobville, I think he said." Out of this usual beginning an unusual and amusing story grows. Carolina
                        Jewett wrote it.</ab>
                    <ab>Other stories will be by Harold de Polo, C. S. Montanve, Murray Leinster, and Thomas Edgelow, all of whom are old
                        favorites.</ab>

                        <ab>My method of teaching music by mail--in your spare time at home, with no strangers around to embarrass you--makes it amaz-
                            ingly easy to learn to sing by note or to play any instrument. You don't need to know the first thing about music to
                            begin-- don't need to know one note from another. My method takes out all the hard part--overcomes all tho
                            difficulties--makes your prog- ress easy, rapid and sure.</ab>
                        <ab>Whether for an advanced pupil or a beginner, my method is a revolutionary improvement over the old methods used by

                        <ab>teachers. The lessons I send you explain every point and show every step in simple Print-and-Picture form that you can't
                            go wrong on--every step is made as clear as A B C.</ab>
                        <ab>My method is as thorough as it is easy. I teach you the only right way--teach you to play or sing by note. No "trick"
                            music, no "numbers." no makeshifts of any kind.</ab>
                        <ab>I call my method "new" simply because it is so radically dif- ferent from the old and hard-to-understand ways of teaching
                            music. But my method Is thoroughly time-tried and proven. Over 225,000 successful pupils--from boys and girls of 7 and 8 to
                            men and women of 70--are the proof.</ab>
                        <ab>Largely through the recommendations of satisfied pupils. I have built up the largest school of music in the world.</ab>
                        <ab>To prove what I say, you can take any course on trial--singing or any instrument you prefer--and judge entirely by your own
                            progress. If for any reason you are not satisfied with the course or with what you learn from it, then it won't cost you a
                            single penny. I guarantee satisfaction. On the other hand, if you are pleased with the course, the total cost amounts to
                            only a few cents a lesson, with your music and everything also included. When learning to play or sing is so easy, why
                            continue to confine your enjoyment of music to mere listening? Why not at least let me send you my free book that tells
                            you all about my methods. I know you will find this book absorbingly interesting, simply because it shows you how easy it
                            is to turn your wish to play or sing into an actual fact. Just now, I am making a special short- time offer that cuts the
                            cost per lesson in two- send your name now, before this special offer is withdrawn. No obligation- simply use the coupon

                            to gather daisies, and carry milk in, and feed the chickens." She broke off with a little laugh that held a note of
                            weariness in it. "I thought you were from out of town and lonely, too, that's why I joined you."</ab>

                        the business and political life of the country to- day. Living in the open, eating coarse foods and leading regular lives have
                        made blood rich in iron for these strong, healthy, vigor- ous specimens of manhood. But no such opportunity for building up
                        their health is open to thousands of men and women in civil life whose wearing tasks and iron- impoverished food sap their
                        energy and make them weak, anaemic and run-down and often cause their blood to literally starve for want of iron.</ab>
                    <ab>In commenting upon the probability of build- ing up a stronger race of people by increasing the supply of iron in their blood,
                        Dr. George H. Baker, formerly Physician and Surgeon, Mon- mouth Memorial Hospital of New Jersey, says: "Iron is absolutely
                        necessary to change food into living tissue, muscle and brain. Without iron there can be no strong, red-blooded men or
                        healthy, rosy-cheeked women, and unless this strength- giving iron is obtained from the food we eat it must be supplied in

                    <ab>If you are not strong or well you owe it to yourself to make the following test: See how long you can work or how far you can
                        walk with- out becoming tired. Next take two five-grain tablets of ordinary Nuxated Iron three times per day after meals for
                        two weeks. Then test your strength again and see how much you have gained.</ab>
                    <ab>MANUFACTURERS' NOTE: Nuxated Iron, which is pro-scribed and recommended above, is not a secret remedy but one which is well
                        known to druggists everywhere. Unlike the older inorganic iron products, it is easily as-similated and does not injure the
                        teeth, make them black, nor upset the stomach. The manufacturers guarantee suc-cessful and entirely satisfactory results to
                        every purchaser or they will refund your money. It is dispensed by all good druggists.</ab>
