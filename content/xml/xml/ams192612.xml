The author of ‘‘Beyond the Pole” </p><p>and “Through the Crater’s Rim” has written what </p><p>is, to our mind, a real masterpiece.

We wish to state at this</p><p> point that at present the magazine is not in the market</p><p> for full length novels, because the editors have a great many</p><p> on hand that await publication. They do, however, want</p><p> short stories under 10,000 words, stories that would occupy</p><p> nine or ten pages in AMAZING STORIES.</p><p> Furthermore, we receive an increasing number of letters,</p><p> asking if we are in the market for short stories, and to these</p><p> we wish to reply in the affirmative. We can not get too</p><p> many real short scientifiction stories. To encourage this, we</p><p> arc starting a rather unique</p><p> contest this month.</p><p> We have composed on our ||</p><p> front cover a picture which ll</p><p> illustrates a story to be writ- ||</p><p> ten by our readers. We are |!</p><p>$500.00 IN PRIZES |I </p><p> The following cash prizes will be awarded, 1]</p><p> frank to say that we haven’t !j ancj wju be paid for on publication of the prize- II</p><p> the slightest idea what the || winnin„ stories jn AMAZING STORIES: ii</p><p> picture is supposed to show.</p><p> The editors’ ideas pertain-</p><p> ing to the real solution,—</p><p> if one there be, — based up-</p><p> on the picture, are neces-</p><p> sarily vague.</p><p> There is for instance the</p><p> strange racc of people which</p><p> you see in the left fore-</p><p> ground, while in the distance</p><p> there is an equally strange city which may or may not Ik- on</p><p> this planet, and there is the still stranger ball-like machine</p><p> floating in space which apparently has captured a modern</p><p> ocean greyhound in some amazing manner. What is going</p><p> to happen to the ocean liner is the great secret. Docs the</p><p> ocean liner contain human beings, or have they been left</p><p> behind? What force has lifted the steamship into space, in</p><p> this incredible way, and where is it being transported? All</p><p> these are vital questions that all of us should like to have</p><p> answered.</p><p> Now. some one of our readers is going to write a real</p><p> short story of less than 10,000 words, around this picture.</p><p> He is going to study the picture from all perspectives and,</p><p> knowing a bit about science, he will not have much trouble</p><p> writing a most convincing story. We know it will be so</p><p> convincing that we will actually believe it. And the author</p><p> who is going to write the best story will be a good observer,</p><p> because he will miss no detail of the picture, and will take</p><p> cognizance of even the smallest detail.</p><p> It is in the very nature of this contest that there can not</p><p>First Prize...........................$250.00 </p><p>Second Prize........................ 150.00 </p><p>Third Prize ......................... 100.00 </p><p> The stories will appear in subsequent is-</p><p> sues in their correct order of merit.</p><p> be a great many prize winners. The editors have limited</p><p> the prizes to three, and only three stories will be chosen, and</p><p> only three will be printed. The reading of the three prize-</p><p> wiruiing stories will, we know be most interesting, because</p><p> each will very likely be entirely different in plot and in</p><p> treatment</p><p> Here, then, is a great chance for you to becomc an author.</p><p> It is a great opportunity to try your hand in an imaginative</p><p> story of Uie scicntifiction type.

That, too, was a strange </p><p>business; we two men floating loose in that spherical space, and packing and pulling ropes. No up or down, and every effort resulting </p><p>in unexpected movements. </p><p>THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON </p><p>775 </p><p>CHAPTER I </p><p>Mr. Bedford Meets Mr. Cavor at Lympne </p><p>S I sit down to write here amidst the </p><p>shadows of vine-leaves under the blue </p><p>sky of southern Italy, it comes to me </p><p>with a certain quality of astonishment </p><p>that my participation in these amaz- </p><p>ing adventures of Mr. Cavor was, after all, </p><p>the outcome of the purest accident. It might have </p><p>been any one. I fell into these things at a time </p><p>when I thought myself removed from the slightest </p><p>possibility of disturbing experiences. I had gone to </p><p>Lympne because I had imagined it the most unevent- </p><p>ful place in the world. “Here, at any rate,” said </p><p>I, “I shall find peace and a chance to work!” </p><p> And this book is the sequel. So utterly at vari-</p><p>ance is Destiny with all the little plans of men. </p><p> I may perhaps mention here that very recently I</p><p>had come an ugly cropper in certain business enter- </p><p>prises. Sitting now surrounded by all the circum- </p><p>stances of wealth, there is a luxury in admitting my </p><p>extremity, I can admit, even, that to a certain ex- </p><p>tent my disasters were conceivably of my own mak- </p><p>ing. It may be there are directions in which I </p><p>have some capacity, but the conduct of business </p><p>operations is not among </p><p>these. But in those days </p><p>I was young, and my </p><p>youth among other ob- </p><p>jectionable forms took </p><p>that of a pride in my </p><p>capacity for affairs. I </p><p>am young still in years, </p><p>but the things that have </p><p>happened to me have rub- </p><p>bed something of the </p><p>youth from my mind. </p><p>Whether they have </p><p>brought any wisdom to </p><p>light below it is a more </p><p>doubtful matter. </p><p> It is scarcely necessary</p><p>to go into the details of </p><p>the speculations that </p><p>landed me at Lympne, in </p><p>Kent. Nowadays even </p><p>about business trans- </p><p>actions there is a strong </p><p>spice of adventure. I took </p><p>risks. In these things _ </p><p>there is invariably a cer- IBBMBMBHBreSBSMMMBa </p><p>tain amount of give and </p><p>take, and it fell to me finally to do the giving. </p><p>Reluctantly enough. Even when I had got out </p><p>of everything, one cantankerous creditor saw fit </p><p>to be malignant. Perhaps you have met that flam- </p><p>ing sense of outraged virtue, or perhaps you have </p><p>only felt it. He ran me hard. It seemed to me, at </p><p>last, that there was nothing for it but to write a </p><p>play, unless I wanted to drudge for my living as a </p><p>clerk. I have a certain imagination, and luxurious </p><p>tastes, and I meant to make a vigorous fight for </p><p>it before that fate overtook me. In addition to my </p><p>belief in my powers as a business man, I had always </p><p> I3ESIDES being one of his masterpieces, this amazing</p><p> story, by H. G. Wells, is undoubtedly one of the</p><p> greatest moon talcs of adventure ever written. For ages</p><p> speculation has been rife as to what sort of creatures the</p><p> moon could harbor. IVe of today know that the</p><p> moon has no atmosphere, at least not on the surface. We</p><p> know the moon to be a dead world, having long cooled</p><p> down, its volcanic activities stopped long before the first</p><p> living creature crazvled upon this earth.</p><p> The moon, therefore, must be a dead world—so our</p><p> scientists now argue. That means that its interior prob-</p><p> ably contains enormous grottoes and caves, such as are</p><p> not found in our world. It is possible, therefore, that</p><p> remnants of a long-vanished atmosphere of the moon</p><p> will be found in the interior of that planet, making</p><p> it highly probable for some sort of organism to carry on</p><p> an existence there.</p><p> What grotesque form such organisms have taken on</p><p> during the ages it is impossible to definitely affirm. One</p><p> man’s guess is as good as another’s. But somehow H. G.</p><p> Wells, in this story, probably comes as close to the truth</p><p> as any one can. And the story is written so convincingly,</p><p> that instead of gaining the impression that yau arc read-</p><p> ing fiction, you sense, rather, that you are reading a true</p><p> exploration tale.</p><p> We know that you will follow the developments in this</p><p> story with breathless interest.</p><p>in those days had an idea that I was equal to </p><p>writing a very good play. It is not, I believe, a </p><p>very uncommon persuasion. I knew there is noth- </p><p>ing a man can do outside legitimate business trans- </p><p>actions that has such opulent possibilities, and </p><p>very probably that biased my opinion. I had, in- </p><p>deed, got into the habit of regarding this unwritten </p><p>drama as a convenient little reserve put by for a </p><p>rainy day. That rainy day had come, and I set to</p><p>work. </p><p> I soon discovered that writing a play was a longer</p><p>business than I had supposed; at first I had reckon- </p><p>ed ten days for it, and it was to have a 'pied-b-terre </p><p>while it was in hand, that I came to Lympne. I </p><p>reckoned myself lucky in getting that little bunga- </p><p>low. I got it on a three years’ agreement. I put </p><p>in a few sticks of furniture, and while the play </p><p>was in hand I did my own cooking. My cooking </p><p>would have shocked Mrs. Bond. And yet, you </p><p>know, it had flavour. I had a coffee-pot, a sauce- </p><p>pan for eggs, and one for potatoes, and a frying </p><p>pan for sausages and bacon—such was the simple </p><p>apparatus of my comfort. One cannot always be </p><p>magnificent, but simplicity is always a possible </p><p>alternative. For the rest I laid in an eighteen- </p><p>gallon cask of beer on credit, and a trustful baker </p><p>came each day. It was not, perhaps, in the style </p><p>of Sybaris, but I have had </p><p>HfijlHBSSfifisfiB worse times. I was a </p><p>little sorry for the baker, </p><p>who was a very decent </p><p>man indeed, but even for </p><p>him I hoped. </p><p> Certainly if any one</p><p>wants solitude, the place </p><p>is Lympne. It is in the </p><p>clay part of Kent, and my </p><p>bungalow stood on the </p><p>edge of an old sea cliff </p><p>and stared across the flats </p><p>of Romney Marsh at the </p><p>sea. In very wet weather </p><p>the place is almost inac- </p><p>cessible, and I have heard </p><p>that at times the postman </p><p>used to traverse the more </p><p>succulent portions of his </p><p>route with boards upon </p><p>his feet. I never saw him </p><p>doing so, but I can quite </p><p>imagine it. Outside the </p><p>doors of the few cottages </p><p>and houses that make up </p><p>the present village big </p><p>birch besoms are stuck, to wipe off the worst of </p><p>the clay, which will give some idea of the texture </p><p>of the district. I doubt if the place would be </p><p>there at all, if it were not a fading memory of </p><p>things gone for ever. It was the big port of Eng- </p><p>land in Roman times, Portus Lemanus, and now the </p><p>sea is four miles away. All down the steep hill are </p><p>boulders and masses of Roman brickwork, and from </p><p>it old Watling Street, still paved in places, starts </p><p>like an arrow to the north. I used to stand on the </p><p>hill and think of it all, the galleys and legions, the</p><p>captives and officials, the women and traders, the </p><p>776 </p><p>AM AZIN OTSTORIES </p><p>speculators like myself, all the swarm and tumult </p><p>that came clanking in and out of the harbour. And </p><p>now just a few lumps of rubble on a grassy slope, </p><p>and a sheep or two—and I! And where the port </p><p>had been were the levels of the marsh, sweeping </p><p>round in a broad curve to distant Dungeness, and </p><p>dotted here and there with tree clumps and the </p><p>church towers of old mediajval towns that are fol- </p><p>lowing Leman us now towards extinction. </p><p> That outlook on the marsh was, indeed, one</p><p>of the finest views I have ever seen. I suppose </p><p>Dungeness was fifteen miles away; it lay like a </p><p>raft on the sea, and farther westward were the </p><p>hills by Hastings under the setting sun. Some- </p><p>times they hung close and clear, sometimes they </p><p>were faded and low, and often the drift of the </p><p>weather took them clean out of sight. And all </p><p>the nearer parts of the marsh were laced and lit </p><p>by ditches and canals. </p><p> The window at which I worked looked over the</p><p>skyline of this crest, and it was from this window </p><p>that I first set eyes on Cavor. It was just as I </p><p>was struggling with my scenario, holding down </p><p>my mind to the sheer hard work of it, and natural- </p><p>ly enough he arrested my attention. </p><p> The sun had set, the sky was a vivid tranquillity</p><p>of green and yellow, and against that he came out </p><p>black—the oddest little figure. </p><p> He was a short, round-bodied, thin-legged little</p><p>man, with a jerky quality in his motions; he had </p><p>seen fit to clothe his extraordinary mind in a &lt; </p><p>cricket cap, and overcoat, and cycling knickerbock- </p><p>ers and stockings. Why he did so I do not know, for </p><p>he never cycled and he never played cricket. It </p><p>was a fortuitous concurrence of garments, aris- </p><p>ing I know not how. He gesticulated with his </p><p>hands and arms, and jerked his head about and </p><p>buzzed. He buzzed like something electric. You </p><p>never heard such buzzing. And ever and again he </p><p>cleared his throat with a most extraordinary noise. </p><p> There had been rain, and that spasmodic walk of</p><p>his was enhanced by the extreme slipperiness </p><p>of the footpath. Exactly as he came against the </p><p>sun he stopped, pulled out a watch, hesitated. Then </p><p>with a sort of convulsive gesture he turned and </p><p>retreated with every manifestation of haste, no </p><p>longer gesticulating, but going with ample strides </p><p>that showed the relatively large size of his feet— </p><p>they were, I remember, grotesquely exaggerated in </p><p>size by adhesive clay—to the best possible advan-</p><p>tage. </p><p> This occurred on the first day of my sojourn,</p><p>when my play-writing energy was at its height </p><p>and I regarded the incident simply as an annoying </p><p>distraction—the waste of five minutes. I return- </p><p>ed to my scenario. But when next evening the </p><p>apparition was repeated with remarkable preci- </p><p>sion, and again the next evening, and indeed every </p><p>evening when rain was not falling, concentration </p><p>upon the scenario became a considerable effort. </p><p>"Confound the man,” said I, “one would think he </p><p>was learning to be a marionette!” and for several </p><p>evenings I cursed him pretty heartily. </p><p> Then my annoyance gave way to amazement</p><p>and curiosity. Why on earth should a man do </p><p>this thing? On the fourteenth evening I could </p><p> stand it no longer, and so soon as he appeared I</p><p> opened the French window, crossed the verandah,</p><p> and directed myself to the point where he invari-</p><p> ably stopped.</p><p> He had his watch out as I came up to him. He</p><p> had a chubby, rubicund face with reddish brown</p><p> eyes—previously I had seen him only against the</p><p> light. "One moment, sir,” said I as he turned.</p><p> He stared. "One moment,” he said, "certainly.</p><p> Or if you wish to speak to me for longer, and it</p><p> is not asking too much—your moment is up—would</p><p> it trouble you to accompany me?”</p><p> "Not in the least,” said I, placing myself beside</p><p> him.</p><p> “My habits are regular. My time for intercourse</p><p> —limited.”</p><p> "This, I presume, is your time for exercise?”</p><p> "It is. I come here to enjoy the sunset.”</p><p> ‘You don’t. You never have been. It’s all</p><p> "Sir?”</p><p> "You never look at it.”</p><p> "Never look at it?”</p><p> “No. I’ve watched you thirteen nights, and</p><p> ! not once have you looked at the sunset—not once.”</p><p> ' He knitted his brows like one who encounters a</p><p> problem.</p><p> c “Well, I enjoy the sunlight—the amtosphere—</p><p> I go along this path, through that gate”—he jerk-</p><p> ed his head over his shoulder—“and round-”</p><p> “You donft. You never have been- It’s all</p><p> nonsense. There isn’t a way. To-night for in-</p><p> stance-”</p><p> "Oh! to-night! Let me see. Ah! 1 just glanced</p><p> at my watch, saw that I had already been out just</p><p> three minutes over the precise half-hour, decided</p><p> there was not time to go round, turned-”</p><p> 'You always do.”</p><p> He looked at me—reflected. “Perhaps I do, now</p><p> I come to think of it. But what was it you wanted</p><p> to speak to me about?”</p><p> “Why, this!”</p><p> “This?”</p><p> “Yes. Why do you do it? Every night you</p><p> come making a noise-”</p><p> “Making a noise?”</p><p> “Like this”—I imitated his buzzing noise.</p><p> He looked at me, and it was evident the buzzing</p><p> awakened distaste. “Do I do that?” he asked.</p><p> “Every blessed evening.”</p><p> “I had no idea.”</p><p> He stopped dead. He regarded me gravely. “Can</p><p> it be,” he said, “that I have formed a Habit?”</p><p> “Well, it looks like it. Doesn’t it?”</p><p> He pulled down his lower lip between finger and</p><p> thumb. He regarded a puddle at his feet.</p><p> "My mind is much occupied,” he said, "And</p><p> you want to know why! Well, sir, I can assure</p><p> you that not only do I not know why I do these</p><p> things, but I did not even know I did them. Come</p><p> to think, it is just as you say; I never have been</p><p> beyond that field . . . And these things annoy</p><p> you ?”</p><p> For some reason I was beginning to relent to-</p><p> wards him. "Not annoy” I said. “But—imagine</p><p> yourself writing a play!”</p><p> “I couldn’t.”</p><p>THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON </p><p>111 </p><p> “Well, anything that needs concentration.”</p><p> 41 Ah!" he said, “of course,” and meditated. His</p><p>expression became so eloquent of distress, that I </p><p>relented still more. After all, there is a touch of </p><p>aggression in demanding of a man you don’t know </p><p>why he hums on a public footpath. </p><p> “You see,” he said weakly, “it’s a habit.”</p><p> “Oh, I recognise that.”</p><p> “I must stop it.”</p><p> “But not if it puts you out. After all, I had</p><p>no business—it’s something of a liberty.” </p><p>“Not at all, sir,” he said, “not at all. I am </p><p>greatly indebted to you. I should guard myself </p><p>against these things. In future I will. Could I </p><p>trouble you—once again? That noise?” </p><p>“Something like this,” I said. “Zuzzoo, zuzzoo. </p><p>But really, you know-” </p><p> “I am greatly obliged to you. In fact, I know</p><p>I am getting absurdly absent-minded. You are </p><p>quite justified, sir—perfectly justified. Indeed, I </p><p>am indebted to you. The thing shall end. And </p><p>now, sir, I have already brought you farther than </p><p>I should have done.” </p><p> “I do hope my impertinence-”</p><p> “Not at all, sir, not at all.”</p><p> We regarded each other for a moment. I raised</p><p>my hat and wished him a good evening. He </p><p>responded convulsively, and so we went our ways. </p><p> At the stile I looked back at his receding figure.</p><p>His bearing had changed remarkably, he seemed </p><p>limp, shrunken. The contrast with his former </p><p>gesticulating, zuzzooing self took me in some ab- </p><p>surd way as pathetic. I watched him out of sight. </p><p>Then wishing very heartily I had kept to my own </p><p>business, I returned to my bungalow and my play. </p><p> The next evening I saw nothing of him, nor</p><p>the next. But he was very much in my mind, and </p><p>it had occurred to me that as a sentimental comic </p><p>character he might serve a useful purpose in the </p><p>development of my plot. The third day he called </p><p>upon me. </p><p> For a time I was puzzled to think what had</p><p>brought him. He made indifferent conversation </p><p>in the most formal way, then abruptly he came to </p><p>business. He wanted to buy me out of my bunga- </p><p>low. </p><p> “You see,” he said, “I don’t blame you in the</p><p>least, but you’ve destroyed a habit, and it dis- </p><p>organises my day. I’ve walked past here for years </p><p>—years. No doubt I’ve hummed. . . . You’ve </p><p>made all that impossible!” </p><p> I suggested he might try some other direction.</p><p>“No. There is no other direction. This is the </p><p>only one. I’ve inquired. And now—every after- </p><p>noon at four—I come to a dead wall.” </p><p> “But, my dear sir, if the thing is so important</p><p>to you-” </p><p> “It’s vital. You see, I’m—I’m an investigator</p><p>—I am engaged in a scientific research. I live—” </p><p>he paused and seemed to think. “Just over there,” </p><p>he said, and pointed suddenly dangerously near </p><p>my eye. “The house with white chimneys you see </p><p>just over the trees. And my circumstances are ab- </p><p>normal—abnormal. I am on the point of complet- </p><p>ing one of the most important demonstrations— </p><p>I can assure you one of the most important demon- </p><p>strations that have ever been made. It requires </p><p>constant thought, constant mental ease and activ- </p><p>ity. And the afternoon was my brightest time!— </p><p>effervescing with new ideas—new points of view.” </p><p> “But why not come by still?"</p><p> “It would be all different I should be self-</p><p>conscious. I should think of you at your play— </p><p>watching me irritated—instead of thinking of my </p><p>work. No! I must have the bungalow.” </p><p> I meditated. Naturally, I wanted to think the</p><p>matter over thoroughly before anything decisive </p><p>was said. I was generally ready enough for busi- </p><p>ness in those days, and selling always attracted </p><p>me; but in the first place it was not my bungalow, </p><p>and even if I sold it to him at a good price I </p><p>might get inconvenienced in the delivery of goods </p><p>if the current owner got wind of the transaction, </p><p>and in the second I was, well—undischarged. It </p><p>was clearly a business that required delicate hand- </p><p>ling. Moreover, the possibility of his being in </p><p>pursuit of some valuable invention also interested </p><p>me. It occurred to me that I would like to know </p><p>more of this research, not with any dishonest in- </p><p>tention, but simply with an idea that to know what</p><p>it was would be a relief from play-writing. I </p><p>threw out feelers. </p><p> He was quite willing to supply information.</p><p>Indeed, once he was fairly under way the conver- </p><p>sation became a monologue. He talked like a man </p><p>long pent up, who has had it over with himself </p><p>again and again. He talked for nearly an hour, </p><p>and I must confess I found it a pretty stiff bit of </p><p>listening. But through it all there was the under- </p><p>tone of satisfaction one feels when one is neglect- </p><p>ing work one has set oneself. During that first </p><p>interview I gathered very little of the drift of his </p><p>talk. Half his words were technicalities entirely </p><p>strange to me, and he illustrated one or two points </p><p>with what he was pleased to call elementary mathe- </p><p>matics, computing on an envelope with a copying- </p><p>ink pencil, in a manner that made it hard even to </p><p>seem to understand. “Yes,” I said, “yea. Go on!” </p><p>Nevertheless I made out enough to convince me </p><p>that he was no mere crank playing at discoveries. </p><p>In spite of his crank-like appearance there was a </p><p>force about him that made that impossible. Wfcat- </p><p>ever it was, it was a thing with mechanical possi- </p><p>bilities. He told me of a work-shed he had, and </p><p>of three assistants—originally jobbing carpenters </p><p>—whom he had trained. Now, from the work-shed </p><p>to the patent office is clearly only one step. He </p><p>invited me to see those things. I accepted readily, </p><p>and took care, by a remark or so, to underline that. </p><p>The proposed transfer of the bungalow remained </p><p>very conveniently in suspense. </p><p> At last he rose to depart, with an apology for</p><p>the length of his call. Talking over his work was, </p><p>he said, a pleasure enjoyed only too rarely. It </p><p>was not often he found such an intelligent listener </p><p>as myself, he mingled very little with professional </p><p>scientific men. </p><p> “So much pettiness,” he explained; "so much</p><p>intrigue! And really, when one has an idea—a </p><p>novel, fertilising idea— I don’t want to be un- </p><p>charitable, but-” </p><p> I am a man who believes in impulses. I made</p><p>778 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>what was perhaps a rash proposition. But you </p><p>must remember, that I had been alone, play-writing </p><p>in Lympne, for fourteen days, and my compunction </p><p>for his ruined walk still hung about me. “Why </p><p>not,” said I, “make this your new habit? In the </p><p>place of the one I spoilt? At least, until we can </p><p>settle about the bungalow. What you want is to </p><p>turn over your work in your mind. That you have </p><p>always done during your afternoon walk. Un- </p><p>fortunately that’s over—you can’t get things back </p><p>as they were. But why not come and talk about </p><p>your work to me; use me as a sort of wall against </p><p>which you may throw your thoughts and catch them </p><p>again? It’s certain I don’t know enough to steal </p><p>your ideas myself—and I know no scientific </p><p>men-” </p><p> I stopped. He was considering. Evidently the</p><p>thing attracted him. “But I’m afraid I should </p><p>bore you,” he said. </p><p> “You think I’m too dull?”</p><p> “Oh, no; but technicalities-”</p><p> “Anyhow, you’ve interested me immensely this</p><p>afternoon.” </p><p> "Of course it would be a great help to me. Noth-</p><p>ing clears up one’s ideas so much as explaining them. </p><p>Hitherto—&gt;—” </p><p> “My dear sir, say no more.”</p><p> “But really can you spare the time?”</p><p> “There is no rest like change of occupation,” I</p><p>said, with profound conviction. </p><p> The affair was over. On my verandah steps he</p><p>turned. “I am already greatly indebted to you,” </p><p>he said. </p><p> I made an interrogative noise.</p><p> “You have completely cured me of that ridicu-</p><p>lous habit of humming,” he explained. </p><p> I think I said I was glad to be of any service to</p><p>him, and he turned away. </p><p> Immediately the train of thought that our con-</p><p>versation had suggested must have resumed its </p><p>sway. His arms began to wave in their former </p><p>fashion. The faint echo of “zuzzoo” came back to</p><p>me on the breeze. . . . </p><p> Well, after all, that was not my affair. . . .</p><p> He came the next day, and again the next</p><p>day after that, and delivered two lectures on physics </p><p>to our mutual satisfaction. He talked with an air </p><p>of being extremely lucid about the “ether,” and </p><p>“tubes of force,” and “gravitational potential,” </p><p>and things like that, and I sat in my other folding- </p><p>chair and said, “Yes,” “Go on,” “I follow you,” to </p><p>keep him going. It was tremendously difficult stuff, </p><p>but I do not think he ever suspected how much I </p><p>did not understand him. There were moments </p><p>when I doubted whether I was well employed, but </p><p>at any rate I was resting from that confounded </p><p>play. Now and then things gleamed on me clearly </p><p>for a space, only to vanish just when I thought </p><p>I had hold of them. Sometimes my attention failed </p><p>altogether, and I would give it up and sit and </p><p>stare at him, wondering whether, after all, it would </p><p>not be better to use him as a central figure in a </p><p>good farce and let all this other stuff slide. And </p><p>then, perhaps, I would catch on again for a bit. </p><p> At the earliest opportunity I went to see his</p><p>house. It was large and carelessly furnished; there </p><p>were no servants other than his three assistants, </p><p>and his dietary and private life were characterised </p><p>by a philosophical simplicity. He was a water- </p><p>drinker, a vegetarian, and all those logical dis- </p><p>ciplinary things. But the sight of his equipment </p><p>settled many doubts. It looked like business from </p><p>cellar to attic—an amazing little place to find in an </p><p>out-of-the-way village. The ground-floor rooms </p><p>contained benches and apparatus, the bakehouse </p><p>and scullery boiler had developed into respectable </p><p>furnaces, dynamos occupied the cellar, and there </p><p>was a gasometer in the garden. He showed it to </p><p>me with all the confiding zest of a man who has </p><p>been living too much alone. His seclusion was over- </p><p>flowing now in an excess of confidence, and I had </p><p>the good luck to be the recipient. </p><p> The three assistants were creditable specimens</p><p>of the class of “handy-men” from which they came. </p><p>Conscientious, if unintelligent, strong, civil, and </p><p>willing. One, Spargus, who did the cooking and </p><p>all the metal work, had been a sailor; a second, </p><p>Gibbs, was a joiner; and the third was an ex-job- </p><p>bing gardener, and now general assistant. They </p><p>were the merest labourers. All the intelligent work </p><p>was done by Cavor. Theirs was the darkest ignor- </p><p>ance compared even with my muddled impression. </p><p> And now, as to the nature of these inquiries.</p><p>Here, unhappily, comes a grave difficulty. I am</p><p>no scientific expert, and if I were to attempt to set </p><p>forth in the highly scientific language of Mr. </p><p>Cavor the aim to which his experiments tended, I </p><p>am afraid I should confuse not only the reader but </p><p>myself, and almost certainly I should make some </p><p>blunder that would bring upon me the mockery of </p><p>every up-to-date student of mathematical physics </p><p>in the country. The best thing I can do therefore </p><p>is, I think, to give my impressions in my own inex- </p><p>act language, without any attempt to wear a gar- </p><p>ment of knowledge to which I have no claim. </p><p> The object of Mr. Cavor’s search was a substance</p><p>that should be “opaque”—he used some other word </p><p>I have forgotten, but “opaque” conveys the idea— </p><p>to “all forms of radiant energy.” “Radiant </p><p>energy,” he made me understand, was anything like </p><p>light or heat, or those Rontgen Rays there was so </p><p>much talk about a year or so ago, or the electric </p><p>waves of Marconi, or gravitation. All these things, </p><p>he said, radiate out from centres, and act on bodies </p><p>at a distance, whence comes the term “radiant </p><p>energy.” Now almost all substances are opaque </p><p>to some form or other of radiant energy. Glass, </p><p>for example, is transparent to light, but much less </p><p>so to heat, so that it is useful as a fire-screen; and </p><p>alum is transparent to light, but blocks heat almost </p><p>completely. A solution of iodine in carbon bisul- </p><p>phide, on the other hand, completely blocks light, </p><p>but is quite transparent to heat. It will hide a fire </p><p>from you, but permit all its warmth to reach you. </p><p>Metals are not only opaque to light and heat, but </p><p>also to radiant electrical energy, which passes </p><p>through both iodine solution and glass almost as </p><p>though they were not interposed. And so on. </p><p> Now all known substances are “transparent” to</p><p>gravitation. You can use screens of various sorts </p><p>to cut off the light or heat, or electrical influence </p><p>of the sun, or the warmth of the earth from any- </p><p>THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON </p><p>77 9 </p><p>thing; you can screen things by sheets of metal </p><p>from Marconi's rays, but nothing will cut off the </p><p>gravitational attraction of the sun or the gravita- </p><p>tional attraction of the earth. Yet why there </p><p>should be nothing it is hard to say. Cavor did not </p><p>see why such a substance should not exist, and </p><p>certainly I could not tell him. I had never thought </p><p>of such a possibility before. He showed me by </p><p>calculations on paper, which Lord Kelvin, no doubt, </p><p>or Professor Lodge, or Professor Karl Pearson, or </p><p>any of those great scientific people might have </p><p>understood, but which simply reduced me to a </p><p>hopeless muddle, that not only was such a sub- </p><p>stance possible, but that it must satisfy certain </p><p>conditions. It was an amazing piece of reasoning. </p><p>Much as it amazed and exercised me at the time, </p><p>it would be impossible to reproduce it here. “Yes,” </p><p>I said to it all, “yes; go on!” Suffice it for this </p><p>story that he believed he might be able to manu- </p><p>facture this possible substance opaque to gravita- </p><p>tion out of a complicated alloy of metals and some- </p><p>thing new—a new element, I fancy—called, I be- </p><p>lieve, helium, which was sent to him from London </p><p>in sealed stone jars. Doubt has been thrown upon </p><p>this detail, but I am almost certain it was helium </p><p>he had sent him in sealed stone jars. It was cer- </p><p>tainly something very gaseous and thin. If only </p><p>I had taken notes. » . , </p><p> But then, how was I to foresee the necessity of</p><p>taking notes? </p><p> Any one with the merest germ of an imagination</p><p>will understand the extraordinary possibilities of </p><p>such a substance, and will sympathise a little with </p><p>the emotion I felt as this understanding emerged </p><p>from the haze of abstruse phrases in which Cavor </p><p>expressed himself. Comic relief in a play indeed! </p><p>It was some time before I would believe that I </p><p>had interpreted him aright, and I was very careful </p><p>not to ask questions that would have enabled him </p><p>to gauge the profundity of misunderstanding into </p><p>which he dropped his daily exposition. But no one </p><p>reading the story of it here will sympathise fully, </p><p>because from my barren narrative it will be im- </p><p>possible to gather the strength of my conviction </p><p>that this astonishing substance was positively going </p><p>to be made.	/■</p><p> I do not recall that I gave my play an hour’s</p><p>consecutive work at any time after my visit to his </p><p>house. My imagination had other things to do. </p><p>There seemed no limit to the possibilities of the </p><p>stuff; whichever way I tried I came on miracles </p><p>and revolutions. For example, if one wanted to</p><p>lift a weight, however enormous, one had only to </p><p>get a sheet of this substance beneath it, and one </p><p>might lift it with a straw. My first natural impulse </p><p>was to apply this principle to guns and ironclads, </p><p>and all the material and methods of war, and from </p><p>that to shipping, locomotion, building, every con- </p><p>ceivable form of human industry. The chance that </p><p>had brought me into the very birth-chamber of </p><p>this new time—it was an epoch, no less—was one </p><p>of those chances that come once in a thousand years. </p><p>The thing unrolled, it expanded and expanded. </p><p>Among other things I saw in it my redemption as a </p><p>business man. I saw a parent company, and daugh- </p><p>ter companies, applications to right of us, applica- </p><p>tions to left, rings and trusts, privileges, and con- </p><p>cessions spreading and spreading, until one vast, </p><p>stupendous Cavorite company ran and ruled the </p><p>world. </p><p> And I was in it!</p><p> I took my line straight away. I knew I was</p><p>staking everything, but I jumped there and then. </p><p> “We’re on absolutely the biggest thing that has</p><p>ever been invented,” I said, and put the accent </p><p>on “we.” “If you want to keep me out of this, </p><p>you’ll have to do it with a gun. I’m coming down </p><p>to be your fourth labourer to-morrow.” </p><p> He seemed surprised at my enthusiasm, but not</p><p>a bit suspicious or hostile. Bather, he was self- </p><p>depreciatory. </p><p> He looked at me doubtfully. “But do you really</p><p>think—?” he said. “And your play I How about </p><p>that play?” </p><p> “It’s vanished!” I cried. “My dear sir, don’t</p><p>you see what you’ve got? Don’t you see what </p><p>you’re going to do?” </p><p> That was merely a rhetorical turn, but positively,</p><p>he didn’t. At first I could not believe it. He had </p><p>not had the beginning of the inkling of an idea. </p><p>This astonishing little man had been working on </p><p>purely theoretical grounds the whole time! When </p><p>he said it was “the most important” research the </p><p>world had ever seen, he simply meant it squared </p><p>up so many theories, settled so much that was in </p><p>doubt; he had troubled no more about the appli- </p><p>cation of the stuff he was going to turn out than if </p><p>he had been a machine that makes guns. This was </p><p>a possible substance, and he was going to make it! </p><p>V’la tout, as the Frenchman says. </p><p> Beyond that, he was childish! If he made it,</p><p>it would go down to posterity as -Cavorite or Cavor- </p><p>ine, and he would be made an F.R.S., and his por- </p><p>trait given away as a scientific worthy with Nature, </p><p>and things like that. And that was all he saw! </p><p>He would have dropped this -bombshell into the </p><p>world as though he had discovered a new species of </p><p>gnat, if it had not happened that I had come along. </p><p>And there it would have lain and fizzled, like </p><p>one or two other little things these scientific people </p><p>have lit and dropped about us. </p><p> When I realised this, it was I did the talking,</p><p>and Cavor who said, “Go on!” I jumped up. I </p><p>paced the room, gesticulating like a boy of twenty. </p><p>I tried to make him understand his duties and </p><p>responsibilities in the matter—our duties and re- </p><p>sponsibilities in the matter. I assured him we </p><p>might make wealth enough to work any sort of </p><p>social revolution we fancied, we might own and </p><p>order the whole world. I told him of companies and </p><p>patents, and the case for secret processes. All </p><p>these things seemed to take him much as his mathe- </p><p>matics had taken me. A look of perplexity came </p><p>into his ruddy little face. He stammered something </p><p>about indifference to wealth, but I brushed all </p><p>that aside. He had got to be rich, and it was no </p><p>good his stammering. I gave him to understand </p><p>the sort of man I was, and that I had had very </p><p>considerable business experience. I did not tell </p><p>him I was an undischarged bankrupt at the time, </p><p>because that was temporary, but I think I reconciled </p><p>my evident poverty with my financial claims. And </p><p>780 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> quite insensibly, in the way such projects grow,</p><p> the understanding of a Cavorite monopoly grew</p><p> up between us. He was to make the stuff, and I</p><p> was to make the boom.</p><p> I stuck like a leech to the "we"—"you” and "I”,</p><p> didn’t exist for me.</p><p> His idea was that the profits I spoke of might</p><p> go to endow research, but that, of course, was a</p><p> matter we had to settle later. "That’s all right,”</p><p> I shouted, “that’s all right.” The great point,</p><p> as I insisted, was to get the thing done.</p><p> “Here is a substance,” I cried, “no home, no</p><p> factory, no fortress, no ship can dare to be without</p><p> —more universally applicable even than a patent</p><p> medicine. There isn’t a solitary aspect of it, not</p><p> one of its ten thousand possible uses that will not</p><p> make us rich, Cavor, beyond the dreams of avarice!”</p><p> “No I” he said. "I begin to see. It's extraordi-</p><p> nary how one gets new points of view by talking</p><p> over things!”</p><p> "And as it happens you have just talked to the</p><p> right man!”</p><p> "I suppose no one,” he said, “is absolutely</p><p> averse to enormous wealth. Of course there is one</p><p> thing-”</p><p> He paused. I stood still.</p><p> "It is just possible, you know, that we may not</p><p> be able to make it after all! It may be one of</p><p> those things that are a theoretical possibility, but</p><p> a practical absurdity. Or when we make it, there</p><p> may be some little hitch-!”</p><p> “We’ll tackle the hitch when it comes,” said I.</p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>The First Making of Cavorite </p><p> BUT Cavor’s fears were groundless, so far as</p><p> the actual making was concerned. On the</p><p> 14th of October, 1899, this incredible sub-</p><p> stance was made!</p><p> Oddly enough, it was made at last by accident,</p><p> when Mr. Cavor least expected it. He had fused</p><p> together a number of metals and certain other</p><p> things—I wish I knew the particulars now!—and</p><p> he intended to leave the mixture a week and then</p><p> allow it to cool slowly. Unless he had miscalculated,</p><p> the last stage in the combination would occur when</p><p> the stuff sank to a temperature of 60° Fahr. But</p><p> it chanced that, unknown to Cavor, dissension had</p><p> arisen about the furnace tending. Gibbs, who had</p><p> previously seen to this, had suddenly attempted</p><p> to shift it to the man who had been a gardener, on</p><p> the score that coal was soil, being dug, and therefore</p><p> v could not possibly fall within the province of a</p><p> joiner; the man who had been a jobbing gardener</p><p> alleged, however, that coal was a metallic or ore-</p><p> like substance, let alone that he was cook. But</p><p> Spargus insisted on Gibbs doing the coaling, seeing</p><p> that he was a joiner and that coal is notoriously</p><p> fossil wood. Consequently Gibbs ceased to replen-</p><p> ish the furnace, and no one else did so, and Cavor</p><p> was too much immersed in certain interesting prob-</p><p> lems concerning a Cavorite flying machine (neglect-</p><p> ing the resistance of the air and one or two other</p><p> points) to perceive that anything was wrong. And</p><p> thp	bfr+h n? his invention took place</p><p>just as he was coming across the field to my </p><p>bungalow for our afternoon talk and tea. </p><p> I remember the occasion with extreme vividness.</p><p>The water was boiling, and everything was pre- </p><p>pared, and the sound of his "zuezoo” had brought </p><p>me out upon the verandah. His active little figure </p><p>was black against the autumnal sunset, and to the </p><p>right the chimneys of his house just rose above </p><p>a gloriously tinted group of trees. Remoter rose the </p><p>Wealden Hills, faint and blue, while to the left </p><p>the hazy marsh spread out spacious and serene. And </p><p>then- </p><p> The chimneys jerked heavenward, smashing into</p><p>a string of bricks as they rose, and the roof and a </p><p>miscellany of furniture followed. Then overtaking </p><p>them came a huge white flame. The trees about the </p><p>building swayed and whirled and tore themselves </p><p>to pieces, that sprang towards the flare. My ears </p><p>were smitten with a clap of thunder that left me </p><p>deaf on one side for life, and all about me win- </p><p>dows smashed, unheeded. </p><p> I took three steps from the verandah towards</p><p>Cavor’s house and even as I did so came the wind. </p><p> Instantly my coat tails were over my head, and</p><p>I was progressing in great leaps and bounds, and </p><p>quite against my will, towards him. In the same </p><p>moment the discoverer was seized, whirled about, </p><p>and flew through the screaming air. I saw one of </p><p>my chimney pots hit the ground within six yards </p><p>of me, leap a score of feet, and so hurry in great,</p><p>strides towards the focus of the disturbance. Cavor, </p><p>kicking and flapping, came down again, rolled over </p><p>and over on the ground for a space, struggled </p><p>up and was lifted and borne forward at an enor- </p><p>mous velocity, vanishing at last among the labour- </p><p>ing, lashing trees that writhed about his house. </p><p> A mass of smoke and ashes, and a square of</p><p>bluish shining substance rushed up towards the </p><p>zenith. A large fragment of fencing came sailing </p><p>past me, dropped edgeways, hit the ground and </p><p>fell flat, and then the worst was over. The aerial </p><p>commotion fell swiftly until it was a mere strong </p><p>gale, and I became once more aware that I had </p><p>breath and feet. By leaning back against the wind </p><p>I managed to stop, and could collect such wits as </p><p>still remained to me. </p><p> In that instant the whole face of the world had</p><p>changed. The tranquil sunset had vanished, the </p><p>sky was dark with scurrying clouds, everything was </p><p>flattened and swaying with the gale. I glanced </p><p>back to see if my bungalow was still in a general </p><p>way standing, then staggered forward towards the </p><p>trees amongst which Cavor had vanished, and </p><p>through whose tall and leaf-denuded branches shone </p><p>the flames of his burning house. </p><p> I entered the copse, dashing from one tree to</p><p>another and clinging to them, and for a space I </p><p>sought him in vain. Then amidst a heap of smashed </p><p>branches and fencing that had banked itself against </p><p>a portion of his garden wall I perceived something </p><p>stir. 1 made a run for this, but before I reached </p><p>it a brown object separated itself, rose on two </p><p>muddy legs, and protruded two drooping, bleeding </p><p>hands. Some tattered ends of garment fluttered </p><p>out from its middle portion and streamed before </p><p>the wind, </p><p>THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON </p><p>781 </p><p> For a moment I did not recognise this earthy</p><p>lump, and then I saw that it was Cavor, caked in </p><p>the mud in whioh he had rolled. He leant forward </p><p>against the wind, rubbing the dirt from his eyes </p><p>and mouth. </p><p> He extended a muddy lump of hand, and staggered</p><p>a pace towards me. His face worked with emotion, </p><p>little lumps of mud kept falling from it. He looked </p><p>as damaged and pitiful as any living creature I </p><p>have ever seen, and his remark therefore amazed </p><p>me exceedingly. “Gratulate me,” he gasped </p><p>“gratulate me!” </p><p> “Congratulate you!” said I. “Good heavens!</p><p>What for?” </p><p> “I’ve done it.”</p><p> “You have. What on earth caused that explo-</p><p>sion?” </p><p> A gust of wind blew his words away. I under-</p><p>stood him to say that it wasn’t an explosion at all. </p><p>The wind hurled me into collision with him, and </p><p>we stood clinging to one another. </p><p> "Try and get back to my bungalow,” I bawled</p><p>in his ear. He did not hear me, and shouted some- </p><p>thing about “three martyrs—science,” and also </p><p>something about “not much good.” At the time </p><p>he laboured under the impression that his three </p><p>attendants had perished in the whirlwind. Happily </p><p>this was incorrect. Directly he had left for my </p><p>bungalow they had gone off to the public-house in </p><p>Lympne to discuss the question of the furnaces </p><p>over some trivial refreshment. </p><p> I repeated my suggestion of getting back to</p><p>my bungalow, and this time he understood. We </p><p>clung arm-in-arm and started, and managed at </p><p>last to reach the shelter of as much roof as was left </p><p>to me. For a space we sat in arm-chairs and panted. </p><p>All the windows were broken, and the lighter </p><p>articles of furniture were in great disorder, but no </p><p>irrevocable damage was done. Happily the kitchen </p><p>door had stood the pressure upon it, so that all my </p><p>crockery and cooking materials had survived. The </p><p>oil stove was still burning, and I put on the water </p><p>to boil again for tea. And that prepared, I could </p><p>turn on Cavor for his explanation. </p><p> “Quite correct,” he insisted; “quite correct. I’ve</p><p>done it, and it's all right.” </p><p> “But,” I protested. “All right! Why, there</p><p>can’t be a rick standing, or a fence or a thatched </p><p>roof undamaged for twenty miles round. . . </p><p> “It’s all right—really. I didn’t, of course, foresee</p><p>this little upset. My mind was preoccupied with </p><p>another problem, and I’m apt to disregard these </p><p>practical side issues. But it’s all right-” </p><p> “My dear sir,” I cried, “don’t you see you’ve</p><p>done thousands of pounds’ worth of damage?” </p><p>“There, I throw myself on your discretion. I’m </p><p>not a practical man, of course, but don't you think </p><p>they will regard it as a cyclone?” </p><p> "But the explosion-”</p><p> "It was not an explosion. It’s perfectly simple.</p><p>Only, as I say, I’m apt to overlook these little things. </p><p>It's that zuzzoo business on a larger scale. Inad- </p><p>vertently I made this substance of mine, this </p><p>Cavo'fite, in a thin, wide sheet. . . .” </p><p> IT? rr3.’’0?^ "Y"ii j»r? onit? pVf'r fVi?.* fhr»</p><p>is opaque to gravitation, that it cuts off things from </p><p>gravitating towards each other?” </p><p> “Yes,” said I. “Yes.”</p><p> “Well, so soon as it reached a temperature of</p><p>60° Fahr. and the process of its manufacture was </p><p>complete, the air above it, the portions of roof and </p><p>ceiling and floor above it ceased to have weight. I </p><p>suppose you know—everybody knows nowadays— </p><p>that, as a usual thing, the air has weight, that it </p><p>presses on everything at the surface of the earth, </p><p>presses in all directions, with a pressure of fourteen </p><p>and a half pounds to the square inch?” </p><p> “I know that,” said L “Go on.”</p><p> “I know that too,” he remarked. “Only this</p><p>shows you how useless knowledge is unless you ap- </p><p>ply it. You see, over our Cavorite this ceased to be </p><p>the case, the air there ceased to exert any pressure, </p><p>and the air around it and not over the Cavorite, was </p><p>exerting a pressure of fourteen pounds and a half </p><p>to the square inch upon this suddenly weightless </p><p>air. Ah! you begin to see! The air all about the </p><p>Cavorite crushed in upon the air above it with ir- </p><p>resistible force. The air above the Cavorite was </p><p>forced upward violently, the air that rushed in to re- </p><p>place it immediately lost weight, ceased to exert any </p><p>pressure, followed suit, blew the ceiling through </p><p>and the roof off. . . . </p><p> ‘Tou perceive,” he said, “it formed a sort ©f</p><p>atmospheric fountain, a kind of chimney in the at- </p><p>mosphere. And if the Cavorite itself hadn’t been </p><p>loose and so got sucked up the chimney, does it </p><p>occur to you what would have happened?” </p><p> I thought. “I suppose,” I said, “the air would</p><p>be rushing up and up over that infernal piece of </p><p>stuff now.” </p><p> “Precisely,” he said. “A huge fountain-”</p><p> “Spouting into space! Good heavens! Why, it</p><p>would have squirted all the atmosphere of the earth </p><p>away! It would have robbed the world of air! </p><p>It would have been the death of all mankind! That </p><p>little lump of stuff!” </p><p> “Not exactly into space,” said Cavor, “but as</p><p>bad—practically. It would have whipped the air </p><p>off the world as one peels a banana, and flung it </p><p>thousands of miles. It would have dropped back </p><p>again, of course—but on an asphyxiated world! </p><p>From our point of view very little better than if It </p><p>never came back!” </p><p> I stared. As yet I was too amazed to realize</p><p>how all my expectations had been upset “What </p><p>do you mean to do now?” I asked. </p><p> “In the first place, if I may borrow a garden</p><p>trowel I will remove some of this earth with which </p><p>I am encased, and then if I may avail myself of </p><p>your domestic conveniences I will have a bath. </p><p>This done, we will converse more at leisure. It </p><p>will be wise, I think”—he laid a muddy hand on </p><p>my arm—“if nothing were said of this affair be- </p><p>yond ourselves. I know I have caused great damage </p><p>—probably even dwelling-houses may be ruined </p><p>here and there upon the country-side. But on the </p><p>other hand, I cannot possibly pay for the damage </p><p>I have done, and if the real cause of this is pub- </p><p>lished, it will lead only to heartburning and the ob- </p><p>struction of my work. One cannot foresee every- </p><p>thing, you know, and I cannot consent for one </p><p>noT”Pr*t fi !?l fV,p h:!r*-Vn of </p><p>782 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>tiotis to my theorising. Later on, when you have </p><p>come in with your practical mind, and Cavorite is </p><p>floated—floated is the word, isn’t it?—and it has </p><p>realised all you anticipate for it, we may set matters </p><p>right with these persons. But not now—not now. </p><p>If no other explanation is offered, people, in the </p><p>present unsatisfactory state of meteorological </p><p>science, will ascribe all this to a cyclone; there might </p><p>be a public subscription, and as my house has col- </p><p>lapsed and been burnt, I should in that case receive </p><p>a considerable share in the compensation, which </p><p>would be extremely helpful to the prosecution of </p><p>our researches. But if it is known that I caused </p><p>this, there will be no public subscription, and </p><p>everybody will be put out. Practically I should </p><p>never get a chance of working in peace again. My </p><p>three assistants may or may not have perished. </p><p>That is a detail. If they have, it is no great loss; </p><p>they were more zealous than able, and this pre- </p><p>mature event must be largely due to their joint </p><p>neglect of the furnace. If they have not perished, </p><p>I doubt if they have the intelligence to explain the </p><p>affair. They will accept the cyclone story. And if, </p><p>during the temporary unfitness of my house for oc- </p><p>cupation, I may lodge in one of the untenanted </p><p>rooms of this bungalow of yours-” </p><p> He paused and regarded me.</p><p> A man of such possibilities, I reflected, is no</p><p>ordinary guest to entertain. </p><p> “Perhaps," said I, rising to my feet, “we had</p><p>better begin by looking for a trowel,” and I led </p><p>the way to the scattered vestiges of the greenhouse. </p><p> And while he was having his bath I considered</p><p>the entire question alone. It was clear there were </p><p>drawbacks to Mr. Cavor’s society I had not fore- </p><p>seen. The absent-mindedness that had just escaped </p><p>depopulating the terrestrial globe, might at any </p><p>moment result in some other grave inconvenience. </p><p>On the other hand I was young, my affairs were in </p><p>a mess, and I was in just the mood for reckless </p><p>adventure—with a chance of something good at the </p><p>end of it. I had quite settled in my mind that I </p><p>was to have half at least in that aspect of the affair. </p><p>Fortunately I held my bungalow, as I have already </p><p>explained, on a three-year agreement, without being </p><p>responsible for repairs; and my furniture, such as </p><p>there was of it, had been hastily purchased, was </p><p>unpaid for, insured, and altogether devoid of as- </p><p>sociations. In the end I decided to keep on with </p><p>him, and see the business through. ^ </p><p> Certainly the aspect of things had changed very</p><p>greatly. I no longer doubted at all the enormous </p><p>possibilities of the substance, but I began to have </p><p>doubts about the gun-carriage and the patent boots. </p><p> We set to work at once to reconstruct his labora-</p><p>tory and proceed with our experiments. Cavor </p><p>talked more on my level than he had ever done </p><p>before, when it came to the question of how we </p><p>should make the stuff next. </p><p> “Of course we must make it again,” he said,</p><p>with a sort of glee I had not expected in him, “of </p><p>course we must make it again. We have caught </p><p>a Tartar, perhaps, but we have left the theoretical </p><p>behind us for good and all. If we can possibly </p><p>avoid wrecking this little planet of ours, we will. </p><p>But—there must be risks! There must be. In ex- </p><p>perimental work there always are. And here, as a </p><p>practical man, you must come in. For my own </p><p>part it seems to me we might make it edgeways, </p><p>perhaps, and very thin. Yet I don’t know. I have </p><p>a certain dim perception of another method. I can </p><p>hardly explain it yet. But curiously enough it </p><p>came into my mind, while I was rolling over and </p><p>over in the mud before the wind, and very doubtful </p><p>how the whole adventure was to end, as being </p><p>absolutely the thing I ought to have done.” </p><p> Even with my aid we found some little difficulty,</p><p>and meanwhile we kept at work restoring the </p><p>laboratory. There was plenty to do before it was </p><p>absolutely necessary to decide upon the precise form </p><p>and method of our second attempt. Our only hitch </p><p>was the strike of the three labourers, who objected </p><p>to my activity as a foreman. But that matter we </p><p>compromised after two days’ delay. </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>The Building of the Sphere </p><p>I REMEMBER the occasion very distinctly when </p><p>Cavor told me of his idea of the sphere. He </p><p>had had intimations of it before, but at the </p><p>time it seemed to come to him in a rush. We </p><p>were returning to the bungalow for tea, and on </p><p>the way he fell humming. Suddenly he shouted, </p><p>“That’s it! That finishes it! A sort of roller </p><p>blind!” </p><p> “Finishes what?” I asked.</p><p> “Space—anywhere! The moon!”</p><p> “What do you mean?”</p><p> “Mean? Why—it must be a sphere! That’s</p><p>what I mean!” </p><p> I saw I was out of it, and for a time I let him</p><p>talk in his own fashion. I hadn’t the ghost of an </p><p>idea then of his drift. But after he had taken tea </p><p>he made it clear to me. </p><p> “It’s like this,” he said. “Last time I ran this</p><p>stuff that cuts things off from gravitation into a </p><p>flat tank with an overlap that held it down. And </p><p>directly it had cooled and the manufacture was </p><p>completed all that uproar happened, nothing above </p><p>it weighed anything, the air went squirting up, the </p><p>house squirted up, and if the stuff itself hadn’t </p><p>squirted up too, I don’t know what would have </p><p>happened! But suppose the substance is loose, </p><p>and quite free to go up?” </p><p> “It will go up at once!”</p><p> “Exactly. With no more disturbance than firing</p><p>a big gun.” </p><p> “But what good will that do?”</p><p> “I’m going up with it!”</p><p> I put down my teacup and stared at him.</p><p>“Imagine a sphere,” he explained, “large enough </p><p>to hold two people and their luggage. It will be </p><p>made of steel lined with thick glass; it will contain </p><p>a proper store of solidified air, concentrated food, </p><p>water-distilling apparatus, and so forth. And </p><p>enamelled, as it were, on the outer steels—-?” </p><p>“Cavorite?” </p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “But how will you get inside?”</p><p> “There was a similar problem about a dumpling.”</p><p> “Yes, I know. But how?”</p><p>THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON </p><p>783 </p><p> “That’s perfectly easy. An air-tight manhole</p><p>is all that is needed. That, of course, will have </p><p>to be a little complicated; there will have to be a </p><p>valve, so that things may be thrown out, if neces- </p><p>sary, without much loss of air.” </p><p> “Like Jules Verne’s thing in A Trip to the Moon?”</p><p> But Cavor was not a reader of fiction.</p><p> “I begin to see,” I said slowly. “And you could</p><p>get in and screw yourself up while the Cavorite was </p><p>warm, and as soon as it cooled it would become </p><p>impervious to gravitation, and off you would </p><p>fly-” </p><p> “At a tangent.”</p><p> “You would go off in a straight line-” I</p><p>stopped abruptly. “What is to prevent the thing </p><p>travelling in a straight line into space for ever?” </p><p>I asked. “You’re not safe to get anywhere, and </p><p>if you do—how will you get back?” </p><p> “I’ve just thought of that,” said Cavor. “That’s</p><p>what I meant when I said the thing is finished. The </p><p>inner glass sphere can be air-tight, and, except for </p><p>the manhole, continuous, and the steel sphere can </p><p>be made in sections, each section capable of rolling </p><p>up after the fashion of a roller blind. These can </p><p>easily be worked by springs, and released and check- </p><p>ed by electricity conveyed by platinum wires fused </p><p>through the glass. All that is merely a question' </p><p>of detail. So you see, that except for the thickness </p><p>of the blind rollers, the Cavorite exterior of the </p><p>sphere will consist of windows or blinds, whichever </p><p>you like to call them. Well, when all these windows </p><p>or blinds are shut, no light, no heat, no gravitation, </p><p>no radiant energy of any sort will get at the inside </p><p>of the sphere, it will fly on through space in a </p><p>straight line, as you say. But open a window, </p><p>imagine one of the windows open. Then at once </p><p>any heavy body that chances to be in that direction </p><p>will attract us-” </p><p> I sat taking it in.</p><p> “You see?” he said.</p><p> "Oh, I see.”</p><p> “Practically we shall be able to tack about in</p><p>space just as we wish. Get attracted by this and </p><p>that.” </p><p> “Oh, yes. That’s clear enough. Only-”</p><p> “Well?”</p><p> “I don’t quite see what we shall do it for! It’s</p><p>reafly only jumping off the world and back again.” </p><p>“Surely! For example, one might go to the </p><p>moon.” </p><p> “And when one got there? What would you</p><p>find?” </p><p> “We should see- Oh! consider the new</p><p>knowledge.” </p><p> “Is there air there?”</p><p> “There may be.”</p><p> “It’s a fine idea,” I said, “but it strikes me as</p><p>a large order all the same. The moon! I’d much </p><p>rather try some smaller things first.” </p><p> "They’re out of the question, because of the air</p><p>difficulty.” </p><p> “Why not apply that idea of spring blinds—</p><p>Cavorite blinds in strong steel cases—to lifting </p><p>weights?” </p><p> “It wouldn’t work,” he insisted. “After all, to</p><p>go into outer space is not so much worse, if at all, </p><p>than a polar expedition. Men go on polar expedi- </p><p>tions.” </p><p> “Not business men. And besides, they get paid</p><p>for polar expeditions. And if anything goes wrong </p><p>there are relief parties. But this—it’s just firing </p><p>ourselves off the world for nothing.” </p><p> “Call it prospecting.”</p><p> “You’ll have to call it that. . . . One might</p><p>make a book of it perhaps,” I said. </p><p> “I have no doubt there will be minerals,” said</p><p>Cavor. </p><p> “For example?”</p><p> “Oh! sulphur, ores, gold perhaps, possibly new</p><p>elements.” </p><p> “Cost of carriage,” I said. “You know you’re</p><p>not a practical man. The moon’s a quarter of a </p><p>million miles away.” </p><p> “It seems to me it wouldn’t cost much to cart</p><p>any weight anywhere if you packed it in a Cavor- </p><p>ite case.” </p><p> I had not thought of that. “Delivered free on</p><p>head of purchaser, eh?” </p><p> “It isn’t as though we were confined to the</p><p>moon.” </p><p> “You mean-?”</p><p> “There’s Mars—clear atmosphere, novel sur-</p><p>roundings, exhilarating sense of lightness. It </p><p>might be pleasant to go there.” </p><p> “Is there air on Mars?”</p><p> “Oh yes!”</p><p> “Seems as though you might run it as a sana-</p><p>torium. By the way, how far is Mars?” • </p><p> “Two hundred million miles at present,” said</p><p>Cavor airily; “and you go close by the sun.” </p><p> My imagination was picking itself up again.</p><p>“After all,” I said, “there’s something in these </p><p>things. There’s travel-” </p><p> An extraordinary possibility came rushing into</p><p>my mind. Suddenly I saw, as in a vision, the whole </p><p>solar system threaded with Cavorite liners and </p><p>spheres de luxe. “Rights of preemption,” came </p><p>floating into my head—planetary rights of pre- </p><p>emption. I recalled the old Spanish monopoly in </p><p>American gold. It wasn’t as though it was just </p><p>this planet or that—it was all of them. I stared at </p><p>Cavor’s rubicund face, and suddenly my imagina- </p><p>tion was leaping and dancing. I stood up, I walked </p><p>up and down; my tongue was unloosened. </p><p> “I’m beginning to take it in,” I said; “I’m be-</p><p>ginning to take it in.” The transition from doubt </p><p>to enthusiasm seemed to take scarcely any time at </p><p>all. “But this is tremendous!” I cried. “This </p><p>is Imperial! I haven’t been dreaming of this sort </p><p>of thing.” </p><p> Once the chill of my opposition was removed,</p><p>his own pent-up excitement had play. He ‘too </p><p>got up and paced. He too gesticulated and shout- </p><p>ed. We behaved like men inspired. We were men</p><p>inspired. </p><p> “We’ll settle all that!” he said in answer to some</p><p>incidental difficulty that had pulled me up. “We’ll </p><p>soon settle all that! We’ll start the drawings for </p><p>mouldings this very night.” </p><p> “We’ll start them now,” I responded, and we</p><p>hurried off to the laboratory to begin upon this </p><p>work forthwith. </p><p> I was like a child in Wonderland all that night.</p><p>784 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>The dawn found us both still at work—we kept our </p><p>electric light going heedless of the day. I remem- </p><p>ber now exactly how those drawings looked. I </p><p>shaded and tinted while Cavor drew—smudged </p><p>and haste-marked they were in every line, but </p><p>wonderfully correct. We got out the orders for </p><p>the steel blinds and frames we needed from that </p><p>night's work, and the glass sphere was designed </p><p>within a week. We gave up our afternoon conver- </p><p>sations and our old routine altogether. We worked, </p><p>and we slept and ate when we could work no longer </p><p>for hunger and fatigue. Our enthusiasm infected </p><p>even our three men, though they had no idea what </p><p>the sphere was for. Through those days the man </p><p>Gibbs gave up walking, and went everywhere, even </p><p>across the room, at a sort of fussy run. </p><p> And it grew—the sphere. December passed,</p><p>January—I spent a day with a broom sweeping a </p><p>path through the snow from bungalow to labora- </p><p>tory—February, March. By the end of March the </p><p>completion was in sight. In January had come a </p><p>team of horses, a huge packing-case; we had our </p><p>thick glass sphere now ready, and in position un- </p><p>der the crane we had rigged to sling it into the </p><p>steel shell. All the bars and blinds of the steel </p><p>shell—it was not really a spherical shell, but poly- </p><p>hedral, with a roller blind to each facet—had ar- </p><p>rived by February, and the lower half was bolted </p><p>together. The Cavorite was half made by March, </p><p>the metallic paste had gone through two of the </p><p>stages in its manufacture, and we had plastered </p><p>quite half of it on to the steel bars and blinds. It </p><p>was astonishing how closely we kept to the line of </p><p>Cavor’s first inspiration in working out the </p><p>scheme. When the bolting together of the sphere </p><p>was finished, he proposed to remove the rough roof </p><p>of the temporary laboratory in which the work was </p><p>done, and build a furnace about it. So the last </p><p>atage of Cavorite making, in which the paste is </p><p>heated to a dull red glow in a stream of helium, </p><p>would be accomplished when it was already on the </p><p>sphere. </p><p> And then we had to discuss and decide what</p><p>provisions we were to take—compressed foods, con- </p><p>centrated essences, steel cylinders containing re- </p><p>serve oxygen, an arrangement for removing car- </p><p>bonic acid and waste from the air and restoring </p><p>oxygen by means of sodium peroxide, water con- </p><p>densers, and so forth. I remember the little heap </p><p>they made in the corner—tins, and rolls, and boxes </p><p>—convincingly matter-of-fact. </p><p> It was a strenuous time, with little chance of</p><p>thinking. But one day, when we were drawing near </p><p>the end, an odd mood came over me. I had been </p><p>bricking up the furnace all the morning, and I sat </p><p>down by these possessions dead beat. Everything </p><p>seemed dull and incredible. </p><p> "But look here, Cavor,” I said. “After all!</p><p>What’s it all for?” </p><p> He smiled. "The thing now is to go.”</p><p> “The moon,” I reflected. “But what do you ex-</p><p>pect? I thought the moon was a dead world.” </p><p> He shrugged his shoulders.</p><p> “What do you expect?”</p><p> "We’re going to see.”</p><p> “Are wp?” T said, and starpd bpfore me.</p><p> “You are tired,” he remarked. “You’d Better</p><p>take a walk this afternoon.” </p><p> “No,” I said obstinately; “I’m going to finish this</p><p>brickwork.” </p><p> And I did, and insured myself a night of In-</p><p>somnia. </p><p> I don’t think I have ever had such a night. I</p><p>had some bad times before my business collapse, </p><p>but the very worst of these was sweet slumber com- </p><p>pared to this infinity of aching wakefulness. I was </p><p>suddenly in the most enormous funk at the thing </p><p>we were going to do. </p><p> I do not remember before that night thinking at</p><p>all of the risks we were running. Now they came </p><p>like that array of spectres that once beleaguered </p><p>Prague, and camped around me. The strangeness </p><p>of what we were about to do, the unearthliness of </p><p>it, overwhelmed me. I was like a man awakened </p><p>out of pleasant dreams to the most horrible sur- </p><p>roundings. I lay, eyes wide open, and the sphere </p><p>seemed to get more flimsy and feeble, and Cavor </p><p>more unreal and fantastic, and the whole enterprise </p><p>madder and madder every moment. </p><p> I got out of bed and wandered about. I sat at</p><p>the window and stared at the immensity of space. </p><p>Between the stars was the void, the unfathomable </p><p>darkness! I tried to recall the fragmentary knowl- </p><p>edge of astronomy I had gained in my irregular </p><p>reading, but it was all too vague to furnish any </p><p>idea of the things we might expect. At last I got</p><p>back to bed and snatched some moments of sleep— </p><p>moments of nightmare rather—in which I fell </p><p>and fell and fell for evermore into the abyss of the </p><p>sky. </p><p>I astonished Cavor at breakfast. I told him </p><p>shortly, "I’m not coming with you in the sphere.” </p><p>I met all his protests with a sullen persistence. </p><p>“The thing's too mad,” I said, “and I won’t come. </p><p>The thing’s too mad.” </p><p> I would not go with him to the laboratory. I</p><p>fretted about my bungalow for a time, and then </p><p>took hat and stick and set off alone, I knew not </p><p>whither. It chanced to be a glorious morning: a </p><p>warm wind and deep blue sky, the first green of </p><p>spring abroad, and multitudes of birds singing. I </p><p>lunched on beef and beer in a little public-house </p><p>near Elham, and startled the landlord by remarking </p><p>apropos of the weather, “A man who leaves the </p><p>world when days of this sort are about is a fooll” </p><p>“That's what I says when I heerd on it!” said the </p><p>landlord, and I found that for one poor soul at least </p><p>this world had proved excessive, and there had been </p><p>a throat-cutting. I went on with a new twist to </p><p>my thoughts. </p><p> In the afternoon I had a pleasant sleep in a sunny</p><p>place, and went my way refreshed. </p><p> I came to a comfortable-looking inn near Canter-</p><p>bury. It was bright with creepers, and the land- </p><p>lady was a clean old woman and took my eye. I </p><p>found I had just enough money to pay for my </p><p>lodging with her. I decided to stop the night there. </p><p>She was a talkative body, and among many other </p><p>particulars I learnt she had never been to London. </p><p>“Canterbury’s as far as ever I been,” she said. </p><p>“I’m not one of your gad-about sort.” </p><p> “How would you like a trip to the moon?” I cried.</p><p> "I never did hold with them ballooneys,” she said,</p><p>THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON </p><p>785 </p><p>evidently nnder the impression that thi3 was a </p><p>common excursion enough. “I wouldn’t go up in </p><p>one—not for ever so.” </p><p> This struck me as being funny. After I had</p><p>supped, I sat on a bench by the door of the inn </p><p>and gossiped with two labourers about brick-mak- </p><p>ing, and motor cars, and the cricket of last year. </p><p>And in the sky a faint new crescent, blue and vague </p><p>as a distant Alp, sank westward over the sun. </p><p> The next day I returned to Cavor. “I am com-</p><p>ing,” I said. I’ve been a little out of order that’s </p><p>all.” </p><p> That was the only time I felt any serious doubt</p><p>of our enterprise. Nerves purely! After that I </p><p>worked a little more carefully, and took a trudge for </p><p>an hour every day. And at last, save for the heating </p><p>in the furnace, our labours were at an end. </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>Inside the Sphere </p><p>on,” said Cavor, as I sat across the edge </p><p>f -w- of the manhole and looked down into the </p><p>V-l black interior of the sphere. We two were </p><p>alone. It was evening, the sun had set, and the </p><p>stillness of the twilight was upon everything. </p><p> I drew my other leg inside and slid down the</p><p>smooth glass to the bottom of the sphere, then </p><p>turned to take the cans of food and other impedi- </p><p>menta from Cavor. The interior was warm, the </p><p>thermometer stood at eighty, and as we should lose </p><p>little or none of this by radiation, we were dressed </p><p>in shoes and thin flannels. We had, however, a </p><p>bundle of thick woolen clothing and several thick </p><p>blankets to guard against mischance. By Cavor’s </p><p>direction I placed the packages, the cylinders of </p><p>oxygen, and so forth, loosely about my feet, and </p><p>soon we had everything in. He walked about the </p><p>roofless shed for a time seeking anything we had </p><p>overlooked, and then crawled in after me. I noted </p><p>something in his hand. </p><p> "What have you got there?” I asked.</p><p> “Haven’t you brought anything to read?”</p><p> “Good Lord! No.”</p><p> “I forgot to tell you. There are uncertainties-</p><p>The voyage may last- We may be weeks!” </p><p> "But-”</p><p> "We shall be floating in this sphere with ab-</p><p>solutely no occupation.” </p><p> "I wish I’d known-”</p><p> He peered out of the manhole. “Look!” he said.</p><p>“There’s something there!” </p><p> “Is there time?”</p><p> “We shall be an hour.”</p><p> I looked out. It was an old number of Tit-Bits</p><p>that one of the men must have brought. Farther </p><p>away in the corner I saw a torn Lloyd’s Neivs. I </p><p>scrambled back into the sphere with these things. </p><p>"What have you got?” I said. </p><p> I took the book from his hand and read, The</p><p>WorJcs of WiUiam Shakespeare.” </p><p> He coloured slightly. “My education has been</p><p>so purely scientific-” he said apologetically. </p><p> “Never read him?”</p><p> “Never.”</p><p> “He knew a little, you know—in an irregular</p><p>sort of way.” </p><p> “Precisely what I am told,” said Cavor.</p><p> I assisted him to screw in the glass cover of the</p><p>manhole, and then he pressed a stud to close the </p><p>corresponding blind in the outer case. The little </p><p>oblong of twilight vanished. We were in darkness. </p><p> For a time neither of us spoke. Although our</p><p>case would not be impervious to sound, everything </p><p>was very still. I perceived there was nothing to </p><p>grip when the shock of our start should come, and </p><p>I realised that I should be uncomfortable for want </p><p>of a chair. </p><p> “Why have we no chairs?” I asked.</p><p> “I’ve settled all that,” said Cavor. "We shan’t</p><p>need them.” </p><p> “Why not?”</p><p> 'Tou will see,” he said, in the tone of a man who</p><p>refuses to talk. </p><p> I became silent. Suddenly it had come to me</p><p>clear and vivid that I was a fool to be inside that </p><p>sphere. Even now, I asked myself, is it too late to </p><p>withdraw? The world outside the sphere, I knew, </p><p>would be cold and inhospitable enough to me—for </p><p>weeks I had been living on subsidies from Cavor— </p><p>but after all, would it be as cold as the infinite </p><p>zero, as inhospitable as empty space? If it had </p><p>not been for the appearance of cowardice, I believe </p><p>that even then I should have made him let me </p><p>out. But I hesitated on that score, and hesitated, </p><p>and grew fretful and angry, and the time passed. </p><p> There came a little jerk, a noise like champagne</p><p>being uncorked in another room, and a faint whist- </p><p>ling sound. For just one instant I had a sense of </p><p>enormous tension, a transient conviction that my </p><p>feet were pressing downward with a force of count- </p><p>less tons. It lasted for an infinitesimal time. </p><p> But it stirred me to action. “Cavor!” I said</p><p>into the darkness, “my nerve’s In rags. ... I don't </p><p>think-” </p><p> I stopped. He made no answer.</p><p> "Confound it!” I cried; “I’m a fool! What busi-</p><p>ness have I here? I’m not coming, Cavor. The </p><p>thing’s too risky. I’m getting out.” </p><p> "You can’t,” he said.</p><p> He made no answer for ten seconds. “It’s too</p><p>late for us to quarrel now, Bedford,” he said. "That </p><p>little jerk was the start. Already we are flying as </p><p>swiftly as a bullet up into the gulf of space.” </p><p> “I-” I said, and then it didn’t seem to matter</p><p>what happened. For a time I was, as it were, </p><p>stunned; I had nothing to say. It was just as if I </p><p>had never heard of this idea of leaving the world </p><p>before.' Then I perceived an unaccountable change </p><p>in my bodily sensations. It was a feeling of light- </p><p>ness, of unreality. Coupled with that was a queer </p><p>sensation in the head, an apoplectic effect almost, </p><p>and a thumping of blood-vessels at the ears. Neither </p><p>of these feelings diminished as time went on, but </p><p>at last I got so used to them that I experienced no </p><p>inconvenience. </p><p> I heard a click, and a little glow lamp came into</p><p>being. </p><p> I saw Cavor’s face, as white as I felt my own to</p><p>be. We regarded one another in silence. The trans- </p><p>parent blackness of the glass behind him made him </p><p>seem as though he floated in a void.</p><p> “Well, we’re committed,” I said at last.</p><p> 'Tes,” he said, “we’re committed.”</p><p>786 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> “Don’t move,” he exclaimed, at Bome suggestion</p><p>of a gesture. “Let your muscles keep quite lax </p><p>—as if you were in bed. We are in a little universe </p><p>of our own. Look at those things!” </p><p> He pointed to the loose cases and bundles that had</p><p>been lying on the blankets in the bottom of the </p><p>sphere. I was astonished to see that they were </p><p>floating now nearly a foot from the spherical wall. </p><p>Then I saw from his shadow that Cavor was no </p><p>longer leaning against the glass. I thrust out my </p><p>hand behind me, and found that I too was suspend- </p><p>ed in space, clear of the glass. </p><p> I did not cry nor gesticulate, but fear came upon</p><p>me. It was like being held and lifted by something </p><p>—you know not what. The mere touch of my hand </p><p>against the glass moved me rapidly. I understood </p><p>what had happened, but that did not prevent my </p><p>being afraid. We were cut off from all exterior </p><p>gravitation, only the attraction of objects within </p><p>our sphere had effect. Consequently everything </p><p>that was not fixed to the glass was falling—slowly </p><p>because of the slightness of our masses—towards </p><p>the centre of gravity of our little world, which seem- </p><p>ed to be somewhere about the middle of the sphere, </p><p>but rather nearer to myself than Cavor, on account </p><p>of my greater weight. </p><p> “We must turn round,” said Cavor, “and float</p><p>back to back, with the things between us.” </p><p> It was the strangest sensation conceivable, float-</p><p>ing thus loosely in space, at first indeed horribly </p><p>strange, and when the horror passed, not disagree- </p><p>able at all, exceedingly restful; indeed, the nearest </p><p>thing to it in earthly experience that I know is </p><p>lying on a very thick, soft feather bed. But the </p><p>quality of utter detachment and independence! I </p><p>had not reckoned on things like this. I had ex- </p><p>pected a violent jerk at starting, a giddy sense of </p><p>speed. Instead I felt—as if I were disembodied. It </p><p>was not like the beginning of a journey; it was like </p><p>the beginning of a dream. </p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>The Journey to the Moon </p><p>PRESENTLY Cavor extinguished the light. </p><p>He said we had not overmuch energy stored, </p><p>and that what we had we must economise for </p><p>reading. For a time, whether it was long or short </p><p>I do not know, there was nothing but blank dark- </p><p>ness. </p><p> A question floated up out of the void. “How are</p><p>we pointing?” I said. “What is our direction?” </p><p> “We are flying away from the earth at a tangent,</p><p>and as the moon is near her third quarter we are </p><p>going somewhere towards her. I will open a </p><p>blind-” </p><p> Came a click, and then a window in the outer</p><p>case yawned open. The sky outside was as black </p><p>as the darkness within the sphere, but the shape of </p><p>the open window was marked by an infinite number </p><p>of stars. </p><p> Those who have only seen the starry sky from</p><p>the earth cannot imagine its appearance when the </p><p>vague, half-luminous veil of our air has been with- </p><p>drawn. The stars we see on earth are the mere </p><p>scattered survivors that penetrate our misty atmo- </p><p>sphere. But now at last I could realise the meaning </p><p>of the hosts of heaven! </p><p> Stranger things we were presently to see, but</p><p>that airless, star-dusted sky! Of all things, I think </p><p>that will be one of the last I shall forget. </p><p> The little window vanished with a click, another,</p><p>beside it snapped open and instantly closed, and </p><p>then a third, and for a moment I had to close my </p><p>eyes because of the blinding splendour of the </p><p>waning moon. </p><p> For a space I had to stare at Cavor and the</p><p>white-lit things about me to season my eyes to light </p><p>again, before I could turn them towards that pallid </p><p>glare. </p><p> Four windows were open in order that the grav-</p><p>itation of the moon might act upon all the sub- </p><p>stances in our sphere. I found I was no longer </p><p>floating freely in space, but that my feet were </p><p>resting on the glass in the direction of the moon. </p><p>The blankets and cases of provisions were also </p><p>creeping slowly down the glass, and presently came </p><p>to rest so as to block out a portion of the view. </p><p>It seemed to me, of course, that I looked “down” </p><p>when I looked at the moon. On earth “down” </p><p>means earthward, the way things fall, and “up” the </p><p>reverse direction. Now the pull of gravitation was </p><p>towards the moon, and for all I knew to the contrary </p><p>our earth was overhead. And, of course, when all </p><p>the Cavorite blinds were closed, “down” was to- </p><p>wards the centre of our sphere, and “up” towards </p><p>its outer wall. </p><p> It was curiously unlike earthly experience, too,</p><p>to have the light coming up to one. On earth light</p><p>falls from above, or comes slanting down sideways, </p><p>but here it came from beneath our feet, and to </p><p>see our shadows we had to look up. </p><p> At first it gave me a sort of vertigo to stand only</p><p>on thick glass and look down upon the moon through </p><p>hundreds of thousands of miles of vacant space; </p><p>but this sickness passed very speedily. And then </p><p>—the splendour of the sight! </p><p> The reader may imagine it best if he will lie on</p><p>the ground some warm summer’s night and look </p><p>between his upraised feet at the moon, but for </p><p>some reason, probably because the absence of air </p><p>made it so much more luminous, the moon seemed </p><p>already considerably larger than it does from earth. </p><p>The minutest details of its surface were acutely </p><p>clear. And since we did not see it through air, </p><p>its outline was bright and sharp, there was no glow </p><p>or halo about it, and the star-dust that covered the </p><p>sky came right to its very margin, and marked the </p><p>outline of its unilluminated part. And as I stood </p><p>and stared at the moon between my feet, that per- </p><p>ception of the impossible that had been with me </p><p>off and on ever since our start, returned again with </p><p>tenfold conviction. </p><p> “Cavor,” I said, “this takes me queerly. Those</p><p>companies we were going to run, and all that about </p><p>minerals ?” </p><p> “I don’t see ’em here.”</p><p> “No,” said Cavor; "but you’ll get over all that.”</p><p> “I suppose I’m made to turn right side up again.</p><p>Still, this- For a moment I could half believe </p><p>there never was a world.” </p><p> “That copy of Lloyd's News might help you.”</p><p> I stared at the paper for a moment, then held</p><p>THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON </p><p>787 </p><p>it above the level of my face, and found I could </p><p>read it quite easily. I struck a column of mean </p><p>little advertisements. “A gentleman of private </p><p>means is willing to lend money,” I read. I knew </p><p>that gentleman. Then somebody eccentric wanted </p><p>to sell a Cutaway bicycle, “quite new and cost £15,” </p><p>for five pounds; and a lady in distress wished to </p><p>dispose of some fish knives and forks, “a wedding </p><p>present,” at a great sacrifice. No doubt some sim- </p><p>ple soul was sagely examining these knives and </p><p>forks, and another triumphantly riding off on that </p><p>bicycle, and a third trustfully consulting that </p><p>benevolent gentleman of means even as I read. I </p><p>laughed, and let the paper drift from my hand. </p><p>“Are we visible from the earth?” I asked. </p><p> "Why?”</p><p> "I knew some one who was rather interested in</p><p>astronomy. It occurred to me that it would be </p><p>rather odd if—my friend—chanced to be looking </p><p>through some telescope.” </p><p> “It would need the most powerful telescope on</p><p>earth even now to see us as the minutest speck.” </p><p>For a time I stared in silence at the moon. </p><p> “It’s a world,” I said; “one feels that infinitely</p><p>more than one ever did on earth. People per- </p><p>haps-” </p><p> "People!” he exclaimed. "No! Banish all that!</p><p>Think yourself a sort of ultra-arctic voyager ex- </p><p>ploring the desolate places of space. Look at it!” </p><p>He waved his hand at the shining whiteness be- </p><p>low. "It’s dead—dead! Vast extinct volcanoes, </p><p>lava wildernesses, tumbled wastes of snow, or frozen </p><p>carbonic acid, or frozen air, and everywhere land- </p><p>slip seams and cracks and gulfs. Nothing happens. </p><p>Men have watched this planet systematically with </p><p>telescopes for over two hundred years. How much </p><p>change do you- think they have seen?” </p><p> "None.”</p><p> "They have traced two indisputable landslips, a</p><p>doubtful crack, and one slight periodic change of </p><p>colour, and that’s all.” </p><p> "I didn’t know they’d traced even that.”</p><p> "Oh, yes. But as for people!”</p><p> “By the way,” I asked, “how small a thing will</p><p>the biggest telescopes show upon the moon?”</p><p> “One could see a fair-sized church. One could</p><p>certainly see any towns or buildings, or anything </p><p>like the handiwork of men. There might perhaps </p><p>be insects, something in the way of ants, for ex- </p><p>ample, so that they could hide in deep burrows from </p><p>the lunar night, or some new sort of creatures </p><p>having no earthly parallel. That is the most prob- </p><p>able thing, if we are to find life there at all. Think </p><p>of the difference in conditions! Life must fit itself </p><p>to a day as long as fourteen earthly days, a cloudless </p><p>sun-blaze of fourteen days, and then a night of </p><p>equal length, growing ever colder and colder under </p><p>these cold, sharp stars. In that night there must </p><p>be cold, the ultimate cold, absolute zero, 273°C. </p><p>below the earthly freezing point. Whatever life </p><p>there is must hibernate through that, and rise again </p><p>each day.” </p><p> He mused. “One can imagine something worm-</p><p>like,” he said, “taking its air solid as an earth-worm </p><p>swallows earth, or thick-skinned monsters-” </p><p> “By the bye,” I said, “why didn’t we bring ft</p><p>gun?” </p><p> He did not answer that question. “No,” he con-</p><p>cluded, “we just have to go. We shall see when </p><p>we get there.” </p><p> I remembered something. “Of course, there’3</p><p>my minerals, anyhow,” I said; “whatever the condi- </p><p>tions may be.” </p><p> Presently he told me he wished to alter our course</p><p>a little by letting the earth tug at us for a moment. </p><p>He was going to open one earthward blind fon </p><p>thirty seconds. He warned me that it would make </p><p>my head swim, and advised me to extend my hands </p><p>against the glass to break my fall. I did as he </p><p>directed, and thrust my feet against the bales of </p><p>food cases and air cylinders to prevent their falling </p><p>upon me. Then with a click the window flew open, </p><p>I fell clumsily upon hands and face, and saw for a </p><p>moment between my black extended fingers our </p><p>mother earth—a planet in a downward sky. </p><p> We were still very near—Cavor told me the dis-</p><p>tance was perhaps eight hundred miles and the </p><p>huge terrestrial disc filled all heaven. But already </p><p>it was plain to see that the world was a globe. </p><p>The land below us was in twilight and vague, but: </p><p>westward the vast gray stretches of the Atlantic? </p><p>shone like molten silver under the receding day, </p><p>I think I recognised the cloud-dimmed coast-linea </p><p>of France and Spain and the south of England, </p><p>and then, with a click, the shutter closed again, and </p><p>I found myself in a state of extraordinary confusion,</p><p>sliding slowly over the smooth glass. </p><p> When at last things settled themselves in my</p><p>mind again, it seemed quite beyond question that </p><p>the moon was “down” and under my feet, and that </p><p>the earth was somewhere away on the level of the </p><p>horizon—the earth that had been “down” to me </p><p>and my kindred since the beginning of things. </p><p> So slight were the exertions required of us, so</p><p>easy did the practical annihilation of our weight </p><p>make all we had to do, that the necessity for taking </p><p>refreshment did not occur to us for nearly six hours </p><p>(by Cavor’s chronometer) after our start. I was </p><p>amazed at that lapse of time. Even then I was </p><p>satisfied with very little. Cavor examined the ap- </p><p>paratus for absorbing carbonic acid and water, and </p><p>pronounced it to be in satisfactory order, our con- </p><p>sumption of oxygen having been extraordinarily </p><p>slight. And our talk being exhausted for the time, </p><p>and there being nothing further for us to do, we </p><p>gave way to a curious drowsiness that had come </p><p>upon us, and spreading our blankets on the bottom </p><p>of the sphere in such a manner as to shut out most </p><p>of the moonlight, wished each other good-night, and </p><p>almost immediately fell asleep. </p><p> And so, sleeping, and sometimes talking and read-</p><p>ing a little, and at times eating, although without </p><p>any keenness of appetite,1 but for the most part in </p><p>a sort of quiescence that was neither waking nor </p><p>slumber, we fell through a space of time that had </p><p> JIt is a curious thing, that while we were in the sphere we felt not</p><p>the slightest desire for food, nor did we feel the want of it when wa </p><p>abstained. At first we forced our appetites, but afterwards we fasted </p><p>completely. Altogether we did not consume one-hundredth part of the </p><p>compressed provisions we had brought with us. The amount of car- </p><p>bonic acid we breathed out was unnaturally low, but why this was so </p><p>I am quite unable to explain. </p><p>788 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>neither night nor day in it, silently, softly, and </p><p>swiftly down towards the moon. </p><p>CHAPTER VI </p><p>The Landing on the Moon </p><p>1 REMEMBER how one day Cavor suddenly </p><p>opened six of our shutters and blinded me so </p><p>that I cried aloud at him. The whole area was </p><p>moon, a stupendous scimitar of white dawn with </p><p>its edge hacked out by notches of darkness, the </p><p>orescent shore of an ebbing tide of darkness, out of </p><p>which peaks and pinnacles came climbing into the </p><p>blaze of the sun. I take it the reader has seen pic- </p><p>tures or photographs of the moon, so that I need </p><p>not describe the broader features of that landscape, </p><p>those spacious ring-like ranges vaster than any </p><p>terrestrial mountains, their summits shining in the </p><p>day, their shadows harsh and deep, the gray dis- </p><p>ordered plains, the ridges, hills, and craterlets, all </p><p>passing at last from a blazing illumination into a </p><p>common mystery of black. Athwart this world we </p><p>were flying scarcely a hundred miles above its crest </p><p>and pinnacles. And now we could see, what no eye </p><p>on earth will ever see, that under the blaze of the </p><p>day the harsh outlines of the rocks and ravines of </p><p>the plains and crater floor grew gray and indistinct </p><p>under a thickening haze, that the white of their lit </p><p>surfaces broke into lumps and patches, and broke </p><p>again and shrank and vanished, and that here and </p><p>there strange tints of brown and olive grew and </p><p>spread. </p><p> But little time we had for watching then. For</p><p>now we had come to the real danger of our journey. </p><p>We had to drop ever closer to the moon as we spun </p><p>about it, to slacken our pace and watch our chance, </p><p>until at last we could dare to drop upon its surface. </p><p> For Cavor that was a time of intense exertion;</p><p>for me it was an anxious inactivity. I seemed per- </p><p>petually to be getting out of his way. He leapt </p><p>about the sphere from point to point with an </p><p>agility that would have been impossible on earth. </p><p>He was perpetually opening and closing the Cavor- </p><p>ite windows, making calculations, consulting his </p><p>chronometer by means of the glow lamp during those </p><p>last eventful hours. For a long time we had all our </p><p>windows closed and hung silently in darkness hurl- </p><p>ing through space. </p><p> Then he was feeling for the shutter studs, and</p><p>suddenly four windows were open. I staggered </p><p>and covered my eyes, drenched and scorched and </p><p>blinded by the unaccustomed splendour of the sun</p><p>beneath my feet. Then again the shutters snapped, </p><p>leaving my brain spinning in a darkness that pres- </p><p>sed against the eyes. And after that I floated in </p><p>another vast, black silence. </p><p> Then Cavor switched on the electric light, and</p><p>told me he proposed to bind all our luggage together </p><p>with the blankets about it, against the concussion </p><p>of our descent. We did this with our windows </p><p>closed, because in that way our goods arranged </p><p>themselves naturally at the centre of the sphere. </p><p>That too was a strange business; we two men float- </p><p>ing loose in that spherical space, and packing and </p><p>pulling ropes. Imagine it if you can! No up nor </p><p>down, and every effort resulting in unexpected </p><p>movements. Now I would be pressed against the </p><p>glass with the full force of Cavor’s thrust, now 1 </p><p>would be kicking helplessly in a void. Now the </p><p>star of the electric light would be overhead, now un- </p><p>der foot Now Cavor’s feet would float up before </p><p>my eyes, and now we would be crossways to each </p><p>other. But at last our goods were safely bound </p><p>together in a big soft bale, all except two blankets </p><p>with head holes that we were to wrap about our- </p><p>selves. </p><p> Then for a flash Cavor opened a window moon-</p><p>ward, and we saw that we were dropping towards </p><p>a huge central crater with a number of minor </p><p>craters grouped in a sort of cross about it. And </p><p>then again Cavor flung our little sphere open to the </p><p>scorching, blinding sun. I think he was using the </p><p>sun's attraction as a brake. “Cover yourself with </p><p>a blanket,” he cried, thrusting himself from me, and </p><p>for a moment I did not understand. </p><p> Then I hauled the blanket from beneath my feet</p><p>and got it about me and over my head and eyes. </p><p>Abruptly he closed the shutters again, snapped </p><p>one open again and closed it, then suddenly began </p><p>snapping them all open, each safely into its steel </p><p>roller. There came a jar, and then we were roll- </p><p>ing over and over, bumping against the glass and </p><p>against the big bale of our luggage, and clutching </p><p>at each other, and outside some white substance </p><p>splashed as if we were rolling down a slope of </p><p>snow. . . . </p><p> Over, clutch, bump, clutch, bump, over. . . .</p><p> Came a thud, and I was half buried under the</p><p>bale of our possessions, and for a space everything </p><p>was still. Then I could hear Cavor puffing and </p><p>grunting, and the snapping of a shutter in its sash. </p><p>I made an effort, thrust back our blanket-wrapped </p><p>luggage, and emerged from beneath it Our open </p><p>windows were just visible as a deeper black set with</p><p>stars. </p><p> We were still alive, and we were lying in the</p><p>darkness of the shadow of the wall of the great </p><p>crater into which we had fallen. </p><p> We sat getting our breath again, and feeling the</p><p>bruises on our limbs. I don’t think either of us </p><p>had had a very clear expectation of such rough </p><p>handling as we had received. I struggled painfully </p><p>to my feet. “And now,” said I, “to look at the </p><p>landscape of the moon! But-! It’s tremen- </p><p>dously dark, Cavor!” </p><p> The glass was dewy, and as I spoke I wiped at</p><p>it with my blanket. "We're half an hour or so </p><p>beyond the day,” he said. “We must wait.” </p><p> It was impossible to distinguish anything. We</p><p>might have been in a sphere of steel for all that </p><p>we could see. My rubbing with the blanket simply </p><p>smeared the glass, and as fast as I wiped it, it </p><p>became opaque again with freshly condensed mois- </p><p>ture mixed with an increasing quantity of blanket </p><p>hairs. Of course I ought not to have used the </p><p>blanket. In my efforts to clear the glass I slipped </p><p>upon the damp surface, and hurt my shin against </p><p>one of the oxygen cylinders that protruded from our </p><p>bale. </p><p> The thing was exasperating—it was absurd. Here</p><p>we were just arrived upon the moon, amidst we </p><p>knew not what wonders, and all we could see was </p><p>THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON </p><p>789 </p><p>the gray and streaming wall of the bubble in which </p><p>we had come. </p><p> “Confound it!” I said, “but at this rate we might</p><p>have stopped at home;” and I squatted on the bale </p><p>and shivered, and drew my blanket closer about </p><p>me. </p><p> Abruptly the moisture turned to spangles and</p><p>fronds of frost. “Can you reach the electric heater,” </p><p>said Cavor. “Yes—that black knob. Or we shall </p><p>freeze.” </p><p> I did not wait to be told twice. “And now,” said</p><p>I, “what are we to do?” </p><p> “Wait,” he said. “Of course. We shall have to</p><p>wait until our air gets warm again, and then this </p><p>glass will clear. We can’t do anything till then. </p><p>It’s night here yet; we must wait for the day to </p><p>overtake us. Meanwhile, don’t you feel hungry?" </p><p> For a space I did not answer him, but sat fretting.</p><p>I turned reluctantly from the smeared puzzle of </p><p>the glass and stared at his face. “Yes,” I said, “I </p><p>am hungry. I feel somehow enormously disap- </p><p>pointed. I had expected—I don’t know what I had </p><p>expected, but not this.” </p><p> I summoned my philosophy, and rearranging my</p><p>blanket about me sat down on the bale again and </p><p>began my first meal on the moon. I don’t think I </p><p>finished it—I forget. Presently, first in patches, </p><p>then running rapidly together into wider spaces, </p><p>came the clearing of the glass, came the drawing </p><p>of the misty veil that hid the moon world from our </p><p>eyes. </p><p> Wc peered out upon the landscape of the</p><p>moon. </p><p>CHAPTER VII </p><p>Sunrise on the Moon </p><p>AS we saw it first it was the wildest and moat </p><p>desolate of scenes. We were in an enormous </p><p>amphitheatre, a vast circular plain, the </p><p>floor of the giant crater. Its cliff-like walls closed </p><p>us in on every side. From the westward the light </p><p>of the unseen sun fell upon them, reaching to the </p><p>very foot of the cliff, and showed a disordered </p><p>escarpment of drab and grayish rock, lined here and </p><p>there with banks and crevices of snow. This was </p><p>perhaps a dozen miles away but at first no interven-</p><p>ing atmosphere diminished in the slightest the </p><p>minutely detailed brilliancy with which these things </p><p>glared at us. They stood out clear and dazzling </p><p>against a background of starry blackness that seem- </p><p>ed to our earthly eyes rather a gloriously spangled </p><p>velvet curtain than the spaciousness of the sky. </p><p> The eastward cliff was at first merely a starless</p><p>selvedge to the starry dome. No rosy flush, no </p><p>creeping pallor, announced the commencing day. </p><p>Only the Corona, the Zodiacal light, a huge cone- </p><p>shaped, luminous haze, pointing up towards the </p><p>splendour of the morning star, warned us of the </p><p>imminent nearness of the sun. </p><p> Whatever light was about us was reflected by</p><p>the westward cliffs. It showed a huge undulating </p><p>plain, cold and gray, a gray that deepened eastward </p><p>into the absolute raven darkness of the cliff shadow. </p><p>Innumerable rounded gray summits, ghostly hum- </p><p>mocks, billows of snowy substance, stretching crest </p><p>beyond crest into the remote obscurity, gave us our </p><p>first inkling of the distance of the crater walL </p><p>These hummocks looked like snow. At the time I </p><p>thought they were snow. But they were not—they </p><p>were mounds and masses of frozen air! </p><p> So it was at first, and then, sudden, swift, and</p><p>amazing, came the lunar day. </p><p> The sunlight had crept down the cliff, it touched</p><p>the drifted masses at its base and incontinently </p><p>came striding with seven-leagued boots towards us. </p><p>The distant cliff seemed to shift and quiver, and at </p><p>the touch of the dawn a reek of gray vapour poured </p><p>upward from the crater floor, whirls and puffs and </p><p>drifting wraiths of gray, thicker and broader and </p><p>denser, until at last the whole westward plain was </p><p>steaming like a wet handkerchief held before the </p><p>fire, and the westward cliffs were no more than a </p><p>refracted glare beyond. </p><p> “It is air,” said Cavor. “It must be air—or it</p><p>would not rise like this—at the mere touch of a </p><p>sunbeam. And at this pace. . . .” </p><p> He peered upwards. “Look!” he said.</p><p> “What?” I asked.</p><p> “In the sky. Already. On the blackness—a little</p><p>touch of blue. See! The stars seem larger. And </p><p>tht little ones and all those dim nebulosities we saw </p><p>in empty space—they are hidden!” </p><p> Swiftly, steadily, the day approached us. Gray</p><p>summit after gray summit was overtaken by the</p><p>blaze, and turned to a smoking white intensity. At </p><p>last there was nothing to the west of us but a bank </p><p>of surging fog, the tumultuous advance and ascent </p><p>of cloudy haze. The distant cliff had receded </p><p>farther and farther, had loomed and changed </p><p>through the whirl, and foundered and vanished at </p><p>last in its confusion. </p><p> Nearer came that steaming advance, nearer and</p><p>nearer, coming as fast as the shadow of a cloud </p><p>before the south-west wind. About us rose a thin </p><p>anticipatory haze. </p><p> Cavor gripped my arm.</p><p> “What?” I said.</p><p> “Look! The sunrise! The sun!”</p><p> He turned me about and pointed to the brow of</p><p>the eastward cliff, looming above the haze about us, </p><p>scarce lighter than the darkness of the sky. But </p><p>now its line was marked by strange reddish shapes, </p><p>tongues of vermilion flame that writhed and danced. </p><p>I fancied it must be spirals of vapour that had </p><p>caught the light and made this crest of fiery tongues </p><p>against the sky, but indeed it was the solar prom- </p><p>inences I saw, a crown of fire about the sun that </p><p>is forever hidden from earthly eyes by our atmos- </p><p>pheric veil. </p><p> And then—the sun!</p><p> Steadily, inevitably came a brilliant line, came</p><p>a thin edge of intolerable effulgence that took a </p><p>circular shape, became a bow, became a blazing </p><p>sceptre, and hurled a shaft of heat at us as though </p><p>it was a spear. </p><p> It seemed verily to stab my eyes! I cried aloud</p><p>and turned about blinded, groping for my blanket </p><p>beneath the bale. </p><p> And with that incandescence came a sound, the</p><p>first sound that had reached us from without since </p><p>we left the earth, a hissing and rustling, the stormy. </p><p>790 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>trailing of the aerial garment of the advancing </p><p>day. And with the coining of the sound and the </p><p>light the sphere lurched, and blinded and dazzled </p><p>we staggered helplessly against each other. It </p><p>lurched again, and the hissing grew louder. I had </p><p>shut my eyes perforce, I was making clumsy efforts </p><p>to cover my head with my blanket, and this second </p><p>lurch sent me helplessly off my feet. I fell against </p><p>the bale, and opening my eyes had a momentary </p><p>glimpse of the air just outside our glass. It was </p><p>running—it was boiling—like snow into which a </p><p>white-hot rod is thrust. What had been solid air </p><p>had suddenly at the touch of the sun become a </p><p>paste, a mud, a slushy liquefaction, that hissed and </p><p>bubbled into gas. </p><p> There came a still more violent whirl of the sphere</p><p>and we had clutched one another. In another </p><p>moment we were spun about again. Round we </p><p>went and over, and then I was on all fours. The </p><p>lunar dawn had hold of us. It meant to show us </p><p>little men what the moon could do with us. </p><p> I caught a second glimpse of things without,</p><p>puffs of vapour, half-liquid slush, excavated, sliding, </p><p>falling, sliding. We dropped into darkness. I went </p><p>down with Cavor’s knees in my chest. Then he </p><p>seemed to fly away from me, and for a moment I </p><p>lay with all the breath out of my body staring </p><p>upward. A toppling crag of the melting stiflT~iiHu </p><p>splashed over us, buried us, and now it thinned and </p><p>boiled off us. I saw the bubbles dancing on the </p><p>glass above. I heard Cavor exclaiming feebly. </p><p> Then some huge landship in the thawing air had</p><p>caught us, and spluttering expostulation, we began </p><p>to roll down a slope, rolling faster and faster, leap- </p><p>ing crevasses and rebounding from banks, faster and </p><p>faster, westward into the white-hot boiling tumult </p><p>of the lunar day. </p><p> Clutching at one another we spun about, pitched</p><p>this way and that, our bale of packages leaping at </p><p>us, pounding at us. We collided, we gripped, we </p><p>were torn asunder—our heads met, and the whole </p><p>universe burst into fiery darts and stars! On the </p><p>earth we should have smashed one another a dozen </p><p>times, but on the moon, luckily for us, our weight </p><p>was only one-sixth of what it is terrestrially, and </p><p>we fell very mercifully. I recall a sensation of utter </p><p>sickness, a feeling as if my brain were upside down </p><p>within my skull, and then- </p><p> Something was at work upon my face, some thin</p><p>feelers worried my ears. Then I discovered the</p><p>brilliance of the landscape around was mitigated </p><p>by blue spectacles. Cavor bent over me, and I </p><p>saw his face upside down, his eyes also protected </p><p>by tinted goggles. His breath came irregularly, and </p><p>his lip was bleeding from a bruise. “Better?” he </p><p>said, wiping the blood with the back of his hand. </p><p> Everything seemed swaying for a space, but that</p><p>was simply my giddiness. I perceived that he had </p><p>closed some of the shutters in the outer sphere to </p><p>save me from the direct blaze of the sun. I was </p><p>aware that everything about us was very brilliant. </p><p> “Lord!” I gasped. “But this-!”</p><p> I craned my neck to see. I perceived there was</p><p>a blinding glare outside, an utter change from the </p><p>gloomy darkness of our first impressions. “Have </p><p>I been insensible long?” I asked. </p><p> “I don’t know—the chronometer is broken. Some</p><p>little time. . . . My dear chap! I have been </p><p>afraid. . . </p><p> I lay for a space taking this in. I saw his face</p><p>still bore evidences of emotion. For a while I said </p><p>nothing. I passed an inquisitive hand over my </p><p>contusions, and surveyed his face for similar </p><p>damages. The back of my right hand had suffered </p><p>most, and was skinless and raw. My forehead was </p><p>bruised and had bled. He handed me a little </p><p>measure with some of the restorative—I forget the </p><p>name of it—he had brought with us. After a time </p><p>I felt a little better. I began to stretch my limbs </p><p>carefully. Soon I could talk. </p><p> “It wouldn’t have done,” I said, as though there</p><p>had been no interval. </p><p> “No! it wouldn't."</p><p> He thought, his hands hanging over his knees.</p><p>He peered through the glass and then stared at </p><p>me. “Good Lord!” he said. “No!” </p><p> “What has happened?” I asked after a pause.</p><p>“Have we jumped to the tropics?” </p><p> “It was as I expected. This air has evaporated—</p><p>if it is air. At any rate, it has evaporated, and </p><p>the surface of the moon is showing. We are lying </p><p>on a bank of earthy rock. Here and there bare </p><p>soil is exposed. A queer sort of soil!” </p><p> It occurred to him that it was unnecessary to</p><p>explain. He assisted me into a sitting position, </p><p>and I could see with my own eyes. </p><p> CHAPTER VIII</p><p> A Lunar Morning</p><p>THE harsh emphasis, the pitiless black and </p><p>white of the scenery had altogether disap- </p><p>peared. The glare of the sun had taken upon </p><p>itself a faint tinge of amber; the shadows upon the </p><p>cliff of the crater wall were deeply purple. To the </p><p>eastward a dark bank of fog still crouched and </p><p>sheltered from the sunrise, but to the westward the </p><p>sky was blue and clear. I began to realise the length </p><p>of my insensibility. </p><p> We were no longer in a void. An atmosphere</p><p>had arisen about us. The outline of things had </p><p>gained in character, had grown acute and varied; </p><p>save for a shadowed space of white substances here </p><p>and there, white substance that was no longer air </p><p>but snow, the arctic appearance had gone altogether. </p><p>Everywhere broad rusty brown spaces of bare and </p><p>tumbled earth spread to the blaze of the sun. Here </p><p>and there at the edge of the snowdrifts were trans- </p><p>ient little pools and eddies of water, the only things </p><p>stirring in that expanse of barrenness. The sun- </p><p>light inundated the upper two blinds of our sphere </p><p>and turned our climate to high summer, but our feet </p><p>were still in shadow, and the sphere was lying upon </p><p>a drift of snow.	^</p><p> And scattered here and there upon the slope, and</p><p>emphasised by little white threads of unthawed </p><p>snow upon their shady sides, were shapes like </p><p>sticks, dry twisted sticks of the same rusty hue </p><p>as the rock upon which they lay. That caught </p><p>one’s thoughts sharply. Sticks! On a lifeless </p><p>world? Then as my eye grew more accustomed to </p><p>the texture of their substance, I perceived that al- </p><p>THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON </p><p>791 </p><p>most all this surface had a fibrous texture, like </p><p>the carpet of brown needles one finds beneath the </p><p>shade of pine trees. </p><p> "Cavor!” I said.</p><p> "Yes.”</p><p> "It may be a dead world now—but once-”</p><p> Something arrested my attention. I had dis-</p><p> covered among these needles a number of little</p><p> round objects. And It seemed to me that one of</p><p> these had moved.</p><p> “Cavor,” I whispered.</p><p> “What?”</p><p> But I did not answer at once. I stared incredulous.</p><p> For an instant I could not believe my eyes. I gave</p><p> an inarticulate cry. I gripped his arm. I pointed.</p><p> “Look!” I cried, finding my tongue. “There!</p><p> Yes! And there!”</p><p> His eyes followed my pointing finger. “Eh?”</p><p> he said.</p><p> How can I describe the thing I saw? It is so</p><p> petty a thing to state, and yet it seemed so wonder-</p><p> ful, so pregnant with emotion. I have said that</p><p> amidst the stick-like litter were these rounded</p><p> bodies, these little oval bodies that might have</p><p> passed as very small pebbles. And now first one</p><p> and then another had stirred, had rolled over and</p><p> cracked, and down the crack of each of them show-</p><p> ed a minute line of yellowish green, thrusting out-</p><p> ward to meet the hot encouragement of the newly-</p><p> risen sun. For a moment that was all, and then</p><p> there stirred and burst a third!</p><p> “It is a seed,” said Cavor. And then I heard him</p><p> whisper very softly, "Life!"</p><p> “Life!” And immediately it poured upon us that</p><p> our vast journey had not been made in vain, that</p><p> we had come to no arid waste of minerals, but to</p><p> a world that lived and moved! We watched in-</p><p> . tensely. I remember I kept rubbing the glass be-</p><p> fore me with my sleeve, jealous of the faintest</p><p> suspicion of mist.</p><p> The picture was clear and vivid only in the mid-</p><p> dle of the field. All about that centre the dead</p><p> fibres and seeds were magnified and distorted by</p><p> the curvature of the glass. But we could see</p><p> enough! One after another all down the sunlit</p><p> slope these miraculous little brown bodies burst and</p><p> gaped apart, like seed-pods, like the husks of</p><p> fruits; opened eager mouths that drank in the heat</p><p> and light pouring in a cascade from the newly-risen</p><p> sun.</p><p> Every moment more of these seed-coats ruptured,</p><p> and even as they did so the swelling pioneers over-</p><p> flowed their rent-distended seed-cases, and passed</p><p> into the second stage of growth. With a steady</p><p> assurance, a swift deliberation, these amazing seeds</p><p> thrust a rootlet downward to the ground and a queer</p><p> little bundle-like bud into the air. In a little while</p><p> the whole slope was dotted with minute plantlets</p><p> standing at attention in the blaze of the sun.</p><p> They did not stand for long. The bundle-like</p><p> buds swelled and strained and opened with a jerk,</p><p> thrusting out a coronet of little sharp tips, spread-</p><p> ing a whorl of tiny, spiky, brownish leaves, that</p><p>lengthened rapidly, lengthened visibly even as we </p><p>watched. The 'movement was slower than any </p><p>animal’s, swifter than any plant’s I have ever seen </p><p>before. How can I suggest it to you—the way that </p><p>growth went on? The leaf tips grew so that they </p><p>moved onward even while we looked at them. The </p><p>brown seed-case shrivelled and was absorbed with </p><p>an equal rapidity. Have you ever on a cold day </p><p>taken a thermometer into your warm hand and </p><p>watched the little thread of mercury creep up the </p><p>tube? These moon plants grew like that. </p><p> In a few minutes, as it seemed, the buds of the</p><p>more forward of these plants had lengthened into </p><p>a stem and were even putting forth a second whorl </p><p>of leaves, and all the slope that had seemed so </p><p>recently a lifeless stretch of litter was now dark </p><p>with the stunted olive-green herbage of bristling </p><p>spikes that swayed with the vigour of their grow- </p><p>ing. </p><p> I turned about, and behold! along the upper</p><p>edge of a rock to the eastward a similar fringe in </p><p>a scarcely less forward condition swayed and bent, </p><p>dark against the blinding glare of the sun. And </p><p>beyond this fringe was the silhouette of a plant </p><p>mass, branching clumsily like a cactus, and swelling </p><p>visibly, swelling like a bladder that fills with air. </p><p> Then to the westward also I discovered that an-</p><p>other such distended form was rising over the </p><p>scrub. But here the light fell upon its sleek sides, </p><p>and I could see that its colour was a vivid orange </p><p>hue. It rose as one watched it; if one looked away </p><p>from it for a minute and then back, its outline had</p><p>changed; it thrust out blunt congested branches </p><p>until in a little time it rose a coralline shape of </p><p>many feet in height. Compared with such a growth </p><p>the terrestrial puff-ball, which will sometimes swell </p><p>a foot in diameter in a single night, would be a </p><p>hopeless laggard. But than the puff-ball grows </p><p>against a gravitational pull six times that of the </p><p>moon. Beyond, out of gullies and flats that had </p><p>been hidden from us, but not from the quickening </p><p>sun, over reefs and banks of shining rock, a bristling </p><p>beard of spiky and fleshy vegetation was straining </p><p>into view, hurrying tumultuously to take advantage </p><p>of the brief day in which it must flower and fruit </p><p>and seed again and die. It was like a miracle, that </p><p>growth. So, one must imagine, the trees and plants </p><p>arose at the Creation and covered the desolation of </p><p>the new-made earth. </p><p> Imagine it! Imagine that dawn! The resur-</p><p>rection of the frozen air, the stirring and quicken- </p><p>ing of the soil, and then this silent uprising of </p><p>vegetation, this unearthly ascent of fleshiness and </p><p>spikes. Conceive it all lit by a blaze that would </p><p>make the intensest sunlight of earth seem watery </p><p>and weak. And still around this stirring jungle, </p><p>wherever there was shadow, lingered banks of bluish </p><p>snow. And to have the picture of our impression </p><p>complete, you must bear in mind that we saw it all </p><p>through a thick bent glass, distorting it as things </p><p>are distorted by a lens, acute only in the centre of </p><p>the picture, and very bright there, and towards the </p><p>edges magnified and unreal. </p><p>(To be continued next month) </p><p>Man Higher Up </p><p>j&amp;if£dwin (Bctlmer and ^MUiam 3. cM[gcHarcf </p><p>Author’s of “The Eleventh Hour” and “The Hammering Man” </p><p>Trant substituted lor tho photograph the bent wire given him by Mias Rowan.

And for the last five </p><p>days, during which the Weather Bureau’s storm </p><p>signals had stayed steadily set, no steamer of the </p><p>six which had finished unloading at the docks the </p><p>week before had dared to try for the open sea ex- </p><p>cept one, the Elizabethan Age, which had cleared </p><p>the Narrows on Monday night. </p><p> On land the storm was scarcely less disastrous to</p><p>the business of the great importing company. Since </p><p>Tuesday morning Rentland’s reports of the car- </p><p>and train-load consignments which had left the </p><p>warehouses daily had been a monotonous page of </p><p>trains stalled. But until that Friday morning, </p><p>Welter—the big, bull-necked, thick-lipped master of </p><p>men and money—had borne all the accumulated </p><p>trouble of the week with serenity, almost with con- </p><p>tempt. Only when the chief clerk added to his re- </p><p>port the minor item that the 3,000-ton steamer, </p><p>Elizabethan Age, which had cleared on Monday </p><p>night, had been driven into Boston, something sud- </p><p>denly seemed to “break” in the inner office. Rent- </p><p>land heard the president’s secretary telephone to </p><p>Brooklyn for Rowan, the dock superintendent; he </p><p>heard Welter’s heavy steps going to and fro in the </p><p>private office, his hoarse voice raised angrily; and </p><p>soon afterwards Rowan blustered in. Rentland </p><p>could no longer overhear the voices. He went back </p><p>to his own private office and called the station </p><p>master at the Grand Central Station on the tele- </p><p>phone. </p><p> “the seven o’clock train from Chicago ?” the clerk</p><p>asked in a guarded voice. </p><p>“It came in at 10:30, as </p><p>expected? Oh, at 10:10! </p><p>Thank you.” He hung up </p><p>the receiver and opened </p><p>the door to pass a word </p><p>with Rowan as he came </p><p>out of the president’s </p><p>office. </p><p> “They've wired that the</p><p>Elizabethan Age couldn’t </p><p>get beyond Boston, Ro- </p><p>wan,” he cried curiously. </p><p>“The--- </p><p>hooker!” The dock super- </p><p>intendent had gone strangely white; for the im- </p><p>perceptible fraction of an instant his eyes dimmed </p><p>with fear, as he stared into the wondering face of </p><p>the clerk, but he recovered himself quickly, spat </p><p>offensively, and slammed the door as he went out. </p><p>Rentland stood with clenching hands for a moment; </p><p>then he glanced at the clock and hurried to the en- </p><p>trance of the outer office. The elevator was just </p><p>bringing up from the street a red-haired, blue-gray- </p><p>eyed young man of medium height, who, noting with </p><p>a quick, intelligent glance the arrangement of the </p><p>offices, advanced directly toward President Welter’s </p><p>door. The chief clerk stepped forward quickly. </p><p> “You are Mr. Trant?”</p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “I am Rentland. This way, please.” He led the</p><p>psychologist to the little room behind the files, </p><p>where he had telephoned the moment before. </p><p>“Your wire to me in Chicago, which brought me </p><p>here,” said Trant, turning from the inscription </p><p>“Chief Clerk” on the door to the dogged, decisive </p><p>features and wiry form of his client, “gave me to </p><p>understand that you wished to have me investigate </p><p>the disappearance, or death, of two of your dock </p><p>scaQe-checkers. I suppose you were acting for </p><p>President Welter—of whom I have heard—in send- </p><p>ing for me?” </p><p> “No,” said Rentland, as he waved Trant to a</p><p>seat. “President Welter is certainly not troubling </p><p>himself to that extent over an investigation.” </p><p>“Then the company, or some other officer?” Trant </p><p>questioned, with increasing curiosity. </p><p> “No; nor the company, nor any other officer in it,</p><p>Mr. Trant.” Rentland smiled. “Nor even am I, </p><p>as chief clerk of the American Commodities Com- </p><p>pany, overtroubling myself about those checkers," </p><p>he leaned nearer to Trant, confidentially, “but as a </p><p>special agent for the United States Treasury De- </p><p>partment I am extremely interested in the death of </p><p>one of these men, and in the disappearance of the </p><p>other. And fcr that I called you to help me.” </p><p> “As a secret agent for the Government?” Trant</p><p>repeated, with rapidly rising interest.</p><p> “Yes; a spy, if you wish so to call me, but as</p><p>truly in the ranks of the enemies to my country as </p><p>any Nathan Hale, who has a statue in this city. </p><p>To-day the enemies are the big, corrupting, thiev- </p><p>ing corporations like this company; and appreciat- </p><p>ing that, I am not ashamed to be a spy in their </p><p>ranks, commissioned by the Government to catch </p><p>and condemn President Welter, and any other offi- </p><p>cers involved with him, for systematically stealing </p><p>from the Government for </p><p>the past ten years, and for </p><p>probable connivance in the </p><p>murder of at least one of </p><p>those two checkers so that </p><p>the company might con- </p><p>tinue to steal.” </p><p> “To steal? How?”</p><p>“Customs frauds, thefts, </p><p>smuggling—anything you </p><p>wish to call it. Exactly </p><p>what or how, I can’t tell; </p><p>for that is part of what </p><p>I sent for you to find </p><p>out For a number of </p><p>years the Customs Department has suspected, </p><p>upon circumstantial evidence, that the enormous </p><p>profits of this company upon the thousand and </p><p>one things which it is importing and distributing </p><p>must come in part from goods they have got </p><p>through without paying the proper duty. So at </p><p>my own suggestion I entered the employ of the </p><p>company a year ago to get track of the method. </p><p>But after a year here I was almost ready to give </p><p>up the investigation in despair, when Ed.

To me it looked suspiciously like murder. </p><p>Within two weeks Morse, who was appointed as </p><p>checker in his place, suddenly disappeared. The </p><p>company’s officials showed no concern as to the fate </p><p>of these two men; and my suspicions that some- </p><p>thing crooked might be going on at scale house No. </p><p>3 were strengthened; and I sent for you to help me </p><p>to get at the bottom of things.” </p><p> “Is it not best then to begin by giving me as</p><p>fully as possible the details of the employment of </p><p>Morse and Landers, and also of their disappear- </p><p>ance?" the young psychologist suggested. </p><p> “I have told you these things here, Trant, rather</p><p>than take you to some safer place," the secret agent </p><p>replied, “because I have been waiting for some one </p><p>who can tell you what you need to know better than </p><p>I can. Edith Rowan, the stepdaughter of the dock </p><p>superintendent, knew Landers well, for he boarded </p><p>at Rowan’s house. She was—or is, if he still lives </p><p>—engaged to Morse. It is an unusual thing for </p><p>Rowan himself to come here to see President Wel- </p><p>ter, as he did just before you came; but every morn- </p><p>ing since Morse disappeared his daughter has come </p><p>to see Welter personally. She is already waiting in </p><p>the outer office.” Opening the door, he indicated </p><p>to Trant a light-haired, overdressed, nervous girl </p><p>twisting about uneasily on the seat outside the </p><p>president’s private office. </p><p> “Welter thinks it policy, for some reason, to see</p><p>her a moment every morning. But she always </p><p>comes out almost at once—crying.” </p><p> “This is interesting,” Trant commented, as he</p><p>watched the girl go into the president’s office. After </p><p>only a moment she came out, crying. Rentland had </p><p>already left his room, so it seemed by chance that </p><p>he and Trant met and supported her to the elevator, </p><p>and over the slippery pavement to a neat electric </p><p>coup6 which was standing at the curb. </p><p> “It’s hers,” said Rentland, as Trant hesitated be-</p><p>fore helping the girl into it. “It’s one of the things </p><p>I wanted you to see. Broadway is very slippery, </p><p>Miss Rowan. You will let me see you home again </p><p>this morning? This gentleman is Mr. Trant, a pri- </p><p>vate detective. I want him to come along with </p><p>us.” </p><p> The girl acquiesced, and Trant crowded into the</p><p>little automobile. Rentland turned the coupe skill- </p><p>fully out into the swept path of the street, ran </p><p>swiftly down Fifth Avenue to Fourteenth Street,</p><p>and stopped three streets to the east before a house </p><p>in the middle of the block. The house was as nar- </p><p>row and cramped and as cheaply constructed as its </p><p>neighbors on both sides. It had lace curtains con- </p><p>spicuous in every window, and with impressive </p><p>statuettes, vases, and gaudy bits of bric-a-brac in </p><p>the front rooms. </p><p> “He told me again that Will must still be off</p><p>drunk; and Will never takes a drink,” she spoke to </p><p>them for the first time, as they entered the little </p><p>sitting room. </p><p> “‘He’ is Welter,” Rentland explained to Trant.</p><p>“ ‘Will’ is Morse, the missing man. Now, Miss </p><p>Rowan, I have brought Mr.#Trant with me because </p><p>I have asked him to help me find Morse for you, as </p><p>I promised; and I want you to tell him everything </p><p>you can about how Landers was killed and how </p><p>Morse disappeared.” </p><p> “And remember,” Trant interposed, “that I know</p><p>very little about the American Commodities Com- </p><p>pany.” </p><p> “Why, Mr. Trant,” the girl gathered herself to-</p><p>gether, “you cannot help knowing something about </p><p>the company! It imports almost everything— </p><p>tobacco, sugar, coffee, olives, and preserved fruits, </p><p>oils, and all sorts of table delicacies, from all over </p><p>the world, even from Borneo, Mr. Trant, and from </p><p>Madagascar and New Zealand. It has big ware- </p><p>houses at the docks with millions of dollars’ worth </p><p>of goods stored in them. My stepfather has been </p><p>with the company for years, and has charge of all </p><p>that goes on at the docks.” </p><p> “Including the weighing?”</p><p> “Yes; everything on which there is a duty when</p><p>it is taken off the boats has to be weighed, and to </p><p>do this there are big scales, and for each one a scale </p><p>house. When a scale is being used there are two </p><p>men in the scale house. One of these is the Govern- </p><p>ment weigher, who sets the scale to a balance and </p><p>notes down the weight in a book. The other man, </p><p>who is an employee of the company, writes the </p><p>weight also in a book of his own; and he is called </p><p>the company’s checker. But though there are half </p><p>a dozen scales, almost everything, when it is pos- </p><p>sible, is unloaded in front of Scale No. 3, for that </p><p>is the best berth for ships.” </p><p> “And Landers?”</p><p> “Landers was the company’s checker on scale No.</p><p>3. Well, about five weeks ago I began to see that</p><p>Mr. Landers was troubled about something. Twice </p><p>a queer, quiet little man with a scar on his cheek </p><p>came to see him, and each time they went up to Mr. </p><p>Landers’ room and talked a long while. Ed’s room </p><p>was over the sitting room, and after the man had </p><p>gone I could hear him walking back and forth— </p><p>walking and walking until it seemed as though he </p><p>would never stop. I told father about this man </p><p>who troubled Mr. Landers, and he asked him about </p><p>it, but Mr. Landers flew into a rage and said it was </p><p>nothing of importance. Then one night—it was a </p><p>Wednesday—everybody stayed late at the docks </p><p>to finish unloading the steamer Covallo. About two </p><p>o’clock father got home, but Mr. Landers had not </p><p>been ready to come with him. He did not come all </p><p>that night, and the next day he did not come home. </p><p> “Now, Mr. Trant, they are very careful at the</p><p>warehouses about who goes in and out, because so </p><p>many valuable things are stored there. On one side </p><p>the warehouses open on the docks, and at each end </p><p>they are fenced off so that you cannot go along the </p><p>docks and get away from them that way; and on the </p><p>other side they open on the street through great </p><p>driveway doors, and at every door, as long as it </p><p>is open, there stands a watchman, who sees every- </p><p>body that goes in and out. Only one door was open </p><p>that Wednesday night, and the watchman there had </p><p>not seen Mr. Landers go out. And the second night </p><p>passed, and he did not come home. But the next </p><p>morning, Friday morning,” the girl caught her </p><p>breath hysterically, “Mr. Landers’ body was found </p><p>in the engine room back of scale house No. 3, with </p><p>the face crushed in horribly!” </p><p> “Was the engine room occupied?” said Trant,</p><p>quickly. “It must have been occupied in the day- </p><p>time, and probably on the night when Landers dis- </p><p>appeared, as they were unloading the Cavdlo, But </p><p>THE MAN HIGHER UP </p><p>795 </p><p>on the night after which the body was found—was </p><p>it occupied that night ?” </p><p> “I don’t know, Mr. Trant. I think it could not</p><p>have been, for after the verdict of the coroner’s </p><p>jury, which was that Mr. Landers had been killed </p><p>by some part of the machinery, it was said that </p><p>the accident must have happened either the eve- </p><p>ning before, just bfore the engineer shut off his </p><p>engines, or the first thing that morning, just after </p><p>he had started them; for otherwise somebody in the </p><p>engine room would have seen it.” </p><p> “But where had Landers been all day Thursday,</p><p>Miss Rowan, from two o’clock on the second night </p><p>before, when your father last saw him, until the </p><p>accident in the engine room?” </p><p> “It was supposed he had been drunk. When his</p><p>body was found, his clothes were covered with </p><p>fibers from the coffee-sacking, and the jury sup- </p><p>posed he had been sleeping off his liquor in the </p><p>coffee warehouse during Thursday. But I had </p><p>known Ed Landers for almost three years, and in </p><p>all that time I never knew him to take even one </p><p>drink.” </p><p> “Then it was a very unlikely supposition. You</p><p>do not believe in that accident, Miss Rowan ?” Trant </p><p>said, brusquely. </p><p> The girl grew white as paper. “Oh, Mr. Trant,</p><p>I don’t know! I did believe in it. But since Will </p><p>—Mi\ Morse—has disappeared in exactly the same </p><p>way, under exactly the same circumstances, and </p><p>everyone acts about it exactly the same way-” </p><p> “You say the circumstances of Morse’s disap-</p><p>pearance were the same?” Trant pressed quietly </p><p>when she was able to proceed. </p><p> “After Mr. Landers had been found dead,” said</p><p>the girl, pulling herself together again, “Mr. Morse, </p><p>who had been checker in one of the other scale </p><p>houses, was made checker on scale No. 3. We were </p><p>surprised at that, for it was a sort of promotion, and </p><p>father did not like Will; he had been greatly dis- </p><p>pleased at our engagement. Will’s promotion made </p><p>us very happy, for it seemed as though father must </p><p>be changing his opinion. But after Will had been </p><p>checker on scale No. 3 only a few days, the same </p><p>queer, quiet little man with the scar on his cheek </p><p>who had begun coming to see Mr. Landers before </p><p>he was killed began coming to see Will, too! And </p><p>after he began coming, Will was troubled, terribly</p><p>troubled, I could see; but he would not tell me the </p><p>reason. And he expected, after that man began </p><p>coming, that something would happen to him. And </p><p>I know, from the way he acted and spoke about Mr. </p><p>Landers, that he thought he had not been accident- </p><p>ally killed. One evening, when I could see he had </p><p>been more troubled than ever before, he said that </p><p>if anything happened to him I was to go at once to </p><p>his boarding house and take charge of everything in </p><p>his room, and not to let anyone into the room to </p><p>search it until I had removed everything in the </p><p>bureau drawers; everything no matter how </p><p>useless anything seemed. Then, the very next </p><p>night, five days ago, just as while Mr. Landers was </p><p>checker, everybody stayed overtime at the docks to </p><p>finish unloading a vessel, the Elizabethan Age. And </p><p>in the morning Will’s landlady called me on the </p><p>phone to tell me that he.had not come home. Five </p><p>days ago, Mr. Trant! And since then no one has </p><p>seen or heard from him; and the watchman did not </p><p>see him come out of the warehouse that night just </p><p>as he did not see Ed Landers.” </p><p> “What did you find in Morse’s bureau?” asked</p><p>Trant. </p><p> “I found nothing.”</p><p> “Nothing?” Trant repeated. “That is impos-</p><p>sible, Miss Rowan! Think again! Remember he </p><p>warned you that what you found might seem trivial </p><p>and useless.” </p><p> The girl, a little defiantly, studied for an instant</p><p>Trant’s clear-cut features. Suddenly she arose and </p><p>ran from the room, but returned quickly with a </p><p>strange little implement in her hand. </p><p> It was merely a bit of wire, straight for perhaps</p><p>three inches, and then bent in a half circle of five </p><p>or six inches, the bent portion of the wire being </p><p>wound carefully with stout twine, thus: </p><p>The mysterious string-wrapped piece of bent wire. </p><p> “Except for his clothes and some blank writing</p><p>paper and envelopes that was absolutely the only </p><p>thing in the bureau. It was the only thing at all </p><p>in the only locked drawer.” </p><p> Trant and Rentland stared disappointedly at this</p><p>strange implement, which the girl handed to the </p><p>psychologist. </p><p> “You have shown this to your stepfather, Miss</p><p>Rowan, for a possible explanation of why a com- </p><p>pany checker should be so solicitous about such a</p><p>thing as this?” asked Trant. </p><p> “No,” the girl hesitated. “Will had told me not</p><p>to say anything; and I told you father did not like </p><p>Will. He had made up his mind that I was to </p><p>marry Ed Landers. In most ways father is kind </p><p>and generous. He’s kept the coupe we came here in </p><p>for mother and me for two years; and you see,” </p><p>she gestured a little proudly about the bedecked and </p><p>badly furnished rooms, “you see how he gets every- </p><p>thing for us. Mr. Landers was most generous, too. </p><p>He took me to the theaters two or three times every </p><p>week—always the best seats, too. I didn’t want to </p><p>go, but father made me. I preferred Will, though </p><p>he wasn’t so generous.” </p><p> Trant’s eyes returned, with more intelligent scru-</p><p>tiny, to the mysterious implement in his hand. </p><p> “What salary do checkers receive, Rentland?” he</p><p>asked, in a low tone. </p><p> “One hundred and twenty-five dollars a month.”</p><p>“And her father, the dock superintendent—how </p><p>much?” Trant’s expressive glance now jumping </p><p>about from one gaudy, extravagant trifle in the </p><p>room to another, caught a glimpse again of the elec- </p><p>tric coupe standing in the street, then returned to </p><p>the tiny bit of wire in his hand. </p><p> “Three thousand a year,” Rentland replied.</p><p> “Tell me, Miss Rowan,” said Trant, “this imple-</p><p>ment—have you by any chance mentioned it to </p><p>President Welter?” </p><p> “Why, no, Mr. Trant.”</p><p> “You are sure of that? Excellent! Excellent!</p><p>Now the queer, quiet little man with the scar on his </p><p>cheek who came to see Morse; no one could tell you </p><p>anything about him?” </p><p>796 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> “No one, Mr. Trant; but yesterday Will’s land-</p><p>lady told me that a man has come to ask for Will </p><p>every forenoon since he disappeared, and she thinks </p><p>this may be the man with the scar, though she </p><p>can’t be sure, for he kept the collar of his overcoat </p><p>up about his face. She was to telephone me if he </p><p>came again.” </p><p> “If he comes this morning,” Trant glanced</p><p>quickly at his watch, “you and I, Rentland, might </p><p>much better be waiting for him over there.” </p><p> The psychologist rose, putting the bent, twine-</p><p>wound bit of wire carefully into his pocket; and a </p><p>minute later the two men crossed the street to the </p><p>house, already known to Rentland, where Morse had </p><p>boarded. The landlady not only allowed them to </p><p>wait in her little parlor, but waited with them un- </p><p>til at the end of an hour she pointed with an eager </p><p>gesture to a short man in a big ulster who turned </p><p>sharply up the front steps. </p><p> “That's him—see!” she exclaimed.</p><p> “That the man with the scarl” cried Rentland.</p><p>“Well! I know him.” </p><p> He made for the door, caught at the ulster and</p><p>pulled the little man into the house by main force. </p><p> “Well, Dickey!” the secret agent challenged, as</p><p>the man faced him in startled recognition. “What </p><p>are you doing in this case? Trant, this i3 Inspec- </p><p>tor Dickey, of the Customs Office,” he introduced </p><p>the officer. </p><p>“I’m in the case on my own hook, if I know what </p><p>case you’re talking about,” piped Dickey. “Morse, </p><p>eh? and the American Commodities Company, eh?” </p><p>“Exactly,” said Rentland, brusquely. “What were </p><p>you calling to see Landers for?” </p><p> “You know about that?” The little man looked</p><p>up sharply. “Well, six weeks ago Landers came </p><p>to me and told me he had something to sell; a secret </p><p>system for beating the customs. But before we got </p><p>to terms, he began losing his nerve a little; he got </p><p>it back, however, and was going to tell me when, all </p><p>at once, he disappeared, and two days later he was </p><p>dead! That made it hotter for me; so I went after </p><p>Morse. But Morse denied he knew anything. Then </p><p>Morse disappeared, too.” </p><p> “So you got nothing at all out of them?” Rent-</p><p>land interposed.</p><p> “Nothing I could use. Landers, one time when he</p><p>was getting up his nerve, showed me a piece of bent </p><p>wire—with string around it—in his room, and be- </p><p>gan telling me something when Rowan called him, </p><p>and then he shut up.” </p><p> “A bent wire!” Trant cried, eagerly. “lake this?”</p><p>He took from his pocket the implement given him </p><p>by Edith Rowan. “Morse had this in his room, the </p><p>only thing in a locked drawer.” </p><p> “The same thing!” Dickey cried, seizing it. “So</p><p>Morse had it, too, after he became checker at scale </p><p>No. 3, where the cheating is, if anywhere. The </p><p>very thing Landers started to explain to me, and </p><p>how they cheated the customs with it. I say, we </p><p>must have it now, Rentland! We need only go </p><p>to the docks and watch them while they weigh, and </p><p>see how they use it, and arrest them and then we </p><p>have them at last, eh, old man?” he cried in triumph. </p><p>“We have them at last!” </p><p> “You mean,” Trant cut in upon the customs man,</p><p>"that you can convict and jail perhaps the checker, </p><p>or a foreman, or maybe even a dock superintendent </p><p>—as usual. But the men higher up—the big men </p><p>who are really at the bottom of this business and </p><p>the only ones worth getting—will you catch them ?” </p><p> "We must take those we can get,” said Dickey</p><p>sharply. </p><p> Trant laid his hand on the little officer’s arm.</p><p> “I am a stranger to you,” he said, “but if you</p><p>have followed some of the latest criminal cases in </p><p>Illinois perhaps you know that, using the methods </p><p>of modern practical psychology, I have been able to </p><p>get results where old way3 have failed. We are </p><p>front to front now with perhaps the greatest prob- </p><p>lem of modern criminal catching, to catch, in cases </p><p>involving a great corporation, not only the little </p><p>men low down who perform the criminal acts, but </p><p>the men higher up, who conceive, or connive at the </p><p>criminal scheme. Rentland, I did not come here to </p><p>convict merely a dock foreman; but if we are </p><p>going to reach anyone higher than that, you must </p><p>not let Inspector Dickey excite suspicion by prying </p><p>into matters at the docks this afternoon!” </p><p> “But what else can we do?” said Rentland, doubt-</p><p>fully. </p><p> “Modern practical psychology gives a dozen pos-</p><p>sible ways for proving the knowledge of the man </p><p>higher up in this corporation crime,” Trant an-</p><p>swered, “and I am considering which is the most </p><p>practicable. Only tell me,” he demanded suddenly; </p><p>“Mr. Welter I have heard is one of the rich men of </p><p>New York who make it a fad to give largely to </p><p>universities and other institutions; can you tell </p><p>me with what ones he may be most closely in- </p><p>terested?” </p><p> “I have heard,” Rentland replied, “that he is one</p><p>of the patrons of the Stuyvesant School of Science. </p><p>It i3 probably the most fashionably patroned insti- </p><p>tution in New York; and Welter’s name, I know, </p><p>figures with it in the newspapers.” </p><p> “Nothing could be better!” Trant exclaimed.</p><p>“Kuno Schmalz has his psychological laboratory </p><p>there. I see my way now, Rentland; and you will </p><p>hear from me early in the afternoon. But keep </p><p>away from the docks!” He turned and left the </p><p>astonished customs officers abruptly. Half an hour </p><p>later the young psychologist sent in his card to Pro- </p><p>fessor Schmalz in the laboratory of the Stuyvesant </p><p>School of Science. The German, broad-faced, spec- </p><p>tacled, beaming, himself came to the laboratory </p><p>door. </p><p> “Is it Mr. Trant—the young, apt pupil of my old</p><p>friend, Dr. Reiland ?” he boomed, admiringly. “Ach! </p><p>luck is good to Reiland! For twenty years I, too, </p><p>have shown them in the laboratory how fear, guilt, </p><p>every emotion causes in the body reactions which </p><p>can be measured But do they apply it? Pouf! </p><p>No! it remains to them all impractical, academic, </p><p>because I have only nincompoops in my classes!” </p><p> “Professor Schmalz,” said Trant, following him</p><p>into the laboratory, and glancing from one to </p><p>another of the delicate instruments with keen in- </p><p>terest, “tell me along what line you are now </p><p>working.” </p><p> “Ach! I have been for a year now experimenting</p><p>with the plethysmograph and the pneumograph. I </p><p>make a taste, I make a smell, or I make a noise to </p><p>excite feeling in the subject; and I read by the </p><p>plethysmograph that the volume of blood in the </p><p>hand decreases under the emotions and that the </p><p>THE MAN HIGHER UP </p><p>797 </p><p>pulse quickens; and by the pneumograph I read that </p><p>the breathing is easier or quicker, depending on </p><p>whether the emotions are pleasant or unpleasant. I </p><p>have performed this year more than two thousand </p><p>of those experiments.” </p><p> “Good! I have a problem in which you can be of</p><p>the very greatest use to me; and the plethysmo- </p><p>graph and the pneumograph will serve my purpose </p><p>as well as any other instruments in the laboratory. </p><p>For no matter how hardened a man may be, no </p><p>matter how impossible it may have become to de- </p><p>tect his feelings in his face or bearing, he cannot </p><p>prevent the volume of blood in his hand from de- </p><p>creasing, and his breathing from becoming dif- </p><p>ferent, under the influence of emotions of fear or </p><p>guilt. By the way, professor, is Mr. Welter familiar </p><p>with these experiments of yours?” </p><p> “What, he!” cried the stout German. “For why</p><p>should I tell him about them? He knows nothing. </p><p>He has bought my time to instruct classes; he has </p><p>not bought, py chiminey! everything—even the soul </p><p>Gott gave me!” </p><p> “But he would be interested in them?”</p><p> “To be sure, he would be interested in them! He</p><p>would bring in his automobile three or four other </p><p>fat money-makers, and he would show off before </p><p>them. He would make his trained bear—that is me </p><p>—dan'ie!” </p><p> “Good!” cried Trant again, excitedly. “Professor</p><p>Schmalz, would you be willing to give a little exhi- </p><p>bition of the plethysmograph and pneumograph, thi3 </p><p>evening, if possible, and arrange for President Wel- </p><p>ter to attend it?” </p><p> The astute German cast on him a quick glance</p><p>of interrogation. “Why not?” he said. “It makes </p><p>nothing to me what purpose you will be carrying </p><p>out; no, py chiminey! not if it costs me my posi- </p><p>tion of trained bear; because I have confidence in </p><p>my psychology that it will not make any innocent </p><p>man suffer!” </p><p> “And you will have two or three scientists present</p><p>to watch the experiments? And you will allow mo </p><p>to be there also and assist?” </p><p> “With great pleasure.”</p><p> “But, Professor Schmalz, you need not intro-</p><p>duce me to Mr. Welter, who will think I am one</p><p>of your assistants.” </p><p> “As you wish about that, pupil of my dear old</p><p>friend.” </p><p> “Excellent!” Trant leaped to his feet. “Pro-</p><p>vided it is possible to arrange this with Mr. Welter, </p><p>how soon can you let me know?” </p><p> “Ach! it is as good as arranged, I tell you. His</p><p>vanity will arrange it if I assure the greatest </p><p>publicity-” </p><p> "The more publicity the better.”</p><p>“Wait! It shall be fixed before you leave here.” </p><p>The professor led the way into his private study, </p><p>telephoned to the president of the American Com- </p><p>modities Company, and made the appointment with- </p><p>out trouble. </p><p> A few minutes before eight o’clock that evening</p><p>Trant again mounted rapidly the stone steps to the </p><p>professor’s laboratory. The professor and two </p><p>others, who were bending over a table in the cen- </p><p>ter of the room, turned at his entrance. President </p><p>Welter had not yet arrived. The young psycholo- </p><p>gist acknowledged with pleasure the introduction to </p><p>the two scientists with Schmalz. Both of them were </p><p>known to him by name, and he had been following </p><p>with interest a series of experiments, whieh the </p><p>elder, Dr. Annerly, had been reporting in a psycho- </p><p>logical journal. Then he turned at once to the </p><p>apparatus on the table. </p><p> He was still examining the instruments when the</p><p>noise of a motor car stopping at the door warned </p><p>him of the arrival of President Welter's party. </p><p>Then the laboratory door opened and the party </p><p>appeared. They also were three in number; stout </p><p>men, rather obtrusively dressed, in jovial spirits, </p><p>with strong faces flushed now with the wine they </p><p>had taken at dinner. </p><p> "Well, professor, what fireworks are you going</p><p>to show us to-night?” asked Welter, patronizingly. </p><p>"Schmalz,” he explained to his companions, “is the </p><p>chief ringmaster of this circus.” </p><p> The bearded face of the German grew purple un-</p><p>der Welter’s jokingly overbearing manner; but he </p><p>turned to the instruments and began to explain </p><p>them. The pneumograph, which the professor first </p><p>took up, consists of a very thin flexible brass plate </p><p>suspended by a cord around the neck of the person </p><p>under examination, and fastened tightly against</p><p>the chest by a cord circling the body. On the outer </p><p>surface of this plate are two small, bent levers, </p><p>connected at one end to the cord around the body of </p><p>the subject, and at the other end to the surface </p><p>of a small hollow drum fastened to the plate be- </p><p>tween the two. As the chest rises and falls in </p><p>breathing, the levers press more and less upon the </p><p>surface of the drum; and this varying pressure </p><p>on the air inside the drum is transmitted from the </p><p>drum through an air-tight tube to a little pencil </p><p>which it lowers and raises. The pencil, as it rises </p><p>and falls, touching always a sheet of smoked paper </p><p>traveling over a cylinder on the recording device, </p><p>traces a line whose rising strokes represent accu- </p><p>rately the drawing of air into the chest and whose </p><p>falling represents its expulsion. </p><p> It was clear to Trant that the professor’s rapid</p><p>explanation, though plain enough to the psycholo- </p><p>gists already familiar with the device, was only </p><p>partly understood by the big men. It had not been </p><p>explained to them that changes in the breathing so </p><p>slight as to be imperceptible to the eye would be </p><p>recorded unmistakably by the moving pencil. </p><p> Professor Schmalz turned to the second instru-</p><p>ment. This was a plethysmograph, designed to </p><p>measure the increase or decrease of the size of one </p><p>finger of a person under examination as the blood </p><p>supply to that finger becomes greater or less. It con- </p><p>sists primarily of a small cylinder so constructed </p><p>that it can be fitted over the finger and made air- </p><p>tight. Increase or decrease of the size of the finger </p><p>then increases or decreases the air pressure inside </p><p>the cylinder. These changes in the air pressure are </p><p>transmitted through an airtight tube to a delicate </p><p>piston which moves a pencil and makes a line upon </p><p>the record sheet just under that made by the </p><p>pneumograph. The upward or downward trend of </p><p>this line shows the increase or decrease of the blood </p><p>supply, while the smaller vibrations up and down </p><p>record the pulse beat in the finger. </p><p> There is still a third'pencil touching tha record</p><p>798 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>sheet above the other two and wired electrically to </p><p>a key like that of a telegraph instrument fastened </p><p>to the table. When this key is in its normal position </p><p>this pencil makes simply a straight line upon the </p><p>sheet; but instantly when the key is pressed down, </p><p>the line breaks downward also. </p><p> This third instrument is used merely to record</p><p>on the sheet, by the change in the line, the point at </p><p>which the object that arouses sensation or emotion </p><p>is displayed to the person undergoing examination. </p><p> The instant’s silence which followed Schmalz’s</p><p>rapid explanation was broken by one of Welter’s </p><p>companions with the query: </p><p> “Well, what’s the use of all this stuff, any way?”</p><p>“Ach!” said Schmalz, bluntly, “it is interesting, </p><p>curious! I will show you.” </p><p> “Will one of you gentlemen,” said Trant, quickly,</p><p>“permit us to make use of him in the demonstra- </p><p>tion?” </p><p> “Try it, Jim,” Welter laughed, noisily.</p><p> “Not I,” said the other. “This is your circus.”</p><p>“Yes, indeed it’s mine. And I’m not afraid of it. </p><p>Schmalz, do your worst!” He dropped, laughing, </p><p>into the chair the professor set for him, and at </p><p>Schmalz’s direction unbuttoned his vest. The pro- </p><p>fessor hung the pneumograph around his neck and </p><p>fastened it tightly about the big chest. He laid Wel- </p><p>ter’s forearm in a rest suspended from the ceiling, </p><p>and attached the cylinder to the second finger of the </p><p>plump hand. In the meantime Trant had quickly </p><p>set the pencils to bear upon the record sheet and </p><p>had started the cylinder on which the sheet traveled </p><p>under them. </p><p> “You see, I have prepared for you.” Schmalz</p><p>lifted a napkin from a tray holding several little </p><p>dishes. He took from one of these a bit of caviar </p><p>and‘laid it upon Welter’s tongue. At the same in- </p><p>stant Trant pushed down the key. The pencils </p><p>showed a slight commotion, and the spectators </p><p>stared at this record sheet! </p><p> “Ach!” exclaimed Schmalz, “you do not like</p><p>caviar.” </p><p>“How do you know that?” demanded Welter. </p><p>“The instruments show that at the unpleasant </p><p>taste you breathe less freely—not so deep. Your </p><p>finger, as under strong sensation or emotions, grows</p><p>smaller, and your pulse beats more rapidly.” </p><p> “By the Lord! Welter, what do you think of</p><p>that?” cried one of his companions; “Your finger </p><p>gets smaller when you taste caviar!” </p><p> It was a joke to them. Boisterously laughing,</p><p>they tried Welter with other food upon the tray; </p><p>they lighted for him one of the black cigars of </p><p>which he was most fond, and watched the trembling </p><p>pencils write the record of his pleasure at the taste </p><p>and smell. Through it all Trant waited, alert, </p><p>watchful, biding the time to carry out his plan. It </p><p>came when, having exhausted the articles at hand, </p><p>they paused to find some other means to carry on </p><p>the amusement. The young psychologist leaned for- </p><p>ward suddenly. </p><p> “It is no great ordeal after all, is it, Mr. Welter?”</p><p>he said. “Modern psychology does not put its sub- </p><p>jects to torture like”—he halted, meaningly — “a </p><p>prisoner in the Elizabethan Age!” </p><p> Dr. Annerly, bending over the record sheet,</p><p>uttered a startled exclamation. Trant, glancing </p><p>keenly at him, straightened triumphantly. But the </p><p>young psychologist did not pause. He took quickly </p><p>from his pocket a photograph, showing merely a </p><p>heap of empty coffee sacks piled carelessly to a </p><p>height of some two feet along the inner wall of a </p><p>shed, and laid it in front of the subject. Welter’s </p><p>face did not alter; but again the pencils shuddered </p><p>over the moving paper, and the watchers stared </p><p>with astonishment. Rapidly removing the photo- </p><p>graph, Trant substituted for it the bent wire given </p><p>him by Miss Rowan. Then for the last time he </p><p>swung to the instrument, and as his eyes caught </p><p>the wildly vibrating pencils, they flared with </p><p>triumph. </p><p> President Welter rose abruptly, but not too hur-</p><p>riedly. “That’s about enough of this tomfoolery,” </p><p>he said, with perfect self-possession. </p><p> His jaw had imperceptibly squared to the watch-</p><p>ful determination of the prize fighter driven into his </p><p>corner. His cheek still held the ruddy glow of </p><p>health; but the wine flush had disappeared from it, </p><p>and he was perfectly sober. </p><p> Trant tore the strip of paper from the instrument,</p><p>and numbered the last three reactions 1, 2, 3. This </p><p>is the way the records looked: </p><p>/YVVVvvmmYv\/y\ </p><p>^Record of the reaction when Trant said: "A_ </p><p>'' prisoner in the Elizabethan Age I ” ^</p><p>fRc$ord vtade nihen Welter saw the photograph of </p><p>' a heap of cojjee sacks. </p><p> “Amazing!” said Dr. Annerly. “Mr. Welter, I</p><p>am curious to know what associations you have with </p><p>that photograph and bent wire, the sight of which </p><p>aroused in you such strong emotion.” </p><p> By immense self-control, the president of the</p><p>" THE MAN HIGHER UP </p><p>799 </p><p>American Commodities Company met his eyes </p><p>fairly. “None,” he answered. </p><p> “Impossible! No psychologist, knowing how this</p><p>record was taken, could look at it without feeling </p><p>absolutely certain that the photograph and spring </p><p>caused in you such excessive emotion that I am </p><p>tempted to give it, without further words, the name </p><p>of ‘intense fright!’ But if we have inadvertently </p><p>surprised a secret, we have no desire to pry into it </p><p>further. Is it not so, Mr. Trant?” </p><p> At the name President Welter whirled suddenly.</p><p>“Trant! Is your name Trant?” he demanded. </p><p>“Well, I've heard of you.” His eyes hardened. “A </p><p>man like you goes just so far, and then—somebody </p><p>stops him!” </p><p> “As they stopped Landers?” Trant inquired.</p><p>“Come, we’ve seen enough, I guess,” said Presi- </p><p>dent Welter, and, including for one instant in his </p><p>now frankly menacing gaze both Trant and Profes- </p><p>sor Schmalz, turned to the door, closely followed by </p><p>his companions. And a moment later the quick ex- </p><p>plosions of his automobile were heard. At the </p><p>sound, Trant seized suddenly a large envelope, </p><p>dropped into it the photograph and wire he had </p><p>just used, sealed, signed, and dated it, signed and </p><p>dated also the record from the instruments, and </p><p>hurriedly handed all to Dr. Annerly. </p><p> “Doctor, I trust this to you,” he cried, excitedly.</p><p>"It will be best to have them attested by all three </p><p>of you. If possible get the record photographed </p><p>to-night, and distribute the photographs in safe </p><p>places. Above all, do not let the record itself out </p><p>of your hands until I come for it. It is important </p><p>—extremely important! As for me, I have not a </p><p>moment to lose!” </p><p> He seized his hat and dashed from the room,</p><p>leaving them in an astonished group. </p><p> The young psychologist sped down the stone</p><p>steps of the laboratory three at a time, ran at top </p><p>speed to the nearest street corner, turned it and </p><p>leaped into a waiting taxicab. “The American Com- </p><p>modities Company’s dock in Brooklyn,” he shouted, </p><p>“and never mind the speed limits!” </p><p> Rentland and the chauffeur, awaiting him in the</p><p>machine, galvanized at his coming. </p><p> "Hot work?” the custom’s agent asked.</p><p> “It may be very hot; but we have the start of</p><p>him,” Trant replied as the car shot ahead. “Welter </p><p>himself is coming to the docks to-night, I think, by </p><p>the look of him! He left just before me, but must </p><p>drop his friends first. He suspects, now, that we </p><p>know; but he cannot be aware that we know that </p><p>they are unloading to-night. He probably counts on </p><p>our waiting to catch them at the cheating to-mor- </p><p>row morning. So he’s going over to-night himself </p><p>if I size him up right, to order it stopped and re- </p><p>move all traces before we can prove anything. Is </p><p>Dickey waiting?” </p><p> “When you give the word he is to take us in and</p><p>catch them at it. If Welter himself comes, as you </p><p>think, it will not change the plan?” Rentland asked. </p><p> “Not at all,” said Trant, “for I have him already.</p><p>He will deny everything, of course, but it’s too late </p><p>now!” </p><p> The big ear, with unchecked speed, swung down</p><p>Broadway, slowed after a twenty-minutes/-run to </p><p>cross the Brooklyn Bridge, and, turning to the left, </p><p>plunged once more at high speed into the nar- </p><p>rower and less well-kept thoroughfares of the </p><p>Brooklyn water front. Two minutes later it over- </p><p>took a little electric coupe, bobbing excitedly down </p><p>the sloping street. As they passed it, Trant caught </p><p>sight of the illuminated number hanging at its rear, </p><p>and shouted suddenly to the chauffeur, who brought </p><p>his car to a stop a hundred feet beyond. The psy- </p><p>chologist, leaping down, ran into the road before </p><p>the little car. </p><p> “Miss Rowan,” he cried to its single occupant, as</p><p>it came to a stop. "Why are you coming over here </p><p>at this time to-night?” </p><p> "Oh, it’s you, Mr. Trant!” She opened the door,</p><p>showing relief in the recognition. “Oh, I’m so </p><p>worried. I’m on my way to see father; for a tele- </p><p>gram just came to him from Boston; mother opened </p><p>it, and told me to take it to him at once, as it was </p><p>most important. She wouldn't tell me what it was </p><p>about, but it excited her a great deal. Oh, I’m so </p><p>afraid it must be about Will and that was why she </p><p>wouldn’t tell me.” </p><p> “From Boston?” Trant pressed quickly. Having</p><p>her confidence, the girl nervously read the tele- </p><p>gram aloud by the light of the coup6’s side lamps, </p><p>it read: </p><p> Police have taken your friend out of our hands;</p><p>look out for trouble. Wilson. </p><p> “Who is Wilson?” Trant demanded.</p><p> “I am not sure it is the man, but the captain of</p><p>the Elizabethan Age is a friend of father’s named </p><p>Wilson!” </p><p> “I can’t help you then, after all,” said Trant,</p><p>springing back to his powerful car. He whispered </p><p>a word to the chauffeur which sent it driving ahead </p><p>through the drifts at double its former speed, leav- </p><p>ing the little electric coupe far behind. Ten minutes </p><p>later Rentland stopped the motor a block short of </p><p>a great lighted doorway which suddenly showed in </p><p>a length of dark, lowering buildings which lay be- </p><p>side the American Commodities Company’s Brook- </p><p>lyn docks. </p><p> “Now,” the secret agent volunteered, “it is up to</p><p>me to find Dickey’s ladder!” </p><p> He guided Trant down a narrow, dark court</p><p>which brought them face to face with a blank wall; </p><p>against this wall a light ladder had been recently </p><p>placed. Ascending it, they came into the dock in- </p><p>closure. Descending again by a dozen rickety, dis- </p><p>used steps, they reached a darker, covered team- </p><p>way and hurried along it to the docks. Just short </p><p>of the end of the open dock houses, where a string </p><p>of arc lamps threw their white and flickering light </p><p>upon the huge, black side of a moored steamer, </p><p>Rentland turned into a little shed, and the two came </p><p>suddenly upon Customs Officer Dickey. </p><p> “This one next to us,” the little man whispered,</p><p>eagerly, to Trant, as he grasped his hand, “is the </p><p>scale house where whatever is being done is dons— </p><p>No. 3.” </p><p> In and out of the yawning gangways of the</p><p>steamer before them struggling lines of sweating </p><p>men were wheeling trucks loaded with bales of to- </p><p>bacco. Trant looked first to the left, where the bales </p><p>disappeared into the tobacco warehouse; then to </p><p>the right, where, close at hand, each truck-load </p><p>800 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>stopped momentarily on a scale platform in front </p><p>of the low shed which bore the number Dickey indi- </p><p>cated in a large white figure. </p><p> “Who's that?” asked Trant as a small figure,</p><p>hardly five feet tall, cadaverous, beetle-browed, with </p><p>cold, malignant, red-lidded eyes passed directly un- </p><p>der the arc light nearest them. </p><p> “Rowan, the dock superintendent!” Dickey whis-</p><p>pered. </p><p> “I knew he was small,” Trent returned with sur-</p><p>prise, “but I thought surely he must have some fist </p><p>to be the terror of these dock laborers.” </p><p> “Wait!” Rentland, behind them, motioned.</p><p> A bloated, menacing figure had suddenly swung</p><p>clear of the group of dock laborers—a roustabout, </p><p>goaded to desperation, with a fist raised against his </p><p>puny superior. But before the blow had fallen an- </p><p>other fist, huge and black, struck the man over </p><p>Rowan’s shoulder with a hammer. He fell, and </p><p>the dock superintendent passed on without a back- </p><p>ward glance, the giant negro who had struck the </p><p>blow following in his footsteps like a dog. </p><p> “The black,” Rentland explained, “is Rowan’s</p><p>bodyguard. He needs him.” </p><p> “I see,” Trant replied. “And for Miss Rowan's</p><p>sake I am glad it was that way,” he added, enig- </p><p>matically. </p><p> Dickey had quietly opened a door on the opposite</p><p>side of the shed; the three slipped quickly through </p><p>it and stepped unobserved around the corner of the </p><p>coffee warehouse to a long, dark, and narrow space. </p><p>On one side of them was the rear wall of scale </p><p>house No. 3, and on the other the engine room </p><p>where Landers’ body had been found. The single </p><p>window in the rear of No. 3 scale house had been </p><p>whitewashed to prevent anyone from looking in </p><p>from that side; but in spots the whitewash had </p><p>fallen off in flakes. Trant put his eye to one of </p><p>these clear spots in the glass and looked in. </p><p> The scale table, supported on heavy posts, ex-</p><p>tended across almost the whole front of the house, </p><p>behind a low, wide window, which permitted those </p><p>seated at the table to see all that occurred on the </p><p>docks. Toward the right end of the table sat the </p><p>Government weigher; toward the left end, and </p><p>separated from him by almost the whole length</p><p>of the table, sat the company checker. They </p><p>were the only persons in the scale house. Trant, </p><p>after his first rapid survey of the scene, fixed his </p><p>eye upon the man who had taken the place which </p><p>Landers had held for three years, and Morse for </p><p>a few days afterwards—the company checker. A </p><p>truck-load of tobacco bales was wheeled on to the </p><p>scales in front of the house. </p><p> “Watch his left knee,” Trant whispered quick-</p><p>ly into Dickey’s ear at the pane beside him, as the </p><p>balance was being made upon the beam before </p><p>them. As he spoke, the Government weigher ad- </p><p>justed the balance and they saw the left leg of the </p><p>company checker pressed hard against the post </p><p>which protected the scale rod at his end. Both </p><p>men in the scale house then read aloud the weight </p><p>and each entered it in the book on the table in front </p><p>of him. A second truckful was wheeled on to the </p><p>scale; and again, just as the Government weigher </p><p>fixed his balances, the company checker, so incon- </p><p>spicuously as to make the act undiscoverable by </p><p>for fh.n.t Tirpr'jsp TTin’f*3. rr,Ti&lt;''l+Pd </p><p>the operation. With the next truck they Saw it </p><p>again. The psychologist turned to the others. </p><p>Rentland, too, had been watching through the pane </p><p>and nodded his satisfaction. </p><p> Immediately Trant dashed open the door of the</p><p>scale house, and threw himself bodily upon the </p><p>checker. The man resisted; they struggled. While </p><p>the customs men protected him, Trant, wrenching </p><p>something from the post beside the checker’s left </p><p>knee, rose with a cry of triumph. Then the psycho- </p><p>logist, warned by a cry from Rentland, leaped </p><p>quickly to one side to avoid a blow from the giant </p><p>negro. His quickness saved him; still the blow, </p><p>glancing along his cheek, hurled him from his feet. </p><p>He rose immediately, blood flowing from a super- </p><p>ficial cut upon his forehead where it had struck the </p><p>scale-house wall. He saw Rentland covering the </p><p>negro with a revolver, and the two other customs </p><p>men arresting, at pistol point, the malignant little </p><p>dock superintendent, the checker, and the others </p><p>who had crowded into the scale house. </p><p> “You see!” Trant exhibited to the customs offi-</p><p>cers a bit of bent wire, wound with string, precisely </p><p>like that the girl had given him that morning and </p><p>he had used in his test of Welter the hour before. </p><p>“It was almost exactly as we knew it must be I This </p><p>spring was stuck through a hole in the protecting </p><p>post so that it prevented the balance beam from ris- </p><p>ing properly when bales were put on the platform. </p><p>A little pressure just at that point takes many </p><p>pounds from each bale weighed. The checker had </p><p>only to move his knee, in a way we would never</p><p>have noticed if we v&amp;re not watching for it, to </p><p>work the scheme by which they have been cheating </p><p>for ten years! But the rest of this affair,’' he </p><p>glanced at the quickly collecting crowd, “can best </p><p>be settled in the office.” </p><p> He led the way, the customs men taking their</p><p>prisoners at pistol point. As they entered the office, </p><p>Rowan first, a girl’s cry and the answering oath of </p><p>her step-father told that the dock superinten- </p><p>dent’s daughter had arrived. But she had been al- </p><p>most overtaken by another powerful car; for be- </p><p>fore Trant could speak with her the outer door of </p><p>the office opened violently and President Welter, in </p><p>an automobile coat and cap, entered. </p><p> “Ah! Mr. Welter, you got here quickly” said</p><p>Trant, meeting calmly his outraged astonishment </p><p>at the scene. “But a little too late.” </p><p> “What is the matter here?” Welter governed</p><p>his voice commandingly. “And what has brought </p><p>you here, from your phrenology?” he demanded, </p><p>contemptuously, of Trant. </p><p> “The hope of catching red-handed, as we have just</p><p>caught them, your company checker and your dock </p><p>superintendent defrauding the Government,’ Trant </p><p>returned, “before you could get here to stop them </p><p>and remove evidences.” </p><p> "What raving idiocy is this?” Welter replied,</p><p>still with excellent moderation. “I came here to </p><p>sign some necessary papers for ships clearing, and </p><p>you-” </p><p>“I say we have caught your men redhanded,” </p><p>Trant repeated, “at the methods used, with your </p><p>certain knowledge and under your direction, Mr. </p><p>Welter, to steal systematically from the United </p><p>OmTemmpTit for—probably the last ten years. </p><p>THE MAN HIGHER UP </p><p>801 </p><p>We have uncovered the means by which your com- </p><p>pany checker at scale No. 3, which, because of its </p><p>position, probably weighs more cargoes than all </p><p>the other scales together, has been lessening the </p><p>apparent weights upon which you pay duties.” </p><p> “Cheating here under my direction?” Welter now</p><p>bellowed indignantly. “What are you talking </p><p>about? Rowan, what is he talking about?” he </p><p>demanded, boldly, of the dock superintendent; but </p><p>the cadaverous little man was unable to brazen it </p><p>out with him. </p><p> “You need not have looked at your docK super-</p><p>intendent just then, Mr. Welter, to see if he would </p><p>stand the racket when the trouble comes, for which </p><p>you have been paying him enough on the side to keep </p><p>him in electric motors and marble statuettes. And </p><p>you cannot try now to disown this crime with the </p><p>regular president-of-corporation excuse, Mr. Wel- </p><p>ter, that you never knew of it, that it was all done </p><p>without your knowledge by a subordinate to make </p><p>a showing in his department; and do not expect, </p><p>either, to escape so easily your certain complicity in </p><p>the murder of Landers, to prevent him from expos- </p><p>ing your scheme and since—even the American </p><p>Commodities Company scarcely dared to have two </p><p>‘accidental deaths’ of checkers in the same month— </p><p>the shanghaiing of Morse later.” </p><p> “My complicity in the death of Landers and the</p><p>disappearance of Morse?” Welter roared. </p><p> “I said the murder of Landers,” Trant corrected.</p><p>“For when Rentland and Dickey tell to-morrow be- </p><p>fore the grand jury how Landers was about to dis- </p><p>close to the Customs Department the secret of the </p><p>cheating in weights; how he was made afraid by </p><p>Rowan, and later was about to tell anyway and was </p><p>prevented only by a most sudden death, I think </p><p>murder will be the word brought in the indictment. </p><p>And I said shanghaiing of Morse, Mr. Welter. When </p><p>we remembered this morning that Morse had dis- </p><p>appeared the night the Elizabethan Age left your </p><p>docks and you and Rowan were so intensely dis- </p><p>gusted at its having had to put into Boston this </p><p>morning instead of going on straight to Sumatra, </p><p>we did not have to wait for the chance information </p><p>this evening that Captain Wilson is a friend of </p><p>Rowan’s to deduce that the missing checker was </p><p>put aboard, as confirmed by the Boston harbor </p><p>police this afternoon, who searched the ship under </p><p>our instructions.” Trant paused a moment; again </p><p>fixed the now trembling Welter with his eye, and </p><p>continued: “I charge your certain complicity in</p><p>these crimes, along with your certain part in the </p><p>customs frauds,” the psychologist repeated. “Un- </p><p>doubtedly, it was Rowan who put Morse out of the </p><p>way upon the Elizabethan Age. Nevertheless, you </p><p>knew that he was a prisoner upon that ship, a fact </p><p>which was written down in indelible black and </p><p>white by my tests of you at the Stuyvesant Institute </p><p>two hours ago, when I merely mentioned to you </p><p>*a prisoner in the Elizabethan Age.' </p><p> “I do not charge that you, personally, were the</p><p>one who murdered Landers; or even that Rowan </p><p>himself did; whether his negro did, as I suspect, </p><p>is a matter now for the courts to decide upon. But </p><p>that you undoubtedly were aware that he was not </p><p>killed accidentally in the engine room, but was </p><p>killed the Wednesday night before and his body hid- </p><p>den under the coffee bags, as I guessed from the </p><p>fibres of coffee sacking on his clothes, was also </p><p>registered as mercilessly by the psychological ma- </p><p>chines when I showed you merely the picture of a </p><p>pile of coffee sacks. </p><p> “And last, Mr. Welter, you deny knowledge of</p><p>the cheating which has been going on, and was at </p><p>the bottom of the other crimes. Well, Welter,” the </p><p>psychologist took from his pocket the bent, twine- </p><p>wound wire, “here is the ‘innocent’ little thing </p><p>which was the third means of causing you to regis- </p><p>ter upon the machines such extreme and inexplicable </p><p>emotion; or rather, Mr. Welter, it is the companion </p><p>piece to that, for this is not the one I showed you, </p><p>the one given to Morse to use, which, however, he </p><p>refused to make use of; but it is the very wire I </p><p>took to-night from the hole in the post where it </p><p>bore against the balance beam-rod to cheat the </p><p>Government. When this is made public to-morrow, </p><p>and with it is made public, too, and attested by the </p><p>scientific men who witnessed them, the diagram </p><p>and explanation of the tests of you two hours ago, </p><p>do you think that you can deny longer that this was </p><p>all with your knowledge and direction ?’ </p><p> The big, bull neck of the president swelled, and</p><p>his hands clenched and reclenched as he stared with </p><p>gleaming eyes into the face of the young man who </p><p>thus challenged him. </p><p> “You are thinking now, I suppose, Mr. Welter,”</p><p>Trant replied to his glare, “that such evidence as </p><p>that directly against you cannot be got before a </p><p>court. I am not so sure of that. But at least it can </p><p>go before the public to-morrow morning in the </p><p>papers, attested by the signatures of the scientific </p><p>men who witnessed the test. It has been photo- </p><p>graphed by this time, and the photographic copies </p><p>are distributed in safe places, to be produced with</p><p>the original on the day when the Government brings </p><p>criminal proceedings against you. If I had it here </p><p>I would show you how complete, how merciless, is </p><p>the evidence that you knew what was being done. </p><p>I would show you how at the point marked 1 on the </p><p>record your pulse and breathing quickened with </p><p>alarm under my suggestion; how at the point </p><p>marked 2 your anxiety and fear increased; and how </p><p>at 3, when the spring by which this cheating had </p><p>been carried out was before your eyes, you betrayed </p><p>yourself uncontrollably, unmistakably. How the </p><p>volume of blood in your second finger suddenly </p><p>diminished, as the current was thrown back upon </p><p>your heart; how your pulse throbbed with terror; </p><p>how, though unmoved to outward appearance, you </p><p>caught your breath, and your laboring lungs strug- </p><p>gled under the dread that your wrong doing was </p><p>discovered and you would be branded—as I trust </p><p>you will now be branded, Mr. Welter, when the </p><p>evidence in this case and the testimony of those </p><p>who witnessed my test are produced before a jury </p><p>—a deliberate and scheming thief!” </p><p> “--you!” The three words escaped from</p><p>Welter’s puffed lips. He put out his arm to push </p><p>aside the customs officer standing between him and </p><p>the door. Dickey resisted. </p><p> “Let him go, if he wants to!” Trant called to</p><p>the officer. “He can neither escape nor hide. His </p><p>money holds him under bond!” </p><p>The officer stepped aside, and Welter, without an- </p><p>(Continued on page 867) </p><p> STfie Time Eliminator</p><p>They beheld a little two-scatod Ford, 1904 mode!, bumping and swaying along the Boston Post Road just west of the state Une.

Across the face of the cabinet were three </p><p>dials, but here the resemblance to radio reception </p><p>ceased, for these dials bore the legends “Longitude,” </p><p>“Latitude” and “Altitude” respectively. A fourth </p><p>dial, perhaps eight inches in diameter, was located </p><p>above the others and this one bore the inscription </p><p>“Time-Space.” </p><p> Within was a bewildering array of tubes, wires</p><p>and lamps and in front of all these, a curious ar- </p><p>rangement of revolving mirrors, the speed of which </p><p>was controlled by a knob at the right of the cab- </p><p>inet. One pair of wires connected the cabinet with </p><p>a small dynamo, while a second set led to a 100-foot </p><p>aerial pole outside the house itself. </p><p> It was while in his senior year at Yale that Er-</p><p>rell’s researches into the strange relationship exist- </p><p>ing between light and electricity attracted so much </p><p>attention. Indeed he was in a fair way of becom- </p><p>ing a celebrity when he suddenly dropped from </p><p>public view and betook himself to a secluded village </p><p>called Arshamomoque, at the eastern end of Long </p><p>Island, where the Errell family maintained a Sum- </p><p>mer residence. </p><p> The house itself, known locally as “The Mansion,”</p><p>stood on a hill overlooking the Sound, but suffi- </p><p>ciently back from the highway to insure a desirable </p><p>degree of privacy. A spacious tower, originally de- </p><p>signed for an observatory, had been converted into </p><p>a research laboratory and here, surrounded by the </p><p>most modern apparatus, young Errell worked fever- </p><p>ishly on his new invention,—an invention which, </p><p>even in its unfinished condition, had already pro- </p><p>duced results so far-reaching in their consequences </p><p>and so revolutionary from a scientific point of view, </p><p>that at times the young </p><p>man almost questioned his </p><p>own sanity. </p><p>A Wonderful Projecting </p><p>Machine </p><p>AND now the ma- </p><p>chine was com- </p><p>pleted. The young</p><p>inventor straightened up, </p><p>took a deep breath and </p><p>reached for a cigar. As </p><p>he did so, the word </p><p>“Havana” popped into his. </p><p>mind. </p><p> “Well, why not?” he</p><p>queried. “I’ll try Havana for my first real test and </p><p>see how the ponies are running today.” </p><p> Whereupon he consulted a map, noted the longi-</p><p>tude and latitude of that city and twirled the dials </p><p>of the cabinet to correspond. Then, looking at his </p><p>watch, which showed 3 p.m., he adjusted the upper </p><p>dial to 2:30 o’clock, the corresponding time for </p><p>Havana. </p><p> A moment’s hesitation, and then he reached over</p><p>and threw a little switch, at the same time placing </p><p>his other hand on the knob that controlled the re- </p><p>volving mirrors. A faint buzz and then a stream of </p><p>light from the cabinet illumined a white screen on </p><p>the opposite wall. </p><p> At first there was but a confused blur, but as</p><p>he slowly turned the knob backward and forward </p><p>this presently crystallized into a panoramic view of </p><p>the Havana race-track, revealing the grandstand </p><p>thronged with wildly excited spectators and three </p><p>foam-specked horses tearing down the home stretch </p><p>almost neck and neck. </p><p> Even as Errell watched, they flashed over the</p><p>line and a moment later the name of the winner, </p><p>“Muchacho,” appeared on the bulletin board. </p><p> “Hot stuff!” he commented. “Now for the next</p><p>test.” </p><p> Slowly, almost solemnly, he turned the upper dial</p><p>to the left,—five, ten, fifteen, twenty notches. </p><p> “That should be the year 1906,” he said, "the</p><p>year of the great earthquake at San Francisco.” </p><p> Consulting his map again, he adjusted the lower</p><p>dials, allowing 100 feet for altitude, and again threw </p><p>the switch. </p><p> As before, the picture first appeared as an indis-</p><p>tinguishable blur, and then it changed gradually to </p><p>a clearly-defined birdseye view of the stricken city. </p><p>And now he could behold great buildings come </p><p>crashing down, throngs of panic-stricken citizens </p><p>scurrying through the streets in wild disorder, </p><p>with here and there the smoke of incipient fires.</p><p> For some time he watched the awe-inspiring</p><p>spectacle, then threw the cut-out switch and reset </p><p>the dials. </p><p> “Now I’ll try for ‘distance,’ as the radio fans</p><p>would put it,” he chuckled, jubilant over his suc- </p><p>cess thus far. </p><p>Seeing St. Joan of Arc </p><p> Reaching up, he twirled the top dial rapidly to</p><p>the left, with reckless disregard of this annihilation </p><p>of time and space, until the indicator registered the </p><p>year 1428! </p><p> “This should convince</p><p>the most skeptical,” he </p><p>said. “I’ll take a peek at </p><p>France in those bygone </p><p>days.” </p><p> He thereupon computed</p><p>carefully the location of </p><p>the city of Orleans and </p><p>made the proper adjust- </p><p>ments on the lower dials. </p><p>Then, confident but deeply </p><p>impressed at the thought </p><p>of what was to come, he </p><p>once more threw the </p><p>switch and regulated the </p><p>speed of the revolving mirrors until the pictures </p><p>on the screen synchronized with the actual event. </p><p> “My God! It’s Joan of Arc!” he cried, as across</p><p>the silver screen in serried ranks, swept the attack- </p><p>ing army at the siege of Orleans'. At their head, </p><p>clad in brightly shining armor, flashing sword up- </p><p>lifted and a look of exaltation on her face, rode the </p><p>Warrior Maid! </p><p> Minute after minute he sat there with bated</p><p>breath,—tremulous with excitement, awed and yet </p><p>elated. And then, as he was resetting the dials, </p><p> TF we may believe Einstein, there can be nothing faster</p><p> in our universe than light, moving at the rate of 186,-</p><p> 000 miles per second. If Einstein is right, then the excel-</p><p> lent story printed here is impossible. But no one knoivs.</p><p> Perhaps it IS possible to catch up with the light rays that</p><p> have gone into the beyond. If it is possible to do so, we</p><p> should be able to photograph or throw on a screen at</p><p> some future date how Columbus actually discovered</p><p> America, and other famous historical events.</p><p> At any rate, THE TIME ELIMINATOR demands</p><p>your attention. A very clever explanation is given of a</p><p>wonderful apparatus that does it all and is of great in- </p><p>terest. </p><p>804 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>a thought came into his mind that sobered him with </p><p>a jolt. Ten minutes later he was speeding towards </p><p>New York in his big Mercer. </p><p> At precisely 5 p.m. he was shown into the private</p><p>office of Brig.-General Humiston, commanding the </p><p>new secret intelligence department of the Washing- </p><p>ton government. </p><p>Brig.-General Humiston and His Daughter </p><p>NOT only the General but, unknown to him, his </p><p>daughter also, had long taken a deep interest </p><p>in young Errell, the latter's father and the </p><p>General having been classmates at West Point. This </p><p>interest was fully reciprocated, especially in the </p><p>case of the daughter,—a vivacious exponent of the </p><p>younger set. </p><p> But it was in his capacity as a government official</p><p>that Erreil had called on General Humiston, having </p><p>determined to proffer his services and the services </p><p>of his invention as well to the country of his birth. </p><p> “Well, my boy,” boomed the gruff old soldier,</p><p>"What’s on your mind? And why haven’t you been </p><p>to see us for so long? Jerry thinks you have for- </p><p>gotten her entirely.” </p><p> "General,” broke in the young man, ignoring his</p><p>inquiry, “can you jump into my car and come down </p><p>to my place on Long Island at once? I have some- </p><p>thing to show you, something so breath-taking in </p><p>its possibilities and of such tremendous importance </p><p>to your department that every moment counts.” </p><p>“Are you in earnest?” demanded the General, sit- </p><p>ting up with a jerk. “You want me to break a the- </p><p>atre engagement with Jerry and go with you now?” </p><p>"Precisely that,” replied Errell gravely; then, </p><p>hopefully: “Why not bring Jerry with you?” </p><p> "Call at the Biltmore in one hour,” was the re-</p><p>ply in curt, military tones. “One or both of us will </p><p>be ready to go with you.” </p><p> Errell’s hand went up in salute, he turned smartly</p><p>on his heel and left the room. </p><p> Promptly on the hour, the General appeared at</p><p>the motor entrance of the hotel, followed closely by </p><p>Jerry,—bewitching in rich furs and silken coat. </p><p>Errell’s heart thumped riotously as he leaped from </p><p>the car and met her with outstretched hands. </p><p> “Oh Jerry,” he cried, “It's good to see you,” and</p><p>his eyes fully confirmed the words. </p><p> “I’m from Missouri,” was that young person’s</p><p>flippant reply, but the words could not disguise the </p><p>wonderful glow of happiness that irradiated the </p><p>lovely little face. </p><p> Once out of the city, the big car sped down the</p><p>island, roaring past sleepy farms and villages as </p><p>it tore through the night, and as the clock struck </p><p>9 they drew up at the Errell doorstep. </p><p> Little was said on the outward trip, but once in-</p><p>Bide the house the General asked: </p><p> “Now, Errell, what’s it all about? I hope you</p><p>haven’t dragged me down here on a wild goose </p><p>chase.” </p><p> “Come up to my laboratory,” was Errell’s reply.</p><p>He waited a second, then added: “You too, Jerry.” </p><p>She gave him a quick glance of appreciation. </p><p>Explanation of the Invention </p><p>A MOMENT more and they were in the lab- </p><p>oratory, Jerry and her father looking with </p><p>Crank curiosity at the mysterious cabinet. </p><p> "General, and you too, Jerry,” began Errell very</p><p>soberly. “What I am about to show you ?s some- </p><p>thing so fantastic, so weird, so utterly removed </p><p>from all human experience, that before proceeding </p><p>further I feel I should prepare your minds for </p><p>what you are to behold. Please be seated and fol- </p><p>low closely.” He paused, then went on: </p><p> "When the dynamo at a power-house breaks down,</p><p>every trolley car on that system stops and the elec- </p><p>tricity in the overhead wire and in the dynamo it- </p><p>self disappears,—swallowed up in the earth’s gen- </p><p>eral store of electric force. Unless this electricity </p><p>can be made to reappear, by starting up the dynamo </p><p>again, street-car service on that system is a thing </p><p>of the past. This is obvious. Now for the next </p><p>step: </p><p> “You know how moving pictures are made, with</p><p>a blas6 photographer turning a crank while the </p><p>villain chokes the heroine. Once the lights are </p><p>switched off, however, the scene has passed into ob- </p><p>livion,—unless or until it is resurrected by project- </p><p>ing the film on to a screen. What few people realize, </p><p>is that every event on this earth leaves a record in </p><p>light rays, whether or not a human photographer </p><p>is present to snap the picture. </p><p> “In other words, light rays persist, or endure,</p><p>since nothing is lost in Nature. To illustrate: </p><p>Through the medium of a powerful telescope we are </p><p>now able to get a view of celestial bodies which, </p><p>without the aid of this instrument, would necessi- </p><p>tate a journey of years in their direction in order </p><p>to obtain a corresponding view. If a cataclysm </p><p>should destroy the Martian canals today and we </p><p>should travel towards that planet in a projectile at </p><p>the rate of a mile a minute, it would take years ere </p><p>we reached a point in space where the event would </p><p>become visible to our eyes; or, if we elected to re- </p><p>main here, it would take just that much longer be- </p><p>fore the event would appear to the inhabitants of </p><p>this sphere. </p><p> “Again, consider the curious paradox presented</p><p>last New Year’s eve, when couples in London danced </p><p>by radio during the last moments of 1925 to music </p><p>played in Berlin in 1926, and then, a few moments </p><p>later, danced in 1926 to music being played in New </p><p>York in 1925. An evening paper in San Francisco </p><p>might truthfully have stated on December 31st: </p><p>‘The West End club of London danced the old year </p><p>out at 4 o’clock this afternoon,’ while a London </p><p>paper on the morning of January 1st might with </p><p>equal truth have announced: ‘The Waikiki club of </p><p>Honolulu will dance the New Year in at 10:30 </p><p>o'clock this forenoon.’ </p><p>Time is a Measure of Space </p><p>“T7*ROM this you can readily comprehend that </p><p>W Time is but a measure of space. Now for </p><p> JL the final step:</p><p> “In order to reproduce a past scene in Nature,</p><p>two problems arise: First, that of reproducing the </p><p>light rays in their proper sequence. As I stated be- </p><p>fore, nothing is lost in Nature, although it may </p><p>change its form. So, just a3 electricity can be made </p><p>to manifest itself again after disappearing, so also </p><p>can light rays, which persist, be made to reappear, </p><p>although no longer visible to the eye. It is not </p><p>essential that the identical light rays of the </p><p>former scene be brought back; only that th© ray* </p><p>THE TIME ELIMINATOR </p><p>805 </p><p>shall appear in their former sequence and intensi- </p><p>ties. If you strike a church bell and repeat the </p><p>blow ten years later, you reproduce the tone of that </p><p>bell perfectly, although you do not get the original </p><p>sound wave. </p><p> Projecting the General’s Last Sunday’s Ride</p><p>«*rnr^HE second problem,—that of correlating the </p><p>present position of this earth with the exact </p><p>■ position in space which it occupied at the </p><p>instant the event actually happened,—is more com- </p><p>plex, involving as it does intricate problems in </p><p>geometry, gravitational force, relativity, the earth’s </p><p>movement through space and other factors too com- </p><p>plicated for the lay mind.” </p><p> Errell waited a moment, to give his hearers time</p><p>to grasp the significance of this last statement, then </p><p>resumed: </p><p> “These problems, General, have been solved in the</p><p>machine before you, as 1 shall now proceed to dem- </p><p>onstrate. Where were you on Sunday morning at </p><p>9 o’clock?” </p><p> "I was out for a morning canter in Rock Creek</p><p>Park, Washington,” replied General Humiston, im- </p><p>pressed in spite of himself. </p><p> “Watch the screen in front of you,” commanded</p><p>Errell, meanwhile adjusting the dials of the cabinet. </p><p> A subdued buzzing noise, and then before the as-</p><p>tonished gaze of the General and his daughter there </p><p>unrolled a panorama of the City of Magnificent Dis- </p><p>tances, converging presently on the bridle path in </p><p>Rock Creek park. A moment later the figure of </p><p>General Humiston, mounted on his big grey charger, </p><p>came galloping into view. </p><p>The Most Secret Plans An Open Book </p><p>Y God!” exclaimed that doughty soldier, </p><p>springing to his feet. “Do you realize, </p><p>boy, what this invention would mean to </p><p>your government? Why, the most secret plans of </p><p>an enemy would be an open book to us.” </p><p> “It was for just that reason that I have brought</p><p>you here,” replied the young man, gravely. “Be- </p><p>fore we go further into that, however, is there any- </p><p>thing of special interest to your department right </p><p>now that you would like to know?” </p><p> “You couldn’t teil me, could you,” asked the Gen-</p><p>eral, stepping nearer in his excitement, “just who </p><p>were present at a secret conference at Fontaine- </p><p>bleau last Tuesday at 10 a.m.?” </p><p> “Just a moment,” cautioned Errell, as he read-</p><p>justed the dials and made the proper allowance for </p><p>time and distance. “Now watch the screen.” </p><p> Again a faint buzzing noise, then the light</p><p>flashed on and first came the Eiffel tower into view, </p><p>with its flaring automobile advertisement, and then </p><p>Fontainebleau. Even as they watched, a closed car </p><p>drovp 'ip and the French Minister of Commerce </p><p>alighted and disappeared within the building. Then </p><p>came the English Secretary of Commerce and Italy’s </p><p>representative, followed a moment later by the Rus- </p><p>sian Commissioner. Promptly on the hour the Ger- </p><p>man Minister of Trade and Industries drove up </p><p>and joined the others. </p><p> Errell glanced at the General, who was trembling</p><p>with eagerness, exultation and almost with fear. </p><p>“Yes,” he muttered audibly, “they are all there; </p><p>I know every one of them.” He was silent a moment. </p><p>The </p><p> “I presume you have an inkling of what this con-</p><p> ference means, Errell. The idea is for each govern-</p><p> ment here represented to control some commodity</p><p> that is absolutely essential to American industry</p><p> and then to boost the price to a figure so prohibitive</p><p> as to provoke reprisals. These will then be seized</p><p> upon as a pretext for the breaking of treaties; the</p><p> next step is a world war against the United States</p><p> —our tremendous store of gold the main objective.”</p><p> “But it takes money to finance a war these days,”</p><p> objected Errell.</p><p> “Precisely, and therein is our strongest defense,"</p><p> was the answer. “With fore-knowledge of what is</p><p> contemplated, our bankers can shut down on further</p><p> loans abroad and curtail European credits. This</p><p> machine will enable us to prepare for any contin-</p><p> gency; by revealing every plan of the enemy, we can</p><p> make this country practically impregnable.”</p><p> “That is just it,” replied Errell.</p><p> “The first thing,” broke in the General, “is to</p><p> safeguard your discovery. Should but a whisper</p><p> of what you have accomplished get abroad, your life</p><p> would not be worth a candle.”</p><p> “I have thought of that,” said the younger man,</p><p> “and for greater secrecy I think the machine should</p><p> be kept here, rather than in Washington where in-</p><p> evitably there would be a leak sooner or later. You</p><p> could run down here for frequent visits.”</p><p> “Yes, but I would have to have a very plausible</p><p> reason for those visits,” interposed the General.</p><p> The Apparatus Wins the Bride</p><p>ELL,” — and here Errell paused and </p><p>glanced at Jerry, who nodded brightly,— </p><p>“why not spend your week-ends here with </p><p>Jerry and your new son-in-law? We expect to be </p><p>married in June.” </p><p> “What? What’s that?” shouted the old General,</p><p> “Jerry your wife! How do you get that way, young</p><p> man?” and he tried to look very stern. “In my</p><p> day,” he added virtuously, “it was customary for</p><p> the young lady’s parents to be consulted.”</p><p> “Um-m,” mused Errell. “Would you mind telling</p><p> me in what year you were married?”</p><p> “I know!” cried Jerry, delightedly. “They were</p><p> married in Greenwich, Connecticut, just 22 years</p><p> ago today, at 5 o’clock in the afternoon.”</p><p> “Hey! Wait a minute,” exclaimed her father, in</p><p> evident confusion, as Errell stepped to the little</p><p> cabinet, but he was too late. Already the machine</p><p> had given its preliminary buzz and the next mo-</p><p> ment they beheld a little two-seated Ford, 1904</p><p> model, bumping and swaying along the Boston Post</p><p> road just west of the state line. Perhaps half a</p><p> mile behind them came a horse and buggy, the irate</p><p> driver lashing his foam-flecked steed in a vain at-</p><p> tempt to overtake the fleeing couple in the car.</p><p> Errell glanced at Jerry, then at her father, and</p><p> back to the picture. There could be no mistake!</p><p> The girl in the little Ford might have been Jerry</p><p> herself, save for the difference in dress, while the</p><p> handsome young chap at her side, his eyef glued to</p><p> the road, bore a resemblance to her father Ho strik-</p><p> ing as to dispel any doubt of his identity.</p><p> “You win!” laughed the General, wiping his eyes.</p><p> “Take her, my boy, and may you be as h?ony as we</p><p> were.”</p><p>End </p><p>^through ^Grater’s Rim </p><p>9&amp;£&amp;cHyattG)/errill ~*'4 </p><p>Author of “Beyond the Pole.” </p><p>But even as I gazed, transfixed with horror, paralysed by the sight, the vine threw its last coil about the dying man and before </p><p>my eyes drew the quivering body into the tree above. Then something approached my leg. With a wild yell of terror 1 leaped </p><p>aside. A second vine was vritfaing and twisting over the ground towards me. </p><p>806 </p><p>THROUGH THE CRATER’S RIM </p><p>807 </p><p>CHAPTER I </p><p>Into the Unknown </p><p>you it's there,” declared Lieu- </p><p>Hazen decisively. “It may not be </p><p>zed city, but it’s no Indian village </p><p>ve town. It’s big—at least a thou- </p><p>ouses—and they’re built of stone </p><p>or something like it and not of thatch.” </p><p> “You've been dreaming, Hazen,” laughed Fenton.</p><p>“Or else you’re just trying to jolly us.” </p><p> “Do you think I’d hand in an official report of a</p><p>dream?” retorted the Lieutenant testily. “And it's </p><p>gospel truth I've been telling you.” </p><p> “Never mind Fenton,” I put in. “He’s a born</p><p>pessimist and skeptic anyhow. How much did you </p><p>actually see?” </p><p> We were seated on the veranda of the Hotel</p><p>Washington in Colon and the aviator had been re- </p><p>lating how, while making a reconnoissance flight </p><p>over the unexplored and unknown jungles of Darien, </p><p>he had sighted an isolated, flat topped mountain </p><p>upon whose summit was a large city—of a thousand </p><p>houses or more—and without visible pass, road or </p><p>stream leading to it. </p><p> “It was rotten air,” Hazen explained in reply to</p><p>my question. "And I couldn’t get lower than 5,000 </p><p>feet. So I can’t say what the people were like. But </p><p>I could see ’em running about first time I went over </p><p>and they were looking mightily excited. Then I </p><p>flew back for a second look and not a soul was in </p><p>sight—took to cover I expect. But I’ll swear the </p><p>buildings were stone or 'dobe and not palm or </p><p>thatch.” </p><p> “Why didn’t you land and get acquainted?” en-</p><p>quired Fenton sarcastically. </p><p> “There was one spot that looked like a pretty</p><p>fair landing,” replied the </p><p>aviator. “But the air was </p><p>bad and the risk too big. </p><p>How did I know the peo- </p><p>ple weren’t hostile? It </p><p>was right in the Kuna </p><p>Indian country and even </p><p>if they were peaceable </p><p>they might have smashed </p><p>the plane or I mightn’t</p><p>have been able to take off. </p><p>I was alone too.” </p><p> “You say you made an</p><p>official report of your dis- </p><p>covery,” I said. “What </p><p>did the Colonel think about it?” </p><p> “Snorted and said he didn’t see why in blazes I</p><p>bothered reporting an Indian village.” </p><p> “It’s mighty interesting,” I declared. “I believe</p><p>you've actually seen the Lost City, Hazen. Balboa </p><p>heard of it. The Dons spent years hunting for it </p><p>and every Indian in Darien swears it exists.” </p><p>“Well, I never heard of it before,” said Hazen, </p><p>“What’s the yarn, anyway?” </p><p> “According to the Indian story there’s a big city</p><p>on a mountain top somewhere in Darien. They say </p><p>no one has ever visited it, that it’s guarded by evil </p><p>spirits and that it was there ages before the first </p><p>Indians.” </p><p>“If they’ve never seen it how do they know it’s </p><p>there?” Fenton demanded. “In my opinion it’s all </p><p>bosh. How can there be a ‘lost city’ in this bally </p><p>little country and why hasn’t someone found it? </p><p>Why, there are stories of lost cities and hidden </p><p>cities and such rot in every South and Central </p><p>American country. Just fairy tales—pure bunk!” </p><p>“I know there are lots of such yarns,” I admitted. </p><p>“And most of them I believe are founded on fact. </p><p>Your South American Indian hasn’t enough imag- </p><p>ination to make a story out of whole cloth. It’s </p><p>easy to understand why and how such a place might </p><p>exist for centuries and no one find it. This ‘little </p><p>country’ as you call it could hide a hundred cities in </p><p>its jungles and no one be the wiser. No civilized </p><p>man has ever yet been through the Kuna country. </p><p>But I’m going. I’ll have a try for that city of </p><p>Hazen’s.” </p><p> “Well, I wish you luck,” said Fenton. “If the</p><p>Kunas don’t slice off the soles of your feet and turn </p><p>you loose in the bush and if you do find Hazen’s </p><p>pipe dream, just bring me back a souvenir, will </p><p>you ?” </p><p> With this parting shot he rose and sauntered off</p><p>towards the swimming pool. </p><p> “Do you really mean to have a go at that place?"</p><p>asked Hazen as Fenton disappeared. </p><p> “I surely do,” I declared. “Can you show me the</p><p>exact spot on the map where you saw the city?” </p><p> For the next half hour we pored over the map</p><p>of Panama and while—owing to the incorrectness </p><p>of the only available maps—Hazen could not be </p><p>sure of the exact location of his discovery, still he </p><p>pointed out a small area within which the strange </p><p>city was located. </p><p> “You’re starting on a mighty dangerous trip,”</p><p>he declared a3 I talked over my plans. “Even if you </p><p>get by the Kunas and find the place how are you </p><p>going to get out? The </p><p>people may kill you or </p><p>make you a prisoner. If </p><p>they’ve been isolated for </p><p>so long I reckon they </p><p>won’t let any news of </p><p>’em leak out.” </p><p> “Of course there’s a</p><p>risk,” I laughed. “That’s </p><p>what makes it so attrac- </p><p>tive. I’m not worried over </p><p>the Kunas though. </p><p>They’re not half as bad as </p><p>painted. I spent three </p><p>weeks among them two </p><p>years ago and had no trouble. They may drive me </p><p>back, but they don’t kill people offhand. Getting out </p><p>will be the trouble as you say. But I’ve first got to </p><p>get in and I’m not making plans to get out until </p><p>then.”	&lt;</p><p> “Lord, but I wish I were going too!” cried Hazea.</p><p>“Say, I tell you what I’m going to do. I’ll borrow </p><p>that old Curtiss practice boat and fly over there </p><p>once in a while. If you’re there, just wave a white </p><p>rag for a signal. Maybe the people'll be so darned </p><p>scared if they see the plane that they’ll not trouble </p><p>you. Might make a good play of it—let ’em think </p><p>you’re responsible for it you know.” </p><p> “I don’t know but that’s a mighty good scheme,</p><p>Hazen,” I replied, after a moment’s thought. “Let’s </p><p>TELL </p><p>tenant </p><p>a civili </p><p>or nati </p><p>sand h </p><p> TN this story the author of "Beyond the Pole” gives us</p><p> another one of his amazing contributions to Scicnti-</p><p> fiction.

A few days later I was being </p><p>paddled and poled up the Canazas River with the </p><p>last outposts of civilization many miles behind and </p><p>the unknown jungles and the forbidden country of </p><p>the wild Kunas ahead. </p><p> It was with the greatest difficulty that I had been</p><p>able to secure men to accompany me, for the natives </p><p>looked with the utmost dread upon the Kuna coun- </p><p>try and only two, out 6f the scores I had asked, </p><p>were willing to tempt fate and risk their lives in </p><p>the expedition into the unknown. </p><p> For two days now we had been within the forbid-</p><p>den district—the area guarded and held by the </p><p>Kunas and into which no outsider is permitted to </p><p>enter—and yet we had seen or heard no. signs of </p><p>Indians. But I was too old a hand and too familiar </p><p>w’ith the ways of South American Indians to delude </p><p>myself with the idea that we had not been seen or </p><p>our presence known. I well knew that, in every </p><p>likelihood, we had been watched and our every </p><p>movement known since the moment we entered the </p><p>territory. No doubt, sharp black eyes were constant- </p><p>ly peering at us from the jungle, while bows and </p><p>blowguns were ever ready to discharge their mis- </p><p>siles of death at any instant. As long as we were not </p><p>molested or interfered with, however, I gave little </p><p>heed to this. Moreover, I believed, from my brief </p><p>acquaintance with the Kunas of two years previ- </p><p>ously, that they seldom killed a white man until </p><p>after he had been warned out of their country and </p><p>tried to return to it. </p><p> At night we camped beside the river, making our</p><p>beds upon the warm dry sand and each day we </p><p>poled the cayuca up the rapids and deeper into the </p><p>forest. At last we reached the spot where, accord- </p><p>ing to my calculations, we must strike through the </p><p>jungle overland to reach the mountain seen by </p><p>Hazen. Hiding our dugout in the thick brush be- </p><p>side the river we packed the few necessities to be </p><p>carried with us and started off through the forest. </p><p> If Hazen were not mistaken in his calculations,</p><p>we should reach the vicinity of the mountain in </p><p>two days’ march, even though the going was hard </p><p>and we were compelled to hew a way with our</p><p>machetes for miles at a stretch. </p><p> But it’s one thing to find a mountain top when</p><p>flying over the sea of jungle and quite another to </p><p>find that mountain when hidden deep in the forest </p><p>and surrounded on every side by enormous trees. I </p><p>realized that we might easily pass within a few </p><p>hundred yards of the spot and never suspect it and </p><p>that we might wander for days, searching for the </p><p>mountain without finding it. It was largely a mat- </p><p>ter of luck after all. But Hazen had described the </p><p>surrounding country so minutely, that I had high </p><p>hopes of success. </p><p> By the end of the first day in the bush we had</p><p>reached rough and hilly country, which promised </p><p>well, and it was with the expectation of reaching the </p><p>base of the mountain the following day that we </p><p>made camp that night. Still we had seen no Indians, </p><p>no signs of their trails or camps, which did much </p><p>to calm the fears of my men and which I accounted </p><p>for on the theory that the Kunas avoided this part </p><p>of the country through superstitious fears of the </p><p>lost city and its people. </p><p> At daybreak we broke camp and had tramped for</p><p>perhaps three hours when, without warning, Jose, </p><p>who was last in line, uttered a terrified cry. Turn- </p><p>ing quickly I was just in time to see him throw up </p><p>his hands and fall in a heap with a long arrow </p><p>quivering in his back. The Kunas were upon us. </p><p> Scarcely had the realization come to me when</p><p>an arrow thudded sharply into a tree by my side and </p><p>Carlos, with a wild yell of deadly fear, threw down </p><p>his load and dashed madly away. Not an Indian </p><p>could be seen. To stand there, a target for their </p><p>missiles, was suicidal, and turning, I fled at my ut- </p><p>most speed after Carlos. How we managed to run </p><p>through that tangled jungle is still a mystery to </p><p>me, but we made good time, nevertheless. Fear </p><p>drove us and dodging between the giant trees, leap- </p><p>ing fallen trunks, tripping over roots and scrambl- </p><p>ing over rocks, wre sped on. </p><p> And now, from behind, we could hear the sounds</p><p>of the pursuing Indians; their low gutteral cries, </p><p>the sounds of breaking twigs and branches; con- </p><p>stantly they w'ere drawing nearer. I knew that in </p><p>a few minutes they would be upon us—that at any </p><p>instant a poisoned blowgun dart or a barbed arrow </p><p>might bury itself in my body; but still we strove </p><p>to escape. </p><p> Then, just as I felt that the end must be at hand</p><p>—just as I had decided to turn and sell my life dear- </p><p>ly—the forest thinned. Before us sunlight appeared</p><p>and the next moment we dashed from the jungle in- </p><p>to a space free from underbrush but covered with </p><p>enormous trees draped with gnarled and twisted </p><p>lianas. The land here rose sharply and, glancing </p><p>ahead between the trees, I saw the indistinct out- </p><p>lines of a lofty mountain against the sky. </p><p> Toiling up the slope, breathing heavily, utterly</p><p>exhausted, I kept on. Then, as a loud shout sound- </p><p>ed from the rear, I turned to see five hideously </p><p>painted Kunas break from the jungle. But they did </p><p>not follow. To my utter amazement they halted, </p><p>gave a quick glance about, and, with a chorus of </p><p>frightened yells, turned and dashed back into the </p><p>shelter of the jungle. </p><p> But I had scant time to give heed to this. The</p><p>Kunas’ cries were still ringing in my ears when a </p><p>scream from Carlos drew my attention. Thinking </p><p>him attacked by savages I rushed towards him, </p><p>drawing my revolver as I ran. </p><p> With bulging, rolling eyes, blanched face and</p><p>ghastly, terror stricken features he was struggling, </p><p>fighting madly, with a writhing, coiling gray ob- </p><p>ject which I took for a gigantic snake. Already his </p><p>body and legs were bound and helpless in the coils. </p><p>With his machete he was raining blows upon the </p><p>quivering awful thing which slowly, menacingly </p><p>wavered back and forth before him, striving to </p><p>throw another coil about his body. </p><p> And then, as I drew near, my senses reeled, I</p><p>felt that I was in some awful nightmare. The ob- </p><p>ject, so surely, relentlessly, silently encircling and </p><p>crushing him was no serpent but a huge liana </p><p>drooping from the lofty branches of a great tree! </p><p>THROUGH THE CRATER’S RIM </p><p>809 </p><p> It seemed absolutely incredible, impossible, un-</p><p>believeable. But even as I gazed, transfixed with </p><p>horror, paralyzed by the sight, the vine threw its </p><p>last coil about the dying man and before my eyes </p><p>drew the quivering body into the trees above. </p><p> Then something touched my leg. With a wild</p><p>yell of terror I leaped aside. A second vine was </p><p>writhing and twisting over the ground towards </p><p>me! </p><p> Crazed with unspeakable fear I struck at the</p><p>thing with my machete. At the blow the vine drew </p><p>sharply back while from the gash a thick, yellow- </p><p>ish, stinking juice oozed forth. Turning, I started </p><p>to rush from the accursed spot but as I passed the </p><p>first tree another liana writhed forward in my path. </p><p> Utterly bereft of my senses, slashing madly as I</p><p>ran, yelling like a madman, I dodged from tree to </p><p>tree, seeking the open spaces, evading by a hair’s </p><p>breadth the fearful, menacing, aerpent-like vines, </p><p>until half-crazy, torn, panting and utterly spent I </p><p>dashed forth into a clear grassy space. </p><p> Before me, rising like a sheer wall against the</p><p>sky was a huge precipitous cliff of red rock. </p><p> Now I knew why the Kunas had not followed us</p><p>beyond the jungle. They were aware of the man- </p><p>killing lianas and had left us to a worse death than </p><p>any they could inflict. I was safe from them I felt </p><p>sure. But was I any better off? Before me was an </p><p>impassable mountain side. On either hand and in </p><p>the rear those awful, blood-thirsty, sinister vines </p><p>and, lurking in the jungles, were the savage Kunas </p><p>with their fatal poisoned darts and powerful bows. </p><p>I was beset on every side by deadly peril, for I was </p><p>without food, I had cast aside my gun and even </p><p>my revolver in my blind, terror-crazed escape from </p><p>those ghastly living vines, and to remain where I </p><p>was meant death by starvation or thirst. </p><p> But anything was better than this nightmare-</p><p>like forest. At the thought I glanced with a shud- </p><p>der at the trees and my blood seemed to freeze in </p><p>my veins. </p><p> The forest was approaching me! I could not be-</p><p>lieve my eyes. Now I felt I must be mad, and fas- </p><p>cinated; hypnotized, I gazed, striving my utmost </p><p>to clear my brain, to make common sense contradict </p><p>the evidence of my eyes. But it was no delusion. </p><p>Ponderously, slowly, but steadily the trees were </p><p>gliding noiselessly up the slope! Their great</p><p>gnarled roots were creeping and undulating over the </p><p>ground while the pendant vines writhed and swayed </p><p>and darted forth in all directions as if feeling their </p><p>way. And then I saw what had before escaped me. </p><p>The things were not lianas as I had thought. They </p><p>were parts of the trees themselves—huge, lithe, </p><p>flexible tentacles springing from a thick, fleshy </p><p>livid-hued crown of branches armed with stupend- </p><p>ous thorns and which slowly opened and closed like </p><p>hungry jaws above the huge trunks. </p><p> It was monstrous, uncanny, supernatural. A</p><p>hundred yards and more of open ground had </p><p>stretched between me and the forest when I had </p><p>flung myself down, but now a scant fifty paces re- </p><p>mained. In a few brief momenta the fearsome </p><p>things would be upon me. But I was petrified, in- </p><p>capable of moving hand or foot, too terrified and </p><p>overwhelmed even to cry out. </p><p> Nearer and nearer the ghastly things came. I</p><p>could hear the pounding of my heart. A cold </p><p>sweat broke out on my body. I shivered as with </p><p>ague. Then a long, warty, tentacle darted towards </p><p>me and as the loathsome stinking thing touched </p><p>my hand the spell was broken. With a wild scream </p><p>I turned and dashed blindly towards the precipice, </p><p>seeking only to delay, only to avoid for a time the </p><p>certain awful death to which I was doomed, for the </p><p>cliff barred all escape and I could go no farther. </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>Amazing Discoveries </p><p>A DOZEN leaps and I reached the wall of rock </p><p>beyond which all retreat was cut off. Close </p><p>at hand was an out jutting buttress, and </p><p>thinking that back of this I might hide and thus </p><p>prolong my life, I raced for it. </p><p> Panting, unseeing, I reached the projection,</p><p>ducked behind it, and to my amazement and un- </p><p>speakable delight, found myself in a narrow canyon </p><p>or defile, like a huge cleft in the face of the preci- </p><p>pice. </p><p> Here was safety for a time. The terrible man-</p><p>eating trees could not enter, and striving only to </p><p>put a greater distance between myself and the veg- </p><p>etable demons I never slackened my pace as I turned </p><p>and sped up the canyon. </p><p> Narrower and narrower it became. Far above</p><p>my head the rocky walls leaned inward, shutting out </p><p>the light until soon it was so dim and shadowy that, </p><p>through sheer necessity, I was forced to stop run-</p><p>ning and to pick my way carefully over the masses </p><p>of rock that strewed the canyon’s floor. Presently </p><p>only a narrow ribbon of sky was visible between the </p><p>towering walls of the pass. Then this was blotted </p><p>out and I found myself in the inky blackness of a </p><p>tunnel—an ancient watercourse—leading into the </p><p>very bowels of the mountain. </p><p> But there was no use in hesitating. Anything</p><p>was preferable to the cannibal trees, and groping </p><p>my way I pressed on. Winding and twisting, turn- </p><p>ing sharply, the passageway led, ever ascending </p><p>steeply and taxing my exhausted muscles and over- </p><p>wrought system to the utmost. Then, far ahead, I </p><p>heard the faint sound of dripping, falling water and </p><p>with joy at thought of burying my aching head in </p><p>the cold liquid, and of easing my parched, dry </p><p>throat, I hurried, stumbling, through the tunnel. </p><p> At last, I saw a glimmer of light in the distance</p><p>and in it the sparkle of the water. Before me was </p><p>the end of the tunnel and sunlight and with a final </p><p>spurt of speed I rushed towards it. Then, just as I </p><p>gained the opening, and so suddenly and unexpect </p><p>edly that he seemed to materialize from thin air. </p><p>a man rose before me. </p><p> Unable to check my speed, too thunderstruck at</p><p>the apparition to halt, I dashed full into him and </p><p>together we rolled head over heels upon the ground. </p><p> I have said he was a man. But even in that brief</p><p>second that I glimpsed him, before I bowled him </p><p>over, I realized that he was unlike any man I or </p><p>anyone else had ever seen. Barely three feet in </p><p>height, squat, with enormous head and shoulders, he </p><p>stood shakily upon the tiniest of bandy legs and </p><p>half supported his weight by his enormously long </p><p>muscular arms. Had it not been that he was partly </p><p>810 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>clothed and that his face wag hairless, I should </p><p>have thought him an ape. And now, as I picked </p><p>myself up and stared at him, my jaws gaped in ut- </p><p>ter amazement. The fellow was running from me at </p><p>top speed upon his hands, his feet waving and sway- </p><p>ing in the air! </p><p> So utterly dumbfounded was I at the sight that I</p><p>stood there silently gazing after the strange being </p><p>until he vanished behind a clump of bushes. Then </p><p>as it dawned upon me that no doubt there were </p><p>others near, and, that as he had shown no sign of </p><p>hostility, they were likely peaceable, I hurried after </p><p>him. </p><p> A narrow trail led through the brush and running</p><p>along this I burst from the shrubbery and came to </p><p>an abrupt halt, utterly astounded at the sight which </p><p>met my eyes. I was standing at the verge of a little </p><p>rise beyond which stretched an almost circular, </p><p>level plain several miles in diameter. Massed upon </p><p>this in long rows, compact groups and huge squares, </p><p>were hundreds of low, flat-roofed, stone buildings, </p><p>while upon a smooth green plot at a little distance, </p><p>stood a massive truncated pyramid. </p><p> Unwittingly I had reached my goal. Eefore me</p><p>was the lost city of Darien. Hazen had been right! </p><p> But it was not this thought nor the strange city</p><p>and its buildings that held my fascinated gaze, but </p><p>the people. Everywhere they swarmed. Upon the </p><p>streets, the housetops, even on the open land of the </p><p>plain, they crowded and each and every one an ex- </p><p>act counterpart of the one with whom I had collided </p><p>at the mouth of the tunnel. And, like him too, all </p><p>were walking or running upon their hands with </p><p>their feet in air! </p><p> All this I saw in the space of a few seconds.</p><p>Then, to add to my astonishment, I saw that many </p><p>of the impossible beings actually were carrying </p><p>burdens in their upraised feet! Some bore baskets, </p><p>others jars or pots, others bundles, while one group </p><p>that was approaching in my direction, held bows </p><p>and arrows in their toes, and held them most men- </p><p>acingly at that! </p><p> It was evident that I had been seen. The excite-</p><p>ment of the beings, their gestures and the manner </p><p>in which they peered towards me from between </p><p>their arms, left no doubt of it, while the threaten- </p><p>ing defensive attitude of the bowmen proved that </p><p>they were ready to attack or defend at a moment’s </p><p>notice.</p><p> No doubt, to them, my appearance was as re-</p><p>markable, as inexplicable and as amazing as they </p><p>were to me. The greater portion were evidently </p><p>filled with terror and scurried into their houses, </p><p>yet many still stood their ground, while a few were </p><p>so overcome with curiosity and surprise that they </p><p>dx-opped feet to earth and rested right side up in </p><p>order to stare at me more intently. </p><p> I realized that it behooved me to do something.</p><p>To stand there motionless and speechless, gazing </p><p>at the strange folk while they stared back, would </p><p>accomplish nothing. But what to do, what move to </p><p>make? That was a serious question. If I attempt- </p><p>ed to approach them a shower of arrows might well </p><p>end my career and my investigations of the place </p><p>then and there. It was equally useless to retrace </p><p>my steps, even had I been so minded, for only cer- </p><p>tain death lay back of me. By some means I must </p><p>win the confidence or friendship of these outland- </p><p>ish beings if only temporarily. A thousand ideas </p><p>flashed through my mind. </p><p> If only Hazen would appear the creatures of the</p><p>city might think I had dropped from the sky and so </p><p>look upon me as a supernatural being. But it was </p><p>hopeless to expect such a coincidence or to look for </p><p>him. I had told him to fly over on the tenth day </p><p>and this was only the seventh. If only I had re- </p><p>tained my revolver the discharge of the weapon </p><p>might frighten them into thinking me a god. But </p><p>my firearms lay somewhere in the demon forest. I </p><p>had heard no sounds of voices, no shouting, and I </p><p>wondered if the beings were dumb. Maybe, I </p><p>thought, if I should speak—should yell—-I might </p><p>impress them. But, on the other hand, the sound </p><p>of my voice might break the spell and cause them </p><p>to attack me. A single mistake, the slightest false </p><p>move, might seal my doom. I was in a terrible </p><p>quandary. All my former experiences with savage </p><p>unknown tribes passed through my mind, and I </p><p>strove to think of some incident, some little event, </p><p>which had saved the day in the past and might be </p><p>put to good use now. </p><p> And as I thus pondered I unconsciously reached</p><p>in my pocket for my pipe, filled it with tobacco and </p><p>placing it between my lips, struck a match and </p><p>puffed forth a cloud of smoke. Instantly, from the </p><p>weird creatures, a low, wailing, sibilant sound </p><p>arose. The archers dropped their bows and arrows </p><p>and, with one accord, the people threw themselves </p><p>grovelling on the ground. Unintentionally I had </p><p>solved the problem. To these beings I was a fire- </p><p>breathing, awful god! </p><p> Realizing this, knowing that when dealing with</p><p>primitive races full of superstitions one must in- </p><p>stantly follow up an advantage, I hesitated no </p><p>longer. Puffing lustily at my pipe I strode forward </p><p>and approached the nearest prostrate group. Mo- </p><p>tionless they buried their faces in the dust, bodies </p><p>pressed to earth, not daring to look up or even </p><p>steal a surreptitious glance at the terrible, smoke- </p><p>belching being who towered over them. Never had </p><p>I seen such a demonstration of abject fear, such </p><p>utter debasement. It really was pitiful to see them, </p><p>to view their trembling, panting bodies quivering </p><p>with nameless terror; terror so great they dared </p><p>not flee, even though they knew by my footsteps </p><p>that I was among them, and feared that at any </p><p>moment an awful doom might descend upon them. </p><p> But their very fright defeated my purpose. I had</p><p>won safety and even adoration perhaps, but there </p><p>could be no amity, no intercourse, no means _of </p><p>mingling with them, of securing food, of learning </p><p>anything if they were to remain cowering on the </p><p>ground. By some means I must win a measure of </p><p>their confidence, I must prove that I was a friendly </p><p>beneficent deity and yet I must still be able to im- </p><p>press them with my powers and control them </p><p>through fear. </p><p> It was a delicate matter to accomplish, but it had</p><p>to be done. Almost at my feet lay one of the arch- </p><p>ers—a leader or chieftain I thought from the feath- </p><p>er ornaments he wore—and stooping, I lifted him </p><p>gently. At my touch he fairly palpitated with ter- </p><p>THROUGH THE CRATER’S RIM </p><p>811 </p><p>ror, but no frightened scream, no sound save an in- </p><p>drawn snake-like hiss, escaped his lips, and he of- </p><p>fered no resistance as I lifted him to a kneeling </p><p>position. </p><p> Hitherto I had hid no opportunity to obtain a</p><p>good view of these peopla, but now I saw this fel- </p><p>low close at hand I was amazed at his repulsive </p><p>ugliness. I have seen some rather ugly races, but </p><p>all of them combined and multiplied a hundredfold </p><p>would be beauties compared to these dwarfed, top- </p><p>sy-turvy, denizens of the lost city. Almost black, </p><p>low browed, with tiny, shifty eyes like those of a </p><p>reptile, with enormous, thick lipped mouths, sharp, </p><p>fang-like teeth and matted hair, the bowman </p><p>seemed far more like an ape than like a human be- </p><p>ing. And then I noticed a most curious thing. He </p><p>had no ears! Where they should have been were </p><p>merely round, bare spots covered with light colored </p><p>thin membrane like the ears of a frog. For an in- </p><p>stant I thought it a malformation or an injury. But </p><p>as I glanced at the others I saw that all were the </p><p>same. Not one possessed a human ear! All this I </p><p>took in as I lifted the fellow up. Then as he </p><p>tremblingly raised his head and eyed me I spoke to </p><p>him, trying to make ray tones gentle and reassuring. </p><p>But there was no response, no sign of intelligence </p><p>or understanding in his dull, frightened eyes. There </p><p>was nothing to do but to fall back on sign language </p><p>and rapidly I gestured, striving to convey to him </p><p>that I would do no injury or harm, that I was </p><p>friendly and that I wished the people to rise. </p><p> Slowly a look of comprehension dawned upon his</p><p>ugly face and then, to prove my friendship, I </p><p>fished in my pocket, found a. tiny mirror and placed </p><p>it in his hand. At the expression of utter astonish- </p><p>ment that overspread his ugly features as he looked </p><p>in the glass I roared with laughter. But the mir- </p><p>ror won the day. Uttering sharp, strange, hissing </p><p>sounds, the fellow conveyed the news to his com- </p><p>panions and slowly, hesitatingly and with lingering </p><p>fear still on their faces, the people rose and gazed </p><p>upon me with strangely mingled awe and curiosity. </p><p> Mainly they were men, but scattered among them</p><p>were many who evidently were women, although all </p><p>were so uniformly repulsive in features that it was </p><p>difficult to distinguish the sexes. All too, were </p><p>clad much alike in single garments of bark-cloth </p><p>resembling gunnysacks with holes cut at the four </p><p>corners for legs and arms and an opening for the </p><p>head. </p><p> But while there was no variation in the form</p><p>or material of the clothing yet some wore orna- </p><p>ments and others did not. Leg and arm bands of </p><p>woven fibre were common. Many of the men had </p><p>decorations of bright hued feathers attached to </p><p>arms or legs or fastened about their waists and </p><p>many were elaborately tattooed. That such primi- </p><p>tive dwarfed, ugly, degenerate creatures could have </p><p>built the city of stone houses, could have laid out </p><p>the broad paved streets and could have developed so </p><p>much of civilization, seemed incredible. </p><p> But I had little time to devote to such thoughts.</p><p>The fellow I had presented with the mirror was </p><p>hissing at me like a serpent and by signs was try- </p><p>ing to indicate that I was to follow him. So, with </p><p>the crowd trailing behind us, we started up the </p><p>road towards the centre of the city. </p><p> CHAPTER III</p><p> Before the King</p><p>TIULY no stranger jJrocession had ever been </p><p>seen by human eyes. </p><p>Before me, the chief archer led the way, </p><p>walking upon his great calloused hands and with </p><p>his bow grasped firmly in one prehensile foot and </p><p>his precious mirror in the other. On either side </p><p>and in the rear were scores of the weird beings </p><p>hurrying along on their hands, keeping up an in- </p><p>cessant hissing sound like escaping steam; black </p><p>legs and feet waving and gesticulating in air and, at </p><p>first glance, appearing like a crowd of headless </p><p>dwarfs. How I wished that Fenton might have been </p><p>there to see! </p><p> Apparently my actions had been closely watched</p><p>from the safe retreats of the houses and word pass- </p><p>ed that I was not to be feared, for as we reached </p><p>the first buildings, the edges of the roofs and the </p><p>tiny window slits were lined with curious, ugly faces </p><p>peering at us. It was then that I noticed that none </p><p>of the buildings had doors, the walls rising blank </p><p>to the roofs save for the narrow windows, while </p><p>ladders, here and there in place, proved that the </p><p>inhabitants, like the Pueblo Indians, entered and </p><p>left their dwellings through the roofs. </p><p> Now and then as we passed along, some of the</p><p>more venturesome beings would join the procession, </p><p>scrambling nimbly down the ladders, sometimes up- </p><p>side down on their hands, often using both hands </p><p>and feet, but always using hands only as soon as </p><p>they reached the ground. </p><p> How or why they had developed this extraor-</p><p>dinary mode of progression puzzled me greatly, for</p><p>there seemed no scientifically good reason for it. </p><p>Among tribes who habitually use boats, weak legs </p><p>and enormously developed shoulders, chests and </p><p>arms are common, and I could well understand how </p><p>a race, depending entirely upon water for trans- </p><p>portation, might, through generations of inbreed- </p><p>ing and isolation, lose the use of legs. </p><p> But here was a people who apparently had no</p><p>conveyances of any kind, who must of necessity </p><p>travel about to cultivate their crops, who must </p><p>carry heavy burdens in order to construct their </p><p>buildings and to whom legs would seem a most im- </p><p>portant matter, and yet with legs and feet so </p><p>atrophied and arms so tremendously developed that </p><p>they walked on their hands and used their feet as </p><p>auxiliaries. It was a puzzle I longed to solve and </p><p>that I would have investigated thoroughly had fate </p><p>permitted me to dwell longer in the strange city. </p><p>But I am getting ahead of my story. </p><p> Presently we reached a large central square sur-</p><p>rounded by closely set buildings. Approaching one </p><p>of these, my guide signalled that I was to follow </p><p>him as he swiftly ascended the ladder to the roof. </p><p>Rather hesitatingly, for I doubted if the frail affair </p><p>would support my weight, I climbed gingerly up </p><p>and found myself upon the broad, flat roof. Before </p><p>me were several dark openings with the ends of </p><p>ladders projecting from them and down one of these </p><p>812 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>my guide led the way. At the bottom of the ladder </p><p>I was in a large, obscure room, lit only by the slits </p><p>of windows high in the walls, and for a moment I </p><p>could see nothing of my surroundings, although </p><p>from all sides issued the low hissing sounds that I </p><p>now knew were the language of these remarkable </p><p>people. Then, as my eyes became accustomed to </p><p>the dim light, I saw that a score of beings were </p><p>squatted about the sides of the room, while, directly </p><p>before me, on a raised dais or platform, was seated </p><p>the largest and ugliest individual I had seen. </p><p> That he was a ruler, a king or high priest, was</p><p>evident. In place of the sack-like garment of his </p><p>people he was clad in a long robe of golden green </p><p>feathers. Upon his head was a feather crown of </p><p>the same hue. About his wrists and ankles were </p><p>golden bands studded with huge uncut emeralds, </p><p>and a string of the same stones hung upon his </p><p>chest. </p><p> The throne, if such it could be called, was draped</p><p>with a green and gold rug and everywhere, upon the </p><p>walls of the chamber, were paintings of strange </p><p>misshapen, uncouth creatures and human beings all </p><p>in the same green and yellow tints. Something in </p><p>the surroundings, in the drawings and the costume </p><p>of the king, reminded me of the Aztecs or Mayas </p><p>and while quite distinct from either I felt sure </p><p>that, in some long past time, these dwellers of the </p><p>lost city had been influenced by or had been in con- </p><p>tact with, these ancient civilizations. </p><p> As I stood before the dais my guide prostrated</p><p>himself before the green robed monarch and then, </p><p>rising, carried on what appeared to be an animated </p><p>account of my arrival and the subsequent happen- </p><p>ings. </p><p> As he spoke, silence fell upon those present and</p><p>the king listened attentively, glancing now and then </p><p>at me and regarding me with an expression of com- </p><p>bined fear, respect and enmity. I could readily </p><p>understand what his feelings were. No doubt he </p><p>•was a person of far greater intelligence than his </p><p>subjects, and while more or less afraid of such </p><p>a strange being as myself, and superstitious enough </p><p>to think me supernatural, yet in me he saw a pos- </p><p>sible usurper of his own power and prominence </p><p>and, if he had dared, he would have been only too </p><p>glad to have put me out of the way. </p><p> At the end of the archer’s narrative the fellow</p><p>handed his mirror to the king who uttered a sharp </p><p>exclamatory hiss as he saw his own ugly counten-</p><p>ance reflected in it. Forgetting court etiquette and </p><p>conventions in their curiosity, the others gathered </p><p>about and as the mirror passed from hand to hand </p><p>their amazement knew no bounds. </p><p> All of these men I now saw were clad in green</p><p>or green and white and were evidently of high rank, </p><p>priests or courtiers I took it, but otherwise were </p><p>as undersized and repulsive as the common people </p><p>on the streets. </p><p> Suddenly I was aroused from my contemplation</p><p>of the room and its occupants by my guide who </p><p>came close and by signs ordered me to perform the </p><p>miracle of smoking. Very ceremoniously and de- </p><p>liberately I drew out my pipe, filled it and struck </p><p>a match. At the bright flare of the flame king and </p><p>courtiers uttered a wailing hiss of fear and threw </p><p>themselves upon the floor. But they were of dif- </p><p>ferent stuff from their people, or else the guide had </p><p>prepared them for the event, for the king soon </p><p>raised his head, and glancing dubiously at me and </p><p>finding I had not vanished in fire and smoke, as </p><p>he no doubt expected, he resumed his sitting pos- </p><p>ture and in sharp tones ordered his fellows to do </p><p>likewise. </p><p> But despite this it was very evident that he and</p><p>his friends were in dread of the smoke from my </p><p>mouth and nose while the tobacco fumes caused </p><p>them to sputter and cough and choke. This at last </p><p>was more than even the king could stand, and by </p><p>signs he made it clear that he wished me to end </p><p>the demonstration of my fire eating ability. Then </p><p>he rose, and, to my unbounded surprise, stood erect </p><p>and stepped forward like an ordinary mortal upon </p><p>his feet. Here was an extraordinary thing. Was </p><p>the king of a distinct race or stock or was the use </p><p>of nether limbs for talking confined to the royal </p><p>family or to individuals? </p><p> It was a fascinating scientific problem to soive.</p><p>I had no time to give it any consideration, however, </p><p>for the king was now addressing me in his snake- </p><p>like dialect and was trying hard to make his mean- </p><p>ing clear by signs. For a moment I was at a loss, </p><p>but presently I grasped his meaning. He was asking </p><p>whence I had come, and from the frequency with </p><p>which he pointed upward I judged he thought I. </p><p>had dropped from the sky. </p><p> Then a brilliant idea occurred to me as I re-</p><p>membered Hazen’s story and his suggestion regard- </p><p>ing his return by plane. Pointing upward I made </p><p>the best imitation of a motor’s exhaust that I could </p><p>manage. There was no doubt that the monarch </p><p>grasped my meaning. He grinned, nodded and</p><p>swept his arm in a wide semicircle around his head, </p><p>evidently to represent the course of the plane when </p><p>Hazen had flown over the city. </p><p> Seemingly satisfied and, I judged, deeply impress-</p><p>ed as well, he resumed his seat, gave a few orders </p><p>to his fellows and summoning my guide spoke a </p><p>few words to him. Thereupon the archer signalled </p><p>me to follow and led the way across the room. But </p><p>I noticed that the king had not returned the mirror. </p><p> Ascending the ladder to the roof the fellow hur-</p><p>ried across to a second building, scrambled down </p><p>another ladder and we entered a large room. In </p><p>one corner swung a large fiber hammock; in the </p><p>centre was spread a cloth decorated in green and </p><p>gold, and as we entered two women appeared, each </p><p>carrying handsome earthenware dishes of food </p><p>whose savory odors whetted my already ravenous </p><p>appetite. </p><p> Marvelous as it was to see these impossible beings</p><p>carrying food in their uplifted feet and walking on </p><p>their hands, yet I had now become somewhat ac- </p><p>customed to the people and I was so famished that </p><p>I hardly gave the upside down serving maids a </p><p>second glance. </p><p> The food was excellent—consisting of vegetables,</p><p>some sort of fricasseed game and luscious fruits— </p><p>and as I ate my guide squatted near and regarded </p><p>me with the fixed, half adoring, half frightened look </p><p>that one sees on the face of a strange puppy. </p><p> I judged that he had been appointed my own per-</p><p>THROUGH THE CRATER’S RIM </p><p>813 </p><p>sonal guard or valet—it mattered little which—and </p><p>I was not sorry, for he seemed a fairly decent speci- </p><p>men of his race and we already had become pretty </p><p>well accustomed to each other's signs and gestures. </p><p>Wishing to still further establish myself in his </p><p>confidence, and feeling rather sorry for him because </p><p>of the loss of his treasured mirror, I searched my </p><p>pockets for some other trinket. My possessions </p><p>however were limited. They consisted of a stub of </p><p>a leadpencil, a note book, a few coins, my handker- </p><p>chief, my watch, my pocketknife, a few loose pistol </p><p>cartridges, my pipe and tobacco and a box of </p><p>matches. As I drew all these out a sudden fear </p><p>gripped me. I had barely a dozen matches remain- </p><p>ing and my supply of tobacco was perilously low. </p><p>What would happen when I could no longer pro- </p><p>duce fire and smoke when called upon to do so? </p><p> But I controlled my fears and comforted myself</p><p>with the thought that possibly, after having felt </p><p>the effects of tobacco smoke, the king would not </p><p>soon demand another miracle at my hands and </p><p>that, before either matches or tobacco was exhaust- </p><p>ed, something might well happen to solve any prob- </p><p>lems that might arise. Nevertheless I heartily wish- </p><p>ed that I had arranged with Hazen to bring supplies </p><p>in case they were needed and which he could have </p><p>easily dropped as he flew over. </p><p> It would, I now realized, have proved an extreme-</p><p>ly impressive thing for the people to have seen me </p><p>secure my magic from the giant roaring bird in </p><p>the sky. But I had never of course dreamed of </p><p>such adventures as I had met and could not possibly </p><p>have foreseen the need of such things. Just the </p><p>same I cursed myself for a stupid fool for not hav- </p><p>ing provided for any contingency and especially for </p><p>not having arranged a series of signals with Hazen. </p><p>However, I was familiar with wigwagging and de- </p><p>cided that, if necessity arose, It would be quite </p><p>feasible for me to signal to him by means of my </p><p>handkerchief tied on a stick. Also, I felt a bit </p><p>easier in my mind from knowing that near the city </p><p>was a splendid landing place for the plane and that </p><p>Hazen, if signalled, would unquestionably attempt </p><p>a descent. </p><p> Truly it was not every explorer in a predicament</p><p>like mine who could count on being able to summon </p><p>aid from the clouds if worst came to worst or who </p><p>knew that a friend in an airplane would keep track </p><p>of his whereabouts. Indeed, I almost chuckled at </p><p>the thought of being in this long lost city among </p><p>these incredible folk and yet within two hundred </p><p>miles of the Canal and civilization and with another</p><p>American due to hover above—and even communi- </p><p>cate with me—within the next three days. It was </p><p>all so dreamlike, so utterly preposterous that I </p><p>scarcely could force myself to believe it and, having </p><p>dined well and feeling desperately tired, I flung </p><p>myself into the hammock and almost instantly drop- </p><p>ped off to sleep. </p><p> It was still daylight when I awoke and the room</p><p>was empty. Ascending the ladder to the roof with- </p><p>out meeting anyone, I climbed down the other lad- </p><p>der to the street. Many people were about and </p><p>while a few* especially the women and children, </p><p>threw themselves on their faces or scampered into </p><p>their houses at my approach, yet the majority </p><p>merely prostrated themselves for a moment and </p><p>then stood, supporting themselves in their ape-like </p><p>way, and stared curiously at me. I had gone but a </p><p>short distance when my valet came hurrying to- my </p><p>side. But he made no objections to my going where </p><p>I wished and I was glad to see that my movements </p><p>were not to be hampered as I was anxious thorough- </p><p>ly to explore the city and its neighborhood. Curious </p><p>to learn the purpose of the pyramidal structure I </p><p>had noticed I proceeded in that direction and was </p><p>soon in a part of the town given over to stalls, shops </p><p>and markets. There were also several workshops, </p><p>such as pottery makers’, a woodworking shop and </p><p>a weaver's shop and I spent , some time watching </p><p>the artizans at their work. Somehow, from seeing </p><p>the people walk upon their hands, I had expected to </p><p>see them perform their tasks with their feet and </p><p>it came as something of a surprise to see these fel- </p><p>lows using their hands like ordinary mortals. </p><p> Beyond this portion of the city the houses were</p><p>scattered, the outlying buildings were more or less </p><p>patched and out of repair and were very evidently </p><p>the' abode of the poorer classes, although the in- </p><p>habitants I saw, and who retreated the instant they </p><p>saw me, were exactly like all the others as far as </p><p>I could see, both in dress and feature. Passing </p><p>these huts, I crossed the smooth green field, which </p><p>I now saw was a perfect landing place for the plane. </p><p>Tethered to stakes and grazing on the grass were </p><p>a number of animals which, as I first noticed them, </p><p>I had taken for goats and cattle. But now I dis- </p><p>covered that they were all deer and tapirs. It was </p><p>a great surprise to see these animals domesticated </p><p>but, after all, it was not remarkable, for I should </p><p>have known, had I stopped to give the matter </p><p>thought, that goats, sheep and cattle were unknown </p><p>to the aboriginal Americans and that this city and </p><p>its people, who had never been visited and had </p><p>never communicated with other races, would of </p><p>necessity be without these well known animals. </p><p> Moreover, I knew that the Mayas were supposed</p><p>to have used tapirs as beasts of burden, and while </p><p>I was standing there watching the creatures a man </p><p>approached riding astride a big tapir and driving </p><p>a second one loaded with bags of charcoal and gar- </p><p>den produce. Here then was a partial solution of </p><p>the manner by which these weak, dwarfed people </p><p>built their stone houses. For with the powerful </p><p>elephant-like tapirs—and I noticed all were the </p><p>giant Baird’s tapir which reaches a weight of </p><p>seven or eight hundred pounds—they could easily </p><p>haul the blocks of stone from a quarry and by means </p><p>of tackle and inclined planes, could readily hoist </p><p>the stones to the tops of the walls. </p><p> I had now reached the base of the pyramid and</p><p>found it a massive structure of the same flinty </p><p>stone as the other buildings. Running from base to </p><p>summit was a spiral path or stairway and instantly </p><p>I knew that it was a sacrificial pyramid exactly like </p><p>those used by the Aztecs and on which unfortunate </p><p>beings were killed and sacrificed. This discovery </p><p>still further confirmed my suspicions that these peo- </p><p>ple were either of Aztec or Maya blood or had been </p><p>influenced by those races. Filled with curiosity to </p><p>see the altar on the summit I started up the sloping </p><p>stairs. I was at first doubtful if my companion </p><p>814 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>would permit this, for the structure was sacred </p><p>and doubtless only priests of the highest order were </p><p>permitted upon it. Evidently, however, my guide </p><p>thought that such a supernatural being or god as </p><p>myself had every right to invade the most sacred </p><p>places, and he offered no objection, but prostrated </p><p>himself at the base of the pyramid as I ascended. </p><p> At the summit I found, as I had expected, the</p><p>sacrificial stone, a huge block elaborately carved in </p><p>hieroglyphs and with channels to permit the blood </p><p>to drain off, while, close at hand, was a massive </p><p>carved stone collar or yoke exactly like those which </p><p>have been found in Porto Rico and have so long </p><p>puzzled scientists. From the blood stains upon </p><p>this I felt sure it was used to hold down the victim's </p><p>head and neck, while strong metal staples, set into </p><p>the p stone, indicated that the man destined for </p><p>sacrifice was spread-eagled and his ankles and wrists </p><p>bound fast to the rings. </p><p> It was a most interesting spot from a scientific</p><p>standpoint, but decidedly gruesome, while the stench </p><p>of putrefied blood and fragments of human flesh </p><p>clinging to the stones was nauseating and I was </p><p>glad to retrace my steps and descend to the ground. </p><p> From the top of the pyramid I had obtained a fine</p><p>view of the plain and city and I had noted that the </p><p>former was surrounded on all sides with steep cliffs, </p><p>and I realized that the plain was not a flat topped </p><p>mountain as I had thought but the crater of an ex- </p><p>tinct volcano. </p><p> I saw no path, pass or opening by which the</p><p>crater-valley could be entered, but I knew there </p><p>was the one by which I had arrived. As the sun, </p><p>here on the mountain top, was still well above the </p><p>horizon I decided to visit the entrance to the tunnel, </p><p>for I was anxious to know why the people should </p><p>leave this avenue open when, on every other side, </p><p>they were completely cut off from the outer world. </p><p>Possibly, I thought, they knew of those horrible </p><p>man-eating trees and trusted to them to guard the </p><p>city from intruders. Or again, they might keep the </p><p>entrance guarded, for the fellow I had knocked over </p><p>as I dashed in had been at the tunnel mouth and for </p><p>all I knew he might have been an armed guard and </p><p>was merely so thunderstruck at my precipitate ap- </p><p>pearance that he forgot his duties and his weapons. </p><p> With such thoughts running through my mind I</p><p>strolled across the plain, past well-tilled gardens </p><p>and fields, in several of which I saw men ploughing </p><p>with well made plows drawn by tapirs. Even the</p><p>farmers stopped their work and prostrated them- </p><p>selves as I passed, and it was evident that word of </p><p>my celestial origin and supernatural character had </p><p>gone forth to every inhabitant of the valley. </p><p> Following the path, I reached the little rise from</p><p>which I had first viewed the city and soon came to </p><p>the spot where I had entered. Imagine my utter </p><p>surprise when I saw no sign whatever of the open- </p><p>ing. I was positive that I had not missed my way. </p><p>I recognized the clumps of bushes and the forms of </p><p>the rocks, but there was no dark hole, no aperture </p><p>in the cliff. Then, as I drew near to the precipice, </p><p>I made an astounding discovery. Closely fitted into </p><p>the rock and so like it that it had escaped my at- </p><p>tention, was an enormous stone door. How it was </p><p>operated, whether it was hinged or slid or whether </p><p>it was pivoted, I could not determine. But that it </p><p>covered and concealed the entrance to the tunnel </p><p>I was convinced. Why the people had left the tun- </p><p>nel open as though to clear the way for me, why </p><p>they should have fitted a door to it, why they should </p><p>ever use the tunnel which could bring them only </p><p>to the death-dealing forest, were problems which I </p><p>could not solve. </p><p> At any rate there was nothing to be gained by</p><p>staying there and I started back towards the city. </p><p>Thinking to return by another route, I took a path </p><p>that led towards the opposite mountain side and </p><p>presently from ahead, I distinctly heard the sound </p><p>of metal striking stone. </p><p> Oddly enough my mind had been so filled with</p><p>other matters that I had hardly wondered how these </p><p>people cut or worked the hard stone. But now that </p><p>my attention was attracted by the sound my curios- </p><p>ity was aroused and I hurried forward. What metal </p><p>I wondered, did these people use? For metal I </p><p>knew it must be from the ringing, clinking noise. </p><p>Was I about to see hardened bronze tools in actual </p><p>use or had these marvelous folk discovered the use </p><p>of iron or steel? So astounding had been all my </p><p>experiences, so paradoxical and incredible every- </p><p>thing I had seen, that I was prepared for almost </p><p>anything. I, or rather we, soon came to the verge </p><p>of a deep pit wherein, laboring at great masses of </p><p>white stone, were scores of workmen. Standing </p><p>like skeletons among the blocks were derricks; </p><p>hitched to sledge-like drags loaded with stone were </p><p>teams of tapirs and on the farther side was a big </p><p>out jutting ledge from which the stone was being </p><p>quarried. Hurrying down the steep trail I reached </p><p>the bottom of the pit to find every man flat on the </p><p>ground. </p><p> Signalling to my companion that I wished to have</p><p>the fellows go on with their work, I approached the </p><p>nearest slab of rock. It was the same fine grained </p><p>whitish rock of which the city was built, and, lying </p><p>upon it where they had been dropped by the stone </p><p>cutters, were several small hammers, chisels and an </p><p>adze-like tool. That they were not bronze or any </p><p>alloy of copper I knew at the first glance. Their </p><p>color was that of tempered steel and they seemed </p><p>ridiculously small for the purpose of working this </p><p>hard stone. If these people used steel then I had </p><p>indeed made a discovery, and intent on this matter </p><p>I picked up one of the tools to examine it. No </p><p>sooner had I lifted it that I uttered an involuntary </p><p>exclamation of surprise. The hammer, although </p><p>hardly larger than an ordinary tack hammer, </p><p>weighed fully ten pounds! It was heavier than if </p><p>made of solid gold. There was only one known </p><p>metal that could be so heavy and that was platinum. </p><p>But platinum it could not be, for that metal is </p><p>softer than gold and would be of no more use for </p><p>cutting rock than so much lead. The tools, however, </p><p>were undoubtedly hard—the polished surface of the </p><p>hammer-head and the chisels, and the unscarred </p><p>keen edges of the latter, showed this, and, anxious </p><p>to test their hardness, I held a chisel against the </p><p>rock and struck it sharply with a hammer. </p><p> Once more I cried out in wonder, for the chisel</p><p>had bitten fully half an inch into the stone! It </p><p>had cut it as easily as if the rock were cheese! </p><p>THROUGH THE .CRATER’S RIM </p><p>815 </p><p>What marvel was this? What magic lay in these </p><p>tools? And then the secret dawned upon me and a </p><p>moment’s examination of the stone confirmed my </p><p>suspicions. It was not that the tools were so very </p><p>hard or keen but that the rock was soft—so soft </p><p>that I could readily cut it with my pocket knife, </p><p>a wax-like earthy rock which no doubt became hard </p><p>upon exposure to the air exactly like the coral rock </p><p>of Bermuda, which may be quarried with saws and </p><p>even planed, but becomes as hard as limestone after </p><p>exposure to the elements. Still, the tools were far </p><p>harder than any metal except tempered steel, and </p><p>for some time I puzzled over the matter as I watched </p><p>the workmen, now over their fright and adoration, </p><p>skilfully cutting and squaring the blocks of stone. </p><p>It was one more conundrum I could not solve, and </p><p>it was not until long afterwards, when a careful </p><p>analysis of the metal was made, that I knew the </p><p>truth. The metal was an alloy of platinum and </p><p>iridium—the later one of the hardest of all known </p><p>metals. </p><p> As we left the quarry and made our way toward</p><p>the city I noticed an immense aqueduct stretching </p><p>across the land from the apparently solid mountain </p><p>side just above the quarry. I had given little </p><p>thought to how the people secured water here in the </p><p>crater. But it was now apparent that it was brought </p><p>from some source by the stone conduit. Keenly </p><p>curious to know whence it came, for I could not </p><p>imagine how a river, lake or spring could exist on </p><p>the crater rim, I wished to investigate, but darkness </p><p>was coming on, I was tired and I deferred further </p><p>exploration until another day. </p><p> Although I suppose I should have been grateful</p><p>for being able to communicate with the people at </p><p>all, yet I keenly felt the lack of a common medium </p><p>of conversation, for the sign language was limited </p><p>and I could not secure the information I so much </p><p>desired about many matters that puzzled me. </p><p> Nothing further of interest transpired that night.</p><p>I was supplied with food, I slept soundly and did </p><p>not awaken until roused by the women with my </p><p>breakfast. Very soon afterwards I was summoned </p><p>to the throne room by Zip, as I called my companion, </p><p>and once more I had to strike a match and smoke </p><p>my pipe for the king’s benefit. This time a second </p><p>personage of high rank was beside him, a villainous </p><p>looking hunchbacked dwarf with red, vicious eyes </p><p>and cruel mouth but who, like the king, walked on </p><p>his feet. From his elaborately decorated white robes </p><p>and the mitre-like crown of quetzal feathers on his </p><p>gray head, I concluded he was a high priest, for</p><p>in the designs upon his costume and the form of </p><p>his crown, I saw a decided resemblanoe to the Aztec </p><p>priests as shown in the picturegraph of that race. </p><p>Moreover, the quetzal or resplendant trogon was, </p><p>I knew, the sacred bird of the Aztecs and Mayas, </p><p>and while I was aware that it was common in the </p><p>northern portions of Panama, I had never heard of </p><p>its occurrence in Darien, a fact which still further </p><p>confirmed my belief that these people were of Aztec </p><p>stock. But if this were the ease it was a puzzle as </p><p>to why they should be so undersized, malformed and </p><p>physically degenerate, for both the Aztecs and </p><p>Mayas were powerful, well-formed races. The </p><p>only solution I could think of was the supposition </p><p>that isolation and intermarriage through centuries </p><p>had brought about such results. </p><p> But to return to my audience with the king. I</p><p>was not all pleased at thus having to use my </p><p>precious matches and tobacco and I foresaw some </p><p>very unpieasant developments in store for me if the </p><p>performance was to be of daily occurrence. It was </p><p>manifest that I must devise some new and startling </p><p>exhibition of my powers if I were to retain my </p><p>prestige and my freedom, for I well knew, from </p><p>past experiences with savage races, and from the </p><p>character of these potentates, that if I failed to </p><p>perform miracles, and became, in their eyes, an or- </p><p>dinary mortal, my career would come to an abrupt </p><p>end. </p><p> To be sure, there was the reassuring fact that</p><p>Hazen would or should appear within the next forty- </p><p>eight hours, but it was decidedly problematical as </p><p>to whether I could communicate with him or could </p><p>receive any aid from the air. However, there was </p><p>nothing to be done but obey and puff away at my </p><p>pipe. With the idea of cutting the exhibition short </p><p>I stepped closer to the throne and blew the smoke </p><p>towards the faces of the king and the priest. The </p><p>monarch was soon coughing and spluttering, but </p><p>he was game, while the priest, to my amazement, </p><p>sniffed the smoke and seemed to enjoy it. Here was </p><p>trouble. Evidently he had a natural taste for tobac- </p><p>co and this fact caused me a deal of worry, for if </p><p>the old rascal took it into his head to acquire the </p><p>habit and demanded I should let him try a puff at </p><p>the pipe I would be in a pretty fix indeed. </p><p> However, my fears on this score were groundless,</p><p>and presently the king, who could stand it no longer, </p><p>signalled for me to depart, which I did most gladly. </p><p> I still had it in mind to investigate the water</p><p>supply, and with Zip—reminding me of an aero- </p><p>batic down—beside me, headed for the aqueduct. </p><p>This I found was of stones, dovetailed together in</p><p>water tight joints, and built like an open trough </p><p>and the speed of the water flowing through it proved </p><p>the supply well above the city’s level. It was an </p><p>easy matter to follow the conduit, for a well-trodden </p><p>path was beside it, but it was a steep up-grade climb </p><p>for nearly a mile before I gained the spot where </p><p>the aqueduct tapped the mountain rim. Here the </p><p>water gushed from a hole in the solid rock and </p><p>from its volume I knew it must come from some </p><p>large reservoir. From where I stood I could look </p><p>directly down into the quarry and the thought flash- </p><p>ed through my mind that if the people continued </p><p>to quarry in the place for many more years they </p><p>would undermine and weaken the foundations of the </p><p>aqueduct. </p><p> It was their lookout not mine, however, and still</p><p>intent on tracing the water to its source I turned </p><p>up a trail that appeared to lead to the mountain </p><p>top. In places this was excessively steep and here </p><p>Zip exhibited a new habit of his people. Dropping </p><p>his feet he proceeded to climb the path on all fours, </p><p>his feet first and his prehensile toes grasping every </p><p>projection and bit of rock to draw him along while </p><p>his immense, powerful hands supported his weight </p><p>and pushed him onward, He looked more like a </p><p>gigantic spider than anything, and not in the least </p><p>human. Panting and blown I at last gained the sum- </p><p>AMAZING STORIfiS </p><p>mit and looked down upon a lake of dismal black </p><p>water filling a circular crater about half a mile in </p><p>diameter. Close by was an aperture in the rock </p><p>and half-filled with water, and it was evident that </p><p>this was connected with the outlet below by means </p><p>of a shaft. Whether this was a natural formation </p><p>or had been laboriously cut by hand I could not tell, </p><p>but I was prepared for almost anything by this </p><p>time and was not greatly surprised to find a clever- </p><p>ly constructed sluice gate arranged above the open- </p><p>ing to regulate the flow of water. I had seen similar </p><p>crater lakes in the extinct volcanoes of the West </p><p>Indies, but I was surprised that Hazen had not </p><p>mentioned it. But on second thought I realized </p><p>that when flying over it, the dark water surrounded </p><p>by vegetation would hardly be visible and might </p><p>easily be mistaken for heavy shadow or an empty </p><p>crater, while the aviator’s surprise at the city would </p><p>fix his attention upon it to the exclusion of all </p><p>surroundings. </p><p> Standing upon the rock ridge several hundred</p><p>feet above the city I had almost the same view as </p><p>Hazen had from his plane and I could understand </p><p>how, at an elevation of 5000 feet or more, he </p><p>had been unable to obtain any very accurate idea </p><p>of the buildings or people. I also realized, with a </p><p>sinking of my heart, that it would be next to im- </p><p>possible for him to recognize me or to see any </p><p>signals I might make. </p><p> The most prominent spot in the entire valley</p><p>was the pyramid, for this was isolated upon the </p><p>green plain and the sun, striking through a gap </p><p>in the eastern rim of the crater, shone directly upon </p><p>the altar’s summit, thus bringing it out in sharp </p><p>relief. Indeed, it looked for all the world like a </p><p>pylon on an aviation field. If I expected to make </p><p>my presence known to Hazen or to signal to him, </p><p>my best point of vantage would be the summit of </p><p>the pyramid and I determined to climb there and </p><p>await his arrival when he should be due, two days </p><p>later. </p><p> Little did I dream at the time of the conditions</p><p>under which I would await him upon that gruesome </p><p>altar. </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>The Sacrifice </p><p>BY the time we had descended the mountain </p><p>and had reached the city it was noon, and </p><p>going to my quarters I was glad to find an </p><p>excellent meal. Having finished eating I threw </p><p>myself into the hammock and despite my scarcity</p><p>of matches and tobacco, indulged in a smoke. Then, </p><p>feeling drowsy, I took off my coat, placed it on the </p><p>floor beside my hammock and closed my eyes. </p><p> I awoke refreshed and reached for my coat only</p><p>to leap from the hammock with a cry of alarm. The </p><p>coat was gone! Quickly I searched the room, think- </p><p>ing Zip might have placed the garment elsewhere </p><p>while I slept, but the place was bare. Zip was no- </p><p>where to be seen, and even the rug on which meals </p><p>were served had been removed. </p><p> Here was a pretty state of affairs. My coat con-</p><p>tained my matches, pipe, tobacco, pocket knife and </p><p>handkerchief. Without it I was lost, helpless, in- </p><p>capable of maintaining my prestige of position. </p><p>Death or worse hovered over me. My life depended </p><p>on regaining my precious garment and its contents. </p><p>Who could have taken it? What could have been </p><p>their object? And instantly the truth flashed upon </p><p>my mini It was that rascally high priest. He had </p><p>seen me take pipe, tobacco and matches from my </p><p>coat pocket. He had watched me narrowly, perhaps </p><p>had kept his eyes upon me through some hidden </p><p>peep-hole or opening, and had seen me remove my </p><p>coat, and while I slept had seized it. Or perhaps </p><p>he had ordered Zip to secure it for him. It made </p><p>little difference which, for if it were in his posses- </p><p>sion he would have me in his power. He could order </p><p>me to smoke and when I failed he could perform </p><p>the miracle himself and denounce me as an im- </p><p>poster. My only hope was to regain my possessions </p><p>by fair means or foul, and knowing that every sec- </p><p>ond I delayed increased my peril, I rushed to the </p><p>ladder and across the roofs to the throne room. </p><p> From beneath me, as I started to descend, came</p><p>the sounds of the hissing language in excited tones, </p><p>and as my head came below the level of the roof </p><p>my heart sank. The dark air of the room was heavy </p><p>with tobacco smoke! </p><p> The next instant my feet were jerked from be-</p><p>neath me, I was seized, tumbled on the floor, and </p><p>before I could strike or rise I was bound hand and </p><p>foot. Dazed, startled and helpless I glanced about. </p><p>Surrounding me were a dozen of the repulsive </p><p>dwarfs. Gathered about the sides of the room </p><p>were crowds of people, and seated upon the throne, </p><p>puffing great clouds of smoke from my pipe, a </p><p>wicked leer upon his ugly face, and thoroughly </p><p>enjoying himself, was the priest, while beside him </p><p>the king coughed and sneezed and looked very miser- </p><p>able. </p><p> All this I took in at a glance. Then I was seized</p><p>and dragged roughly before the throne. I fully</p><p>realized my doom was sealed. I was no longer a </p><p>supernatural being to be feared and adored—my </p><p>treatment proved that—but merely a prisoner, an </p><p>ordinary mortal. Oddly enough, however, I was no </p><p>longer frightened. My first fears had given place </p><p>to anger, and I raged and fumed and prayed that </p><p>the grinning fiend before me might be stricken </p><p>with all the torturing sickness, which usually fol- </p><p>lows the beginner’s first smoke. </p><p> But apparently he was immune to the effects, and</p><p>as soon as I was dragged before the throne he rose, </p><p>and pointing at me, addressed the crowd before him. </p><p>That he was denouncing me as an imposter and at </p><p>the same time tremendously increasing his own </p><p>importance was evident by his tones, his gestures </p><p>and the expression on his black face. Moreover, he </p><p>had another card to play. Pointing upward and </p><p>waving his arm and making quite creditable imita- </p><p>tion of an airplane’s exhaust, he spoke vehemently </p><p>and then pointed to a man who crouched on the </p><p>dais. </p><p> At first I was at a loss to grasp his meaning, and</p><p>then, as the trembling creature beside the throne </p><p>spoke in frightened tones and gesticulated vividly, I </p><p>realized he was the chap I had bumped into upon my </p><p>arrival. He had spilled the beans and had informed </p><p>THROUGH THE </p><p>the old scarecrow of a priest that I had arrived via </p><p>the tunnel and not from the sky. </p><p> I felt sure now that my doom was sealed. But</p><p>there was nothing I could do or say. There was </p><p>one chance in a million that I might be escorted </p><p>from the valley and turned loose in the tunnel; but </p><p>that gave me no comfort, for I knew that hideous </p><p>certain death awaited me on that slope covered with </p><p>the devilish man-eating-trees. </p><p> The chances, however, were, all in favor of my</p><p>being tortured and butchered. Strangely enough my </p><p>greatest regret, the matter which troubled me the </p><p>most and made me curse my carelessness in remov- </p><p>ing my coat while I slept, was not that I should </p><p>be killed—I had faced death too often for that—but </p><p>the fact that I would be unable to report the wonder- </p><p>ful discoveries I had made or give my knowledge of </p><p>the city and its people to the world. Indeed, my </p><p>thoughts were so concentrated on this that I gave </p><p>little attention to the priest, until he stepped for- </p><p>ward, and, with a nasty grimace, struck me savage- </p><p>ly across the face. Maddened at the blow I lunged </p><p>forward like a butting ram. My head struck square- </p><p>ly in the pit of his stomach, and with a gasping </p><p>yell he doubled up and fell sprawling on the dais </p><p>while the pipe flew from his lips and scattered its </p><p>contents far and near. Before I could roll to one </p><p>side, my‘guards seized and pulled me across the </p><p>room. Despite my plight and the fate in store </p><p>for me I laughed loudly and heartily as I saw the </p><p>priest with hands pressed to stomach, eyes rolling </p><p>wildly and a sickly greenish pallor on his face. The </p><p>blow plus the tobacco had done its work. I had </p><p>evened up the score a bit at any rate. </p><p> The next moment I was hauled through a low</p><p>doorway hidden by 'draperies, and, bumping like </p><p>a bag of meal over the rough stones, was pitched in- </p><p>to an inky black cell,- Bruised, scratched and1 </p><p>bleeding I lay there unable to move or see while </p><p>the occasional sounds of shuffling footsteps, or </p><p>rather handsteps, told me a guard was close at hand. </p><p>For hour after hour I lay motionless, expecting each </p><p>minute that I would be dragged out to torture or </p><p>death and wondering dully what form it would take, </p><p>until at last—numb, exhausted and worn out, I lost </p><p>consciousness. </p><p> I was brought to my senses by being seized and</p><p>jerked to a sitting posture, and found the cell il- </p><p>luminated by a spluttering torch, while two of the </p><p>men supported my shoulders and a third held a </p><p>gourd of water to my lips. My throat was parched </p><p>and the liquid was most welcome, and a moment </p><p>later, a fourth man appeared with food. It was evi-</p><p>dent that the priest had no intention of letting me </p><p>die of thirst or starvation, and I wondered why he </p><p>should be so solicitous of my comfort if I were </p><p>doomed to an early death. </p><p> As soon as I had eaten, the guards withdrew, tak-</p><p>ing the torch, and I was once more left in stygian </p><p>blackness with my thoughts. I wondered whether it </p><p>were day or night, but I had no means of judging. </p><p>It had been the middle of the afternoon when I had </p><p>missed my coat, and, reasoning that the food served </p><p>was probably the evening meal, I decided that it was </p><p>now about sundown. In that case I should probably </p><p>be put out of the way the next morning. That </p><p>CRATER’S RIM	817</p><p>would be a full twenty-four hours before Hazen </p><p>was due and I wondered what he would think when </p><p>he saw no sign of me in the valley—whether he </p><p>would surmise that I had not reached the city and </p><p>had been killed by the Kunas, and what he would </p><p>report to my friends in Colon. </p><p> But Colon, friends and Hazen seemed very far</p><p>away as I thought of them there in that black hole </p><p>awaiting death at the hands of the strange black </p><p>dwarfs and, as far as any aid they could give me, </p><p>was concerned I might as well have been in Mars. </p><p> My thoughts were interrupted by my guards reap-</p><p>pearing with the torch. Lifting me to my feet they </p><p>loosened the bonds about my legs and urged me </p><p>through a small doorway, where I was compelled to </p><p>bend low to pass, and along a winding, narrow, low- </p><p>ceilinged stone tunnel. That I was on my way to </p><p>my execution I was sure, and vague thoughts of </p><p>selling my life dearly and of overpowering my </p><p>puny guards crossed my mind. But I dismissed </p><p>such ideas as useless, for even were I to succeed I </p><p>would be no better off. There were thousands of the </p><p>tiny men in the city, it was impossible to escape </p><p>from the valley unseen, and I had not the least idea </p><p>where the underground passage led. To attempt to </p><p>escape meant certain death, and there still remained </p><p>a faint chance, a dim hope that I might yet be </p><p>spared and merely deported. So, ducking my head </p><p>and with stooping shoulders, I picked ray way along </p><p>the tunnel by the fitful glare of the flaming torch. </p><p> For what seemed miles the way led on and I</p><p>began to think that the entrance was outside the </p><p>valley and that I was being led to freedom, when </p><p>a glimmer of light showed ahead, the floor sloped </p><p>upward, and, an instant later, I emerged in the open </p><p>air. </p><p> For a moment my eyes were blinded by the light</p><p>after the darkness of the passage and I could not </p><p>grasp where I was. I had thought it evening, but </p><p>my first glance told me it was early morning and </p><p>I knew the night had passed and another day had </p><p>come. Then, as I looked about at my surroundings </p><p>and it dawned upon me where I was, a shudder of </p><p>horror, a chill of deadly fear swept over me. I was </p><p>on the summit of the pyramid. The sacrificial altar </p><p>was within three paces. Beside it stood the fiendish </p><p>priest and his assistants, and gathered upon the </p><p>green plain were hordes of people with faces up- </p><p>turned towards me. I was about to be sacrificed, </p><p>to be bound fast to the bloodstained awful stone, </p><p>to have my still-beating heart torn from my living </p><p>body! </p><p> Anything were preferable to that and with a</p><p>sudden bound I strove to gain the altar's edge and </p><p>hurl myself to certain death. But to no avail. Two </p><p>of the dwarfs held me fast by the cord which fast- </p><p>ened my wrists and I was jerked back to fall heavily </p><p>upon the stones. Before I could struggle up, four </p><p>of the priest’s assistants sprang forward and, grasp </p><p>ing me by legs and shoulders, lifted me and tossed </p><p>me upon the stinking sacrificial stone. I was help- </p><p>less, and instantly my ankles were tied fast to the </p><p>metal staples, the bonds of my wrists were severed, </p><p>my arms were drawn apart and securely lashed to </p><p>other staples, the stone collar was placed about my </p><p>neck forcing my head far back and I was ready </p><p>818 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>for the glowering priest to wreak his awful venge- </p><p>ance. </p><p> Stepping close to the altar he drew a glittering</p><p>obsidian knife—and even in my terrible predica- </p><p>ment I noted this, and realized that he was adhering </p><p>strictly to Aztec customs—and, raising his arms, </p><p>he began a wailing, blood-curdling chant. Up </p><p>from the thousands of throats below came the chant- </p><p>ing chorus, rising and falling like a great wave </p><p>of sound. How long I wondered, would this keep </p><p>on? How much longer must this agony, this tor- </p><p>ture of suspense be borne? Why did he not strike </p><p>his stone dagger into my chest and have it over </p><p>with? </p><p> And then, from some dormant cell in my brain,</p><p>came the answer. I was to be sacrificed to the sun </p><p>god, and I remembered that, according to the Aztec </p><p>religion, the blow could not be struck until the ris- </p><p>ing sun cast its rays upon the victim’s chest above </p><p>the heart. The priest was awaiting that moment. </p><p>He was delaying until the sun, still behind the </p><p>crater’s rim, should throw its first rays upon me. </p><p> How long would it be? How many minutes must</p><p>pass before the fatal finger of light pointed to my </p><p>heart? With a mighty effort I turned my head </p><p>slightly towards the east. Above the rugged moun- </p><p>tain edge was a blaze of light. Even as I looked </p><p>with aching eyes a golden beam shot across the </p><p>valley and flashed blindingly into my face. It was </p><p>now only a matter of seconds. The priest raised his </p><p>knife aloft. The chant from the multitude ceased </p><p>and over city and valley fell an ominous, awful </p><p>silence. Upon the sacrificial knife the sun gleamed </p><p>brilliantly, transforming the glass-like stoae to </p><p>burnished gold. With his free hand the priest tore </p><p>open my shirt and bared my bosom. I felt that the </p><p>end had come. I closed my eyes. And then, at the </p><p>very instant when the knife was about to sweep </p><p>down, faint and far away, like the humming of a </p><p>giant bee, I caught a sound. It was unmistakable </p><p>unlike anything else in all the world—the exhaust </p><p>of an airplane’s engines! </p><p> And my straining ears were not the only ones</p><p>that heard that note. Over the priest’s faee swept </p><p>a look of deadly fear. The poised knife was slowly </p><p>lowered. He turned trembling towards the west </p><p>and from the waiting throng below rose a mighty </p><p>sigh of terror. </p><p> A new hope sprang up in my breast. Was it</p><p>Hazen? He was not due until the next day and it</p><p>might be only some army plane that would pass far </p><p>to one side of the valley. No, the sound was in- </p><p>creasing, the plane was approaching. But even </p><p>were it Hazen would it help me any? Would he see </p><p>my plight and descend or would he fly too far above </p><p>the city to note what was taking place? For a space </p><p>my life was saved. The fear of that giant, roaring </p><p>bird would prevent the sacrifice. The priest feared </p><p>' he had made a mistake, that I urns a god, that, from </p><p>the sky, vengeance would swoop upon him and his </p><p>people for the contemplated butchery. But if the </p><p>plane passed? Or would his dread of it be greater </p><p>than his fear of defying the sun god by failing in </p><p>the sacrifice? </p><p> Now the roar of the motor Bounded direetly over-</p><p>head and the next moment I glimpsed the plane </p><p>speeding across the blue morning sky. Then it was </p><p>gone. The exhaust grew fainter and fainter. All </p><p>hope was lost. Whoever it was had flown on, all un- </p><p>suspecting the awful fate of a fellow man upon that </p><p>sunlit pyramid. </p><p> And now the priest was again towering over me.</p><p>Once more he raised his knife. I could feel the </p><p>warm sun beating upon my throat and shoulders. </p><p>I could feel it creeping slowly but surely down- </p><p>ward. The knife quivered in the impatient hand of </p><p>the priest, I saw his muscles tense themselves for </p><p>the blow, I caught the grim smile that flitted across </p><p>his face as he prepared to strike. </p><p> An instant more and my palpitating heart would</p><p>be held aloft for all to see. </p><p> But the blow never fell. With a deafening roar,</p><p>that drowned the mighty shout of terror from the </p><p>people, the airplane swooped like an eagle from the </p><p>sky and clove the air within a hundred feet of the </p><p>altar. With a gurgling cry the priest flung himself </p><p>face down, and his knife fell clattering with the </p><p>sound of broken glass upon the stones. </p><p> Was it Hazen? Would he see me? Would he</p><p>alight? Was I saved? </p><p> The answer was a thunderous, fear maddened cry</p><p>from below, a swishing whirr as of a gale of wind </p><p>and a dark shadow sweeping over me. </p><p> And then my overwrought senses, my frazzled</p><p>nerves could stand no more and all went black be- </p><p>fore my eyes. </p><p> Dimly consciousness came back. I heard the</p><p>sounds of rushing feet, the panting labored breaths </p><p>of men, sharp, half uttered exclamations and</p><p>grunting noises. Then a shrill scream of mortal </p><p>terror and a deep drawn sigh of relief. Above my </p><p>wondering eyes a figure suddenly loomed. A weird </p><p>uncanny figure with strangely smooth and rounded </p><p>head and great goggling, glassy eyes. With a jerk </p><p>the stone collar was lifted from my strained neck </p><p>and as full consciousness came back I gasped. It </p><p>was Hazen! By some miracle he was ahead of time! </p><p> From somewhere, muffled behind that grotesque</p><p>mask, came a hoarse: “My God, are you hurt?” </p><p> Before I could speak the bonds were slashed</p><p>from my ankles and wrists. A strong arm raised </p><p>me and pulled me from the slab. </p><p> “For God’s sake, hurry!” cried Hazen, as half</p><p>supporting me he rushed toward the altar stairs. </p><p>“I’ve got ’em buffaloed for a minute, but the Lord </p><p>alone knows how long it’ll hold ’em.” </p><p> Rapidly as my numbed limbs would permit I</p><p>rushed down the sloping, spiral way. Half carried </p><p>by Hazen I raced across the few yards of grass </p><p>between the base of the pyramid and the plane, and </p><p>as I did so I caught a fleeting glimpse of a hud- </p><p>dled, shapeless, bloodly bundle of green and white. </p><p>It was all that remained of the priest whom Hazen </p><p>had hurled from the altar top! </p><p> The next moment I was in the plane and Hazen</p><p>was twirling the propeller. There was a roar as </p><p>the motor started. Hazen leaped like an acrobat </p><p>to his seat and slowly the machine moved across </p><p>the plain. </p><p> Everywhere the people we«e prostrate, but as</p><p>the machine started forward one after another </p><p>glanced up. Ere we had traveled a score of yards </p><p>THROUGH THE CRATER’S RIM </p><p>819 </p><p>the creatures were rising and with frightful screams </p><p>were scattering from our pathway. It was impos- </p><p>sible to avoid them. With sickening shocks the </p><p>whirring propeller struck one after another. Blood </p><p>spattered our faces and becrimsoned the windshield </p><p>and the wings. But uninjured the plane gathered </p><p>headway; the uneven bumping over the ground </p><p>ceased; we were traveling smoothly, lifting from </p><p>the earth. </p><p> Then with a strange wild roar the people rushed</p><p>for us. Racing on their hands they came. Rocks </p><p>and missiles whizzed about us. An arrow whirred </p><p>by my head and struck quivering in a strut. But </p><p>now we were rising rapidly. We were looking down </p><p>upon the maddened hosts, their arrows and sling- </p><p>flung stones were striking the under surface of the </p><p>fuselage and wings. We were safe at last. A mo- </p><p>ment more and we would be above the crater rim. </p><p> A sudden exclamation from Hazen startled me.</p><p>I glanced up. Straight ahead rose the precipitous </p><p>mountain side above the quarry. To clear it we </p><p>must ascend far more rapidly than we were doing. </p><p> “Must have splintered the blades!" jerked out</p><p>Hazen. “She’s not making it. Can’t swing her. </p><p>Rudder’s jammed. Heave out everything you can </p><p>find. Hurry or we’ll smash!” </p><p> Before us loomed the ragged, rocky wall. We</p><p>were rushing to our doom at lightning speed. At </p><p>Hazen’s words I grasped whatever I could find and </p><p>tossed it over the side. A box of provisions, a roll </p><p>of tools, a leather jacket, a thermos bottle, canteens, </p><p>an automatic pistol and a cartridge belt all went. </p><p>I glanced up. We were rising faster. A few </p><p>pounds more overboard, a few feet higher and we </p><p>would be clear. Was there anything else I could </p><p>throw out? Frantically I searched. I saw a can- </p><p>like object resting on a frame. Spare gasoline I </p><p>decided, but fuel was of no value now. With an </p><p>effort I dragged it out. I lifted it and hurled it </p><p>over. </p><p> With a sudden jerk the plane sprung upward.</p><p>There was a terrific muffled roar from below and </p><p>with barely a yard to spare we rose above the </p><p>crater rim. </p><p> “Lord, you must have dropped that old bomb!”</p><p>cried Hazen. “The concussion jarred the rudder </p><p>free." </p><p>The </p><p> I glanced over the side. Far beneath, a cloud of</p><p> smoke and dust was drifting slowly aside exposing</p><p> the aqueduct, broken, smashed and in ruins. FroM</p><p> the opening in the mountain side a mighty stream</p><p> of water was roaring in a rushing, tearing torrent.</p><p> The bomb had landed squarely in the quarry. The</p><p> aqueduct had fallen, the shock had let loose the</p><p> gates of the lake and the whole vast crater re-</p><p> servoir was pouring in a mighty flood across the</p><p> valley.</p><p> In a wide arc Hazen swung the plane about.</p><p> “Poor devils!” he muttered as we soared above the</p><p> doomed city.</p><p> Already the green plain was shimmering with</p><p> the glint of water. We could see the frantic, fren-</p><p> zied people running and scrambling up their lad-</p><p> ders. Again we wheeled and circled far above them</p><p> and now only the roof tops of the houses were</p><p> above the flood. Presently these too sank from sight</p><p> and above the sunlit waters only the sacrificial</p><p> stone remained.</p><p> “It’s all over!” exclaimed Hazen, and heading</p><p> northward we sped beyond the encircling mountain</p><p> sides.</p><p> Beneath us now was forest, and with a shudder</p><p> I recognized it as that death-dealing, nightmare</p><p> grove of cannibal trees. Fascinated I gazed down</p><p> and suddenly from the mountain side behind us</p><p> burst a frothing yellow torrent. The pressure of</p><p> the flood had been too great. The overwhelming</p><p> waters had forced the stone door of the tunnel by</p><p> which I had entered that incredible valley. Before</p><p> my wondering eyes the devastating deluge swept</p><p> down the slope. I saw the monstrous trees shiver</p><p> and sway and crash before the irresistible force.</p><p> They gave way and like matchsticks went tossing,</p><p> tumbling, bobbing down the hillside.</p><p> Higher and higher we rose. The water-filled</p><p> crater was now but a silvery lake. The slope up</p><p> which I had fought and raced from the ravenous,</p><p> blood-sucking trees was bare, red earth scarred</p><p> deep by the plunging stream that flowed over it.</p><p> Far to the west gleamed the blue Pacific. Like a</p><p> vast map Darien was spread below us. Northward</p><p> we sped. Before us was civilization. Behind us</p><p> death and destruction. The man-eating trees were</p><p> a thing of the past. The lost city was lost forever.</p><p> End</p><p>NEXT MONTH </p><p>“THE MAN WHO COULD VANISH” </p><p>By A. Hyatt Verrill </p><p> This is without a doubt the best story on man-made invisibility that has ever been</p><p>presented. Suppose we suddenly could make ourselves totally invisible. What would </p><p>happen? And how can it be accomplished? And is it possible to ever devise means </p><p>whereby it can be effected? Personally, we believe it can, and in this story, Mr. Verrill </p><p>gives us excellent science ol how it will be done. But the story contains not only good </p><p>science but gives us a real insight into what will happen when we finally do it. Don’t </p><p>miss it! </p><p> Jffie LORD eftheWmS</p><p>^ JSycAucjustoRissm v </p><p>He was lifted bodily from the ground as if he had been a rag, and blown along with such violence that his body struck the wall of the </p><p>stone house with terrific impact. </p><p>THE LORD OF THE WINDS </p><p>821 </p><p>A Puzzling Companion </p><p>companion had three peculiarities that </p><p>puzzled me. The first was the sharp </p><p>contrast between his refined manners </p><p>and his shabby outfit, which made me </p><p>suspect he was not an ordinary prospec- </p><p>tor any more than I, although he surely seemed to </p><p>feel more comfortable in those clothes and in such </p><p>a place. It entered my mind that his disguise had </p><p>the same purpose as mine—and that we were both </p><p>engaged in the same adventure. Such a possibility </p><p>both amused and irritated me. </p><p> I watched him swinging from one side of the</p><p>saddle to the other, as his horse, just ahead of mine, </p><p>cautiously went down the dangerous slope. </p><p> His second peculiarity was the sack bound to his</p><p>back. This sack was small but heavy, as I judged </p><p>from the effort he displayed, now and then, in ar- </p><p>ranging it on his shoulders. What puzzled me was </p><p>the fact that he carried this burden on his back, </p><p>when he could easily have tied it to the saddle. </p><p> His third peculiarity, which had been first to</p><p>strike me, was his remarkably long upper lip. I was </p><p>sure I had seen that gorilla lip once before. But </p><p>where and when? </p><p> We had met a couple of miles from Rhyolite.</p><p>There I had exchanged my automobile for a horse— </p><p>not because a motor car would have failed to travel </p><p>the sixteen miles of Boundary Canyon, from the </p><p>summit of the Funeral Range down to the Desert </p><p>Valley, but because a horse was more suitable to </p><p>my disguise. Finding that we were bound to the </p><p>same place, we had agreed to travel together. </p><p> When we reached “Hole-in-the-Rock,” a little</p><p>spring making its way out of the Canyon, we dis- </p><p>mounted to water the horses and refill our canteens. </p><p>Then we sat down to rest awhile on a malapais </p><p>boulder shaded by a giant cactus. </p><p> &lt;rWe’ve been riding two</p><p>hours,” he said, looking at </p><p>his watch. </p><p>An Old Acquaintance </p><p>HIS watch had a fob, </p><p>and the fob carried a </p><p>pendant with the emblem </p><p>of a fraternal lodge.</p><p> There flashed across my</p><p>memory a name. </p><p>“Is your name Wells?” </p><p>I asked. </p><p> “Yes,” he answered in</p><p>amazement. “How do you </p><p>know?” </p><p> “Three years ago I went</p><p>for a week from San Francisco to Los Angeles. One </p><p>night I visited your lodge. You were one of the </p><p>two appointed to examine my credentials and give </p><p>me the ritual examination before I could gain en- </p><p>trance.” </p><p>“You are right”; and he shook my hand cordially. </p><p> As soon as he was satisfied that he could trust</p><p>me, Wells became so communicative that his bag </p><p>ceased to be a mystery. He said with a smile: </p><p> “If I had told you that I was a prospector, a gold</p><p>hunter, when you saw me in my evening dress at the </p><p>lodge, you would have doubted me.” </p><p> "It is true, my idea of a miner is somewhat dif-</p><p>ferent.” </p><p> "Well,” he explained, “mining for me is a sport,</p><p>a hobby, a passion. California has gold in every </p><p>hill, once a man gets a glance at the yellow stuff in </p><p>the bottom of the pan, he is a miner for life. The </p><p>gold mania gets more of a grip on the mind than </p><p>does alcohol or morphine.” </p><p> “At times I’d return to the city—to the real estate</p><p>business; but presently my old passion would master </p><p>me. Again I would find myself roaming in these </p><p>mountains, searching, thinking, hoping, dreaming </p><p>nothing but gold, gold, gold. But this time, thank </p><p>God, I can quit for good.” </p><p> “Lost your courage?”</p><p> “No, I made a find.”</p><p> “Gold vein?”</p><p> “No, gems—rubies—just look!”</p><p>A Bag-Full of Great Rubies </p><p>HE unstrapped his bag from his shoulders, placed </p><p>it on his lap, and opened it, showing the con-</p><p>tents. I saw a quantity of stones, both large and </p><p>small. Wells picked out two of the largest stones, </p><p>each as big as an egg. </p><p> “You see these? These two alone may be worth</p><p>$100,000. Altogether in this bag, I think I have </p><p>more than $400,000.” </p><p> “Is that possible?” I returned, with an accent</p><p>that betrayed my skepticism. </p><p> “Do you know anything about gems?” he asked.</p><p> I confessed that I did not.</p><p> “Well, I do, and rubies are rarer than diamonds.</p><p>The largest imported into this country do not reach </p><p>the size of the smallest one in this bag. </p><p> “Of course, when they are faceted and polished,</p><p>they will be much more brilliant. But look at this </p><p>one aS it is.” He held a large stone against the light, </p><p>close to my eyes. “You </p><p>will never find other </p><p>rubies so transparent and </p><p>of a red so rich.” </p><p>-I expressed my admira- </p><p>tion. “And you said the </p><p>value of this collection </p><p>is—?” </p><p> “At least $400,000.</p><p>Maybe twice as much— </p><p>this sack contains my for- </p><p>tune.” </p><p> “But why do you carry</p><p>it on your shoulders? It </p><p>must be heavy.” </p><p>' “Heavy! Say, did you </p><p>ever hear a mother say </p><p>her baby was heavy? I love to feel the weight </p><p>against my back. Besides it is safer. This bag </p><p>has not left my shoulders for three days, not even </p><p>during my sleep, and it shan’t until I reach my home </p><p>in Los Angeles.” </p><p> But you are going in a quite different direction.”</p><p> "I am doing that to see Professor Matheson.”</p><p> “The Lord of the Winds?”</p><p> “That’s what they call him.

Why?”</p><p> “Since you have trusted me by showing your</p><p>treasure, I will tell you my secret. I am only dis- </p><p>guised as a prospector.” </p><p> “I knew it,” Wells rejoined laughing.</p><p>A Newspaper Man Disguised </p><p>i fT’M a newspaper man, working for the San Fran- </p><p>J. cisco Tribune, on my way to get an interview </p><p>with Professor Matheson.” </p><p> “You might as well say that you are going to</p><p>interview your horse.” </p><p> “I know it. No reporter ever got a word from</p><p>him, and for these last six months no reporter has </p><p>been able even to approach him.” </p><p> “Do you blame him, after they have all called him</p><p>a lunatic?” </p><p> “The press of this country was in his favor till</p><p>Sir Oliver Lodge in London, and Professor Brillouin </p><p>in Paris, almost at the same time declared that </p><p>Matheson’s theories were wrong.” </p><p> “I stake my rubies he is not.”</p><p> “Perhaps not, but you will agree with me that</p><p>Matheson’s claims are of such stupendous magni- </p><p>tude as to stagger the wildest imagination.” </p><p>“Yes, but that's no reason why he should be </p><p>ridiculed. They should wait at least until the ex- </p><p>periments are over.” </p><p> “Well, some papers take his side, my paper for</p><p>instance. But nevertheless, when one of our editors </p><p>tried to have a talk with him, all he could get from </p><p>him was: “Facts will convince more than words.” </p><p>So, when it became known that the experiments were </p><p>going to start in a few days, I asked leave to attempt </p><p>the impossible—to interview the unapproachable </p><p>Matheson. The interest of the public is intense. </p><p>But, to tell you the truth, I have no definite plans </p><p>of attack. I am just relying on luck.” </p><p> “You can rely on me,” Wells promised, smiling.</p><p>Mounting our horses, we continued our descent</p><p>into the canyon. The sun had set, a dark orange </p><p>disc in a sea of pulverized gold. In the narrow strip </p><p>of skies that the deep canyon permitted me to see, </p><p>some stars began to twinkle, and the summits of the </p><p>high cliffs, in shadowy outline, assumed fantastic </p><p>shapes. </p><p> “What is your scheme?” I inquired, keeping my</p><p>horse close to Wells. </p><p> “A very simple one—you are my partner. We</p><p>found the treasure together and come to him together </p><p>for advice. I will make him talk about his inven- </p><p>tion also, and you will listen and note.” </p><p> “Every word of the conversation to-morrow will</p><p>be wired to my paper. Meanwhile I wish you would </p><p>tell me all you know about him.” </p><p> A Wonderful Project and Its Creator</p><p>cct DOUBT,” Wells said, “if I know more than </p><p>-i has already been published In the papers. </p><p>They have even printed his picture several times, </p><p>but it does not look like him. Yon must see that </p><p>iittle fellow’s eyes, like electric sparks, brilliant, rest- </p><p>less and Irresistible. He must be fifty, but there </p><p>are times when he looks twenty-five. I happened </p><p>to be there two months ago, when his three hundred </p><p>men were erecting the steel towers that you will see </p><p>as we reach the Desert Valley. You should have </p><p>seen him. I doubt if he weighs 130 pounds, whisk- </p><p>ers and all; but he showed the energy of a giant. </p><p>He was everywhere, giving commands like a general. </p><p>And when you see what has been done there in less </p><p>than a year, you will marvel at the prodigy of that </p><p>wizard.” </p><p> “He must have overcome great difficulties.”</p><p>“Great? Look at this road, if we may call it that. </p><p>Over it Matheson had sixteen motor trucks going </p><p>back and forth from Rhyolite to Wind City, as they </p><p>call his works in the valley. He transported more </p><p>than three thousand tons of steel bars, seventy-five </p><p>tons of cement, two tons of copper wire, lumber for </p><p>twenty-five bungalows, provisions and tools, a thou- </p><p>sand other things. Then he had a water pipe laid </p><p>from the Ermite Mine to Windville.” </p><p> “But why did he come to this forsaken place, so</p><p>difficult to reach?” </p><p> “I never asked him, but I imagine he needed a</p><p>place where the air would be still for long periods </p><p>of time, also perhaps a region quite deserted” </p><p>“Imagine the expense!” </p><p> “I’ve heard there are more than two million dol-</p><p>lars invested in this—which is but an experiment in </p><p>diminutive proportions.” </p><p> “Two million dollars for an experiment is a proof</p><p>of strong faith on the part of the stockholders.” </p><p>“There are no stockholders,” Wells declared. “One </p><p>man has financed Matheson—a multi-millionaire.” </p><p> “I surely remember having read of a tremendous</p><p>corporation behind Matheson.” </p><p> “Yes, I understand that if these trials prove the</p><p>soundness of the idea, the largest corporation that </p><p>the world has ever known will invest some billions of </p><p>dollars to put the scheme into action. Enough </p><p>money to buy all the railroad lines and the Panama </p><p>Canal, with plenty left over to buy the United </p><p>States Navy. But they say it will be the best in- </p><p>vestment any country can make. Matheson claims </p><p>he will transform the whole globe, producing more </p><p>real wealth than all the world’s industries.” </p><p> “Don’t forget the opinion of Sir Oliver Lodge and</p><p>the two great meteorologists.” </p><p> “Their skepticism will have an interesting set</p><p>back, I’m sure, before the week is over. Look! </p><p>There is the Ermite Mine.” </p><p> A One-Man Mine and Its Strange Owner</p><p> COULD not see any signs of a camp.</p><p> “Is it really a mine?” I inquii-ed.</p><p> “Yes, a mine that has no equal in the world—a</p><p>one-man mine. You will be interested to see this </p><p>man Davy—the ‘Hermit,’ as they usually call him. </p><p>Tall and massive as one of these boulders, he has </p><p>a neck as large as my horse’s neck, and eyebrows </p><p>so black and thick that you cannot see his eyes. He </p><p>lives alone in his mine, a gold mine that he dis- </p><p>covered six years ago. He operates it himself, with </p><p>only the aid of a mule.” </p><p> “A rich mine?”</p><p> “Very poor ground. He tried to sell it several</p><p>times; nobody would give him enough, so he thought </p><p>that he would exploit it himself. He has been liv- </p><p>ing here these six years, and he has done wonders. </p><p>Should you pass this way in the daytime you would </p><p>see what a lone man can do. He has bored two </p><p>THE LORD OF THE WINDS	823</p><p>tunnels, and constructed a mining plant that crushes </p><p>two tons of rocks daily. Of course, the whole outfit </p><p>is the simplest that one can imagine. Once a month </p><p>he goes to town with his mule, to deposit his little </p><p>treasure and to get provisions for another month.” </p><p> “Does he make much?”</p><p> “Nobody knows; but I’m sure he makes very little</p><p>out of it. He told me once that his idea was to get </p><p>enough money to operate the mine on a larger scale </p><p>with modern machinery; but I wonder how long he </p><p>will have to wait. He is more than fifty now.” </p><p> “And isn’t he afraid of keeping gold in this soli-</p><p>tude?” </p><p> “The Hermit afraid? Wait until you see him!”</p><p> By this time we had left the main road and taken</p><p>to a narrow path at the left of the canyon, which </p><p>ascended a slight hill. When he had gone a hun- </p><p>dred yards, Wells shouted, “Davy,” and stopped his </p><p>horse. He repeated his call. A voice very near us </p><p>answered, “Hello there!” My eye3 spotted the sil- </p><p>houette of a man in front of a hut. </p><p> I remember little of the few minutes that we spent</p><p>in that small, bare, one-room cabin, faintly illumin- </p><p>ated by a sooty lamp. About the man I remember </p><p>only his eyes, the eyes that Wells found hard to </p><p>see under those thick eyebrows. I always scoffed </p><p>at such things as presentment; but those savage, </p><p>rapacious eyes had a sinister meaning to me. </p><p> I remembered afterward that when Wells, in a</p><p>general way, asserted that he had “struck rich,” the </p><p>eyes of the Hermit assumed a strange expression, </p><p>fearful and repulsive. Of this much I was certain </p><p>then: his attention was abnormally attracted by the </p><p>sack on Wells’ back.	/</p><p> The Hermit insisted that we spend the night with</p><p>him, but we declined. </p><p> “Thanks old man,” said Wells. “We must hustle</p><p>along. We have chosen this time of day to escape </p><p>the heat, and expect to reach the valley by nine </p><p>o’clock. My friend will start back by twelve. It </p><p>is moonlight tonight, and by five he will be in </p><p>Rhyolite again. I will sleep in camp in the stone </p><p>house.” </p><p> "Where the machinery is?” inquired the Hermit.</p><p> “Yes; one of the overseers who has his bed there,</p><p>is away tonight.”</p><p> We bade the Hermit good-bye. He did not an-</p><p>swer. </p><p>First View of the Great Station </p><p>HALF an hour later we were out of the canyon. </p><p>The valley appeared before us. The moon was </p><p>high and its glow.inundated the plain, transforming </p><p>it into an ocean of dead calmness. Wells pointed </p><p>toward the north. A tower as slim as the steeple </p><p>of a Gothic Church rose against the sky to a great </p><p>height. </p><p> During my journalistic career, I have had to cover</p><p>many exciting stories, filled with pathos or danger. </p><p>But never have I been so thrilled as when I stopped </p><p>my horse, for a minute, to gaze at that shadowy </p><p>tower. I felt sure that I was going to witness a </p><p>prodigious achievement, which, for its arduousness, </p><p>its gigantic possibilities and its sublimity, had no </p><p>equal in the history of the world. I exulted over </p><p>the opportunity that was so soon to be mine—to </p><p>meet the man who, by the power of his genius, was </p><p>going to transform the earth almost like a God. </p><p> As we came nearer, I 'distinguished other con-</p><p>structions besides the tower. There were five or </p><p>six houses of different shapes and dimensions. One </p><p>of them was lighted. Toward that one Wells went. </p><p>I examined the tower as carefully as I could in the </p><p>scanty light of the moon. It was a skeleton tower </p><p>of steel bars, built on a massive concrete base that </p><p>covered a surface about four hundred feet square. </p><p>Tapering, as the height increased, it ended almost </p><p>in a point, supporting a large sphere, which by the </p><p>way it reflected the rays of the moon, appeared to be </p><p>made of glass. Innumerable wire cables, parting </p><p>from the tower at regular intervals and fastened </p><p>to the ground, insured the stability of the construc- </p><p>tion, which I judged to be fully five hundred feet </p><p>high. </p><p> “Some workl” I exclaimed in admiration.</p><p> “Yes, when you think that they built thirty of</p><p>these spikes in the valley. See another one over </p><p>there?” </p><p> I discerned, a couple of miles away, a narrow</p><p>shadow rising from the flat horizon, brilliant at its </p><p>extremity, like a lighthouse in the ocean. </p><p> We did not need to rap at the door of the one</p><p>story house; it was open, as were all the windows. </p><p>We went in, to find ourselves face to face with Pro- </p><p>fessor Matheson. </p><p> His personality did not lend itself to a picturesque</p><p>description. He had the ordinary appearance of a </p><p>middle aged man, with a calm and cheerful face, as </p><p>if he had never been troubled by any problem. But </p><p>I had not been five minutes in the room before I </p><p>realized that I was in the presence of an extraordi- </p><p>nary man. </p><p> Wells made his introduction as planned, mention-</p><p>ing me as his partner. Then without delay he put </p><p>into the hands of the Professor two of the largest </p><p>gems of his collection. </p><p> Meanwhile I looked around the spacious room,</p><p>illuminated by two electric lights. The confusion, </p><p>the multitude, and the variety of the objects scat- </p><p>tered about made of that place a strange combina- </p><p>tion of library, draughting room, work-shop, mu- </p><p>seum, laboratory and storehouse. A wooden parti- </p><p>tion separated the room from the other part of the </p><p>building, accessible through a large doorway which </p><p>was wide open. Desirous of finding out what the </p><p>next room contained, I gradually reached the door- </p><p>way and looked inside. The place was dark, but the </p><p>moonlight, entering through the open window, al- </p><p>lowed me to see that the floor was covered with </p><p>boxes, all of one dimension three feet long by two </p><p>feet wide, placed six inches apart, and each con- </p><p>nected to the next by wires. The boxes were placed </p><p>in parallel rows, with room enough for a person to </p><p>step between the rows. I figured that there must </p><p>be fully forty boxes in each row—in all more than </p><p>one thousand boxes. I could not see anything else </p><p>in that vast room. </p><p>Examining the Rubies—Explanations of the Project </p><p>MY conjectures did not lead me to any plausible </p><p>explanation of the nature of what I was seeing </p><p>so I turned to the two men, who were still talking </p><p>about the precious stones. </p><p> The Professor was holding one against the bulb</p><p>of the electric light. </p><p>824 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> “These are star rubies,” he said with profound</p><p>conviction. “See the aster ism that is so marked </p><p>in this stone? It is produced by crystals of extreme </p><p>minuteness parallel to the crystalline axis. I know </p><p>of only two other rubies as nearly perfect as this </p><p>one, but they are not so large. One is a Bohemian </p><p>ruby preserved in the imperial treasury at Vienna; </p><p>the other one is in Dresden.” </p><p> “Then you really believe I have something valu-</p><p>able?” asked Wells. </p><p> “Something of a remarkable value, I am sure,"</p><p>said the other adding to the words a vigorous shake </p><p>of his head. </p><p> “Hurrah!” exclaimed Wells, and picked from his</p><p>bag a stone of medium size, which he offered to the </p><p>Professor, who thanked him warmly. </p><p> “I shall be glad to keep it as a rare specimen,”</p><p>he concluded. “And speaking of gems, you will be </p><p>interested in seeing a beautiful tourmaline that one </p><p>of my men found while digging for the foundation </p><p>of the tower.” </p><p> “Where is it?” Wells inquired.</p><p> “In the third building where two of my men</p><p>have made their quarters. I will take you there. </p><p>Very likely they are all in by this time.” And he </p><p>started for the door. </p><p> He had not reached the middle of the room, when</p><p>I inquired with a voice that I strove to make indif- </p><p>ferent, “Would you mind, professor, telling me what </p><p>you keep in that room?” The look that Wells sent </p><p>me clearly indicated that I was guilty of a serious </p><p>imprudence. But the Professor turned his head, </p><p>smiling. </p><p> “Those are the batteries, the electric batteries</p><p>that will furnish the current to the thirty towers.” </p><p> And instead of proceeding toward the door, he</p><p>walked back to the partition, turned a switch, and </p><p>illuminated the second room. I noticed then some- </p><p>thing I had not seen before. That room, besides </p><p>the rows of boxes, contained a very large bench to </p><p>which the wires of the batteries ran, and which had </p><p>a number of electrometers and two very conspicuous </p><p>switches. I noticed also (and this detail had the </p><p>most important bearing on the events that succeeded) </p><p>that the bench ran along the wall, directly under </p><p>the open window.</p><p> “Over there you shift the electric current?” I</p><p>asked. </p><p> “Right,” answered the Professor. And he smiled</p><p>again at my curiosity. </p><p> A hundred questions crowded my mind at once;</p><p>but Wells came to my rescue. Seeing that the Pro- </p><p>fessor was unusually communicative, he thought the </p><p>time was at hand to try the effect of the story he </p><p>had concocted for my benefit. </p><p> "Professor,” he began, endeavoring to make his</p><p>voice sound indifferent. “I wish you would tell my </p><p>friend something about your work. I explained it </p><p>all to him, but I must have done a poor job, because </p><p>he couldn’t make head or tail of my account. You </p><p>can go into details, because he has some education. </p><p>He went to college before the mining bug got him. </p><p>Am I right, Pal?” </p><p> I answered with a nod. I was so anxious about</p><p>the Professor’s reaction that I could not utter a </p><p>word. </p><p> .Wells noticed my confusion. To save the situa-</p><p>tion he added: </p><p>The Project Is Explained by the Inventor </p><p>«/^VF course, there is one thing he has understood </p><p>W —that you are the greatest genius of this and </p><p>of any other generation, and that your invention is </p><p>the most astonishing thing-.” </p><p> “Now, now,” interrupted the Professor, laughing</p><p>at the earnestness of Wells’ enthusiasm. “Let us </p><p>not exaggerate. I have found nothing new; I have </p><p>only applied old and well known discoveries to a </p><p>practical and useful purpose.” Then, addressing </p><p>himself to me, “Young man, do you know much </p><p>about Roentgen rays?” </p><p> Did I know! Before starting on my adventure, I</p><p>had gone through all the books that could enlighten </p><p>me on the subject of Professor Matheson’s inven- </p><p>tion. But I answered hesitatingly. </p><p> “Well, I remember they are produced by an elec-</p><p>trical discharge passed through a tube from which </p><p>the air has been exhausted.” </p><p> “Exactly! Now, I have found a new application</p><p>of these rays. I have found a practical way of elec- </p><p>trifying the air of a vast area with a single tube </p><p>which does not differ much from the one introduced</p><p>by Porter. There is nothing essentially new in my </p><p>invention.” </p><p> “Professor, you are too modest,” interrupted</p><p>Wells. </p><p> “I am telling you the truth, and I can prove it.</p><p>Come over here, and I will show you something.” </p><p>We returned to the front room. The Professor </p><p>directed our attention to two spherical glasses, of </p><p>about six Inches in diameter and four feet apart, </p><p>mounted on pedestals. </p><p> “These are the miniatures of the apparatus that</p><p>I have placed in the towers—nothing but a Porter </p><p>tube, with one or two changes. As you can see, the </p><p>cathode is the same: a segment of a hollow sphere. </p><p>The anti-cathode is also connected with the anode; </p><p>but instead of platinum or tantalum I use a compo- </p><p>sition of my invention which is not affected by the </p><p>extreme heat of the discharge. The tube, instead </p><p>of being exhausted as usual, contains a gaseous sub- </p><p>stance, about which I keep silent. And the common </p><p>induction coil, with a mercery interrupter, produces </p><p>the discharge. The usual ionization of a gas is due </p><p>to the splitting up of 'some' of the atoms of that gas, </p><p>resulting in the detachment of electrons, constituents </p><p>of the atoms. Each electron carries a constant nega- </p><p>tive charge, while the part of the atom that is left </p><p>behaves like a positive ion, with the units charged </p><p>positively, but with a mass that is large compared </p><p>with that of the negative ions. Do you follow me?” </p><p>‘Tes,” I answered, while Wells stared at me to </p><p>find out if I meant it. </p><p> Perhaps my “yes” was not as convincing as it</p><p>could have been. Even the Professor seemed to have </p><p>noticed this. </p><p>The Artificial Production and Control of Winds </p><p>UTT’OU may not be up to date in the recent re- </p><p>X searches in this field,” he resumed. “But I </p><p>can tell you now, in one word, what my application </p><p>is. One of these tubes ionizes the surrounding air, </p><p>and the positive nuclei are attracted by the second </p><p>tube which ionizes the air, not with a smaller but </p><p>with a larger proportion of negative electrons. That </p><p>is absolutely all.” </p><p>THE LORD OF THE WINDS </p><p>825 </p><p> The Professor stopped as if he had finished. I</p><p>looked at him in suspense, and Wells kept staring </p><p>at the Professor and at me with evident confusion. </p><p>At length Wells spoke. </p><p> “But what about the winds ?”</p><p> “Here, place your hand here,” said the inventor,</p><p>holding the hand of the miner at the level of the </p><p>Roentgen tubes, and midway between them. </p><p> The Professor turned a switch on the table. A</p><p>bluish glare appeared in both tubes, sparkling, </p><p>dancing, while the crisp, short discharges sounded </p><p>in rapid succession. Wells pulled out his hand </p><p>brusquely. </p><p> “I feel a breeze,” he exclaimed.</p><p> I placed my hand where he had held hia, and I,</p><p>too, felt a gentle breeze blowing against my palm. </p><p> “It is the air electrified by the tube on the left,</p><p>and violently attracted by the tube on the right,” ex- </p><p>plained the Professor. “Here is the basis of my </p><p>invention.” </p><p> “And the towers you have erected?”</p><p> “They serve to produce this same experiment on</p><p>a larger scale. Each tower supports a Roentgen </p><p>tube large enough to ionize the air within a radius </p><p>of two miles, if my calculations are correct.” </p><p> “And what do you intend to do with them?” I</p><p>asked. </p><p> “I want to try their maximum efficiency. I have</p><p>erected thirty towers in this desert, at two mile </p><p>intervals, covering thus fifty-eight miles, in a </p><p>straight line across the plains.” </p><p> “Is the work all done?”</p><p> “Yes, it was completed a week ago, but we have</p><p>had to delay our test until everything and everybody </p><p>are out of the way. We shall have to demolish all </p><p>the huts we have built for the workmen, all the </p><p>small houses you have seen around here, except this </p><p>one that has been purposely built with massive stone </p><p>walls and low roof. You see, I must take every pre- </p><p>caution, because it is hard to foresee the velocity of </p><p>the wind that will be produced during the trials. In </p><p>a couple of days more, all will be cleared away, and </p><p>all the men and animals will go to a safe place in</p><p>the canyons. I will remain here with Carter, my </p><p>chief engineer and will begin the tests.” </p><p> “Do you need anybody at the towers ?”</p><p> “No, I have absolute control of them from this</p><p>house—from that bench in the next room.” </p><p> We went again into the room of the storage bat-</p><p>teries, and I saw again the bench under the open </p><p>window. </p><p> The Mystery Explained—What Wind Can Do</p><p>CCX7-0U see these switches?” asked the Professor, </p><p>X pointing to the bench. “With these I regu- </p><p>late the discharge to all the towers.” </p><p> “And why are you doing all this?” I asked.</p><p> “To produce wind, of course.”</p><p> “Wind?”</p><p> “Yea.”</p><p> “You don’t expect to sell wind, do you?”</p><p> “I surely do.”</p><p> “God knows there is plenty of free wind in the</p><p>world.” </p><p> “Yes, but not always the kind of wind you want,</p><p>nor when you want it. If the trials I am going </p><p>to start here in a couple of days are successful, as </p><p>I am sure they will be, in five years’ time the whole </p><p>United States will be thickly dotted with my towers, </p><p>in lines that will run in all directions from the </p><p>Atlantic to the Pacific, from Canada to Mexico, in </p><p>innumerable parallel rows that will cover the whole </p><p>country—and eventually will cover all the other con- </p><p>tinents, and the whole globe from the poles to the </p><p>equator.” </p><p> “Just to make wind?”</p><p> “Yes, to produce winds artificially.”</p><p> “For any practical good?”</p><p> “For the greatest good that man ever dreamed,”</p><p>exclaimed the inventor, sweeping the air with both </p><p>extended arms, and smiling triumphantly. Then he </p><p>resumed: "When I succeed in forcing at will a cur- </p><p>rent of air from any place to any place. I shall have </p><p>under my control the winds, and, with the winds, the </p><p>clouds, and, with the clouds, the rain. Do you see</p><p>now? I will regulate the seasons. I will regulate </p><p>the climates. Do you know what that means? It </p><p>means transforming the earth into a veritable para- </p><p>dise. I will make cold regions warm, pumping hot </p><p>winds from the south, and I will make hot places </p><p>cool, sending fresh air from the north. The tem- </p><p>perature "will be made even throughout the year. </p><p>Yuma, in Arizona will not roast any more at 120 </p><p>degrees in the shade, and Havre in Montana will not </p><p>freeze at 48 degrees below zero.” </p><p> “But there is more than temperature. Do you</p><p>know how many people in our country, in the Orient, </p><p>in Africa, some everywhere, suffer unspeakable tor- </p><p>tures for the lack of a little water, and with dried </p><p>throats pray for months for a cloud from the burn- </p><p>ing skies—and when at last the cloud, blessed as a </p><p>deliverer, rises in the horizon, and the rain comes, </p><p>the little water gathered with great care in wells, </p><p>in hides, in vases, hot, muddy, noisome and full of </p><p>microbes, will have to last God knows how long? </p><p>Those people will cease to suffer. A telegram to my </p><p>central meteorologic office will cause me to send them </p><p>from the north all the rain they need,and when they </p><p>have enough, another telegram—and the clouds will </p><p>be pumped back and the skies will be clear again.” </p><p> Weather and Temperature Supplied to Order</p><p>ut’LL tell you what you can do, Professor,” in- </p><p>I terrupted Wells. “In the summer, when the </p><p>people of New York, Chicago, Boston and Philadel- </p><p>phia are prostrated by the heat, you ask them how </p><p>much they will be willing to give you for every nice </p><p>cool day. Do the same when the thermometer is </p><p>going below zero, and you will get your expenses </p><p>back in less than a year, and pile up a fortune </p><p>besides.” </p><p> “There is something in that,” I said. “But, Pro- .</p><p>fessor, have you figured out what will be the coat </p><p>of installing your towers everywhere?” </p><p> “No, not with accuracy; but I estimate that for</p><p>the United States alone it will be necessary to in- </p><p>vest about two billion dollars.” </p><p> “Two thousand millions! It is enormous.”</p><p> “It is; but look here, young man. Do you know</p><p>the amount of farm produce of this country? Eight </p><p>and one-half billion dollars a year. I can double </p><p>that amount. I can more than double the fertility </p><p>of the country. Even considering the land that Is </p><p>now being cultivated, have you an idea of the eco- </p><p>nomic values of a normal season? Last year on </p><p>826 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>account of abnormal weather—with frosts in April, </p><p>and no rain in June and July—the crops were cut </p><p>practically in two, with a tremendous loss. Yes, </p><p>the installation of my towers will require a huge </p><p>capital; but it will pay. It will pay, not in com- </p><p>fort and crops alone, but it will pay in other ways </p><p>besides. When Siberia as well as the Sahara de- </p><p>sert, and Congo as well as Alaska, have perpetual </p><p>spring, and the peoples of the earth find in the </p><p>tilling of the soil, where they were born, a sure, un- </p><p>failing source of wealth, and the differences of </p><p>climates and products are eliminated, we will see </p><p>the disappearance of all the other differences that </p><p>separate nations from nations; and all men, saved </p><p>from famine and strife, will hasten in harmony on </p><p>the road of a glorious progress.” </p><p> “Good I" Wells and I exclaimed.</p><p> ‘‘And at last we shall realize the dream of all</p><p>ages. Wars will be made impossible. All the na- </p><p>tions will have to obey the verdicts of the Interna- </p><p>tional Supreme Court, and no people will dare to </p><p>rebel. They would have to face my wrath. Do </p><p>not smile gentlemen. Think how the winds in my </p><p>hands may become weapons, the most dreadful </p><p>weapons. The gentle breeze, if I choose, may be </p><p>turned into a violent storm, and the beneficent </p><p>rain, if I wish, may become a deluge. Woe to that </p><p>nation that will dare disturb universal peace! I </p><p>will thrust upon them with full force my means of </p><p>destruction, against which whole armies will be </p><p>powerless—the hurricane!” </p><p> “You will be mightier than a king,” I exclaimed.</p><p>The Earth His Kingdom by His Power Over the Air </p><p>ccxrES, because my kingdom, the air, covering </p><p>» X all the kingdoms of the earth, will be as </p><p>vast' as the earth.” </p><p> The inventor said these words calmly, with his</p><p>perpetual smile; but the expression of his eyes re- </p><p>vealed how well he appreciated the full significance </p><p>of that assertion. </p><p> “Are you sure the apparatus will work?” I in-</p><p>quired. </p><p> “I am positive of it. What I am not certain</p><p>about is the degree of power that it will develop. </p><p>You see, the problem consists, not only in originat- </p><p>ing the winds, but also in fighting back the winds </p><p>that, formed by the difference of atmospheric pres-</p><p>sures, may be contrary to my pre-arranged plan. </p><p>We must be able to develop a current strong enough </p><p>to win the strongest winds.” </p><p> “That is to say?”</p><p>“In St. Paul, Minnesota, there has been recorded </p><p>a wind of the velocity of 102 miles an hour, the maxi- </p><p>mum observed in this country. I expect to reach </p><p>and surpass that speed, if everything goes well.” </p><p>“That is a terrific speed,” said Wells. </p><p> “And the effects are in proportion,” added the</p><p>inventor. “The pressure of a hurricane of 100 </p><p>miles an hour is 49,200 pounds per square foot. You </p><p>understand now why I have chosen this desert place </p><p>for my experiments, and why I must wait to begin </p><p>the tests until all the wooden houses built by my </p><p>helpers are demolished, and men and animals sent </p><p>to a safe distance.” </p><p> “Professor,” I ventured with some hesitancy, “I</p><p>had planned to go back tonight; but if you would </p><p>let me, I should like to stay and see your towers </p><p>work.” </p><p> “I have no objections; but I warn you there may</p><p>be some risk, and you must take upon yourself all </p><p>the responsibility.” </p><p> “I will,” I assented with enthusiasm.</p><p> “Now, Professor,” interrupted Wells, “you have</p><p>satisfied my friend’s curiosity; I wish you would </p><p>satisfy mine.” </p><p> “Oh, about the tourmaline that I told you An-</p><p>drews keeps in his cabin?” </p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “Well, let us go there. It is just half past nine.</p><p>Andrews must be in; perhaps he is in bed already.” </p><p> We turned off all the lights and went out. The</p><p>night was balmy, the air still, and the moon high in </p><p>the sky. </p><p> Andrews’ cabin was only fifty to sixty steps from</p><p>the stone house. Nobody was in. </p><p> “I know where he keeps that stone,” said the</p><p>Professor. “Come in gentlemen.” </p><p> We entered. The cabin was not more than nine</p><p>feet square, and the slanting roof was so low that </p><p>I could almost reach it with my outstretched arm.</p><p> As we entered, the Professor proved his fami-</p><p>liarity with the place by finding the electric switch </p><p>in the dark. </p><p> “The powerful batteries we have stored,” he ex-</p><p>plained, “allow us the luxury of a good light. I </p><p>will find the tourmaline for you, Mr. Wells.” </p><p>A Catastrophe—Disaster at Large </p><p>^pHE inventor had scarcely ended his sentence, </p><p>when a sudden roaring noise broke the still- </p><p>ness of the night. The sound clearly resembled the </p><p>coming of a mighty storm. We looked at one an- </p><p>other in great astonishment. The wind was blow- </p><p>ing against the back of the cabin with violence. </p><p>We had to shout at the top of our voices to be </p><p>heard. </p><p> We went to the door, looked outside.</p><p> The Professor pointed into the air. The summit</p><p>of the tower was illuminated. The large glass </p><p>globe was glittering with green and blue sparks. </p><p> I looked at the Professor, and trembled. I had</p><p>never before seen a like expression of stupor and </p><p>dismay. He held his head with both hands—then, </p><p>as if struck by a sudden idea, he made for the open. </p><p>I caught him by his coat, and pulled him back. </p><p> “It is folly to go out,” I yelled; but I could not</p><p>hear my own voice, as the wind, increasing in </p><p>violence, had increased its roaring. </p><p> The Professor, turning quickly, struck me a</p><p>powerful blow in the chest, then freeing his coat </p><p>from my grip, leaped toward the stone house. </p><p> The Inventor Perishes in the Wind of His Creation</p><p>WHAT I had expected happened. The ill-fated </p><p>man had scarcely taken ten steps, when, once </p><p>out of protection of the shielding cabin, he was </p><p>seized by the wind and thrown to the ground. </p><p>There he struggled frantically, while the wind </p><p>rolled, knocked and tossed him. A little farther </p><p>on I saw him stop: perhaps he had succeeded in </p><p>getting hold of some rock protruding from the </p><p>sand. I saw him rising again, and then, (the moon </p><p>was so bright that I could distinguish everything)’ </p><p>he was lifted bodily from the ground, as if he </p><p>THE LORD OF THE WINDS </p><p>827 </p><p>had been a rag, and blown along with such vio- </p><p>lence that his body struck the wall of the stone </p><p>house with a terrific impact. </p><p> I closed my eyes in horror. But presently I real-</p><p>ized the danger that I too was facing. The cabin </p><p>was about to be smashed; the boards were coming </p><p>apart. Evidently Wells shared my fears. </p><p> What were we to do?</p><p> I quickly analyzed the situation. If the towers</p><p>were in action, the electric power of the storage </p><p>batteries must have been turned on by something </p><p>or somebody. The breaking of the current would </p><p>stop that cyclone and save us from destruction. </p><p> But how could we reach the stone house to open</p><p>the switches when a sally from the cabin meant </p><p>sure death? </p><p> As if he had read that fearful question in my</p><p>mind, Wells answered it in an unexpected way. He </p><p>grabbed a rope lying in a corner, and showed it to </p><p>me. To talk was useless; so he acted. First he </p><p>counted the rope by arm lengths. I counted at the </p><p>same time, and figured out that there were fully </p><p>75 yards of strong rope, more than the distance from </p><p>the cabin to the stone house. </p><p> Then with gestures, Wells asked me to tie one</p><p>end of the rope around his body, under his shoul- </p><p>ders, as he could not do it himself, because of his </p><p>inseparable sack of precious gems. To the knots I </p><p>made, Wells added one more, then took the other </p><p>end of the rope, passed it around one of the main </p><p>supporting posts of the hut, pulled until all the </p><p>rope had passed through, and handed it to me. </p><p> His plan was clear. Securely tied he would ven-</p><p>ture outside, and I would let the rope slide easily </p><p>until he could reach the stone house. </p><p> He lay on the ground, face down, and moving</p><p>like a turtle, began his perilous journey. I seated </p><p>myself on the floor, my back to the door, my feet </p><p>against the boards of the wall, my hands holding </p><p>the rope. </p><p>A Ray of Hope But No More </p><p>THIS unexpected chance of salvation gave me </p><p>such joy that I heard no more of the rushing of </p><p>the hurricane, nor the cracking of the cabin: all </p><p>my attention was concentrated on my task of let-</p><p>ting the rope slide out inch by inch. </p><p> Of a sudden there was a tremendous crash, and</p><p>I found myself lying on my back with the moon- </p><p>light shining in my face. The cabin had gone; the </p><p>rope had slipped out of my hands. </p><p> When I recovered from my stupor, I wondered</p><p>at two things—why I had not been hurt when the </p><p>cabin went to pieces and why I was still in the </p><p>same place, not the prey of the devastating wind. </p><p> I explained the first by a mere miracle—and the</p><p>second by looking in the direction of my feet. The </p><p>sand, blown up in great quantity by the wind, had </p><p>gathered against the back of the cabin; and now </p><p>that the cabin was gone, this sand formed a dune, </p><p>nine feet long and two feet high, which shielded me </p><p>from the full force of the hurricane. </p><p> I decided to take a still safer position. Crawling</p><p>on my back, I placed myself lengthwise close to </p><p>the dune. Now I could see the tower and the </p><p>stone house; but of the half dozen huts I saw </p><p>not a sign. </p><p> I was by no means at ease; the shelter was un-</p><p>comfortable, and not fully reassuring, but I could </p><p>do nothing except wait for that inferno to come to </p><p>a stop. </p><p> ‘The batteries will become exhausted sooner or</p><p>later,” I said to myself, “but when? In an hour, </p><p>in a day, or in a week?” </p><p> With horror, I soon discovered the presence of a</p><p>more imminent danger. I should say two dangers, </p><p>one as deadly as the other. I discovez-ed that the </p><p>height of the little hill of sand was gradually be- </p><p>coming lower, and that the time was not far off </p><p>when it would become so low that the wind could </p><p>get its mighty grip on my body. </p><p> I discovered also that the sand carried in large</p><p>clouds by the tornado was accumulating in the hol- </p><p>low where I lay, and threatened to cover me. Of </p><p>course, I was greatly frightened, yet my mind wa3 </p><p>clear, and, strange, as it may sound, I immediately </p><p>began to calculate which of the two deaths would </p><p>get me first—to be buried alive in the sand, or to </p><p>be caught by the wind and smashed against the </p><p>walls of the stone house. I even tried to speculate </p><p>which of the two was less terrible. </p><p> The hurricane now held full sway. It seemed</p><p>that the whole earth was trembling. The roaring </p><p>and shrilling and shrieking lacerated my ears. It </p><p>was like the thundering of a hundred tempests over</p><p>an infuriated ocean, or the crashing of a cataract </p><p>a thousand times larger than Niagara. </p><p> Now and then, I even seemed to distinguish some</p><p>special sounds in that unbelievable noise. Yes, </p><p>there was the discordant dissonance of a million </p><p>violins and 'cellos played in seven different keys, </p><p>and accompanied by a gigantic organ with all the </p><p>pipes wide open. And then it sounded like the </p><p>moaning of infinite herds caught in a forest fire, </p><p>and the screams and groans of distress of all the </p><p>mobs of the world threatened by unavoidable de- </p><p>struction. </p><p>The Wind Bridled and Wreaking Destruction </p><p>BUT above all this, I heard the enraged voices of </p><p>the wind—of the wind that, free since the </p><p>beginning of creation, free to roam over the im- </p><p>mensities of the seas, free to dominate over the </p><p>wild forests, free to speed over the boundless </p><p>deserts and over the mountain peaks, free to come </p><p>and go in the infinite vastness of the earth, was </p><p>feeling now for the first time the touch of the bridle </p><p>suddenly imposed by the genius of man, and with </p><p>desperate convulsions was in vain rebelling against </p><p>that conquering power. </p><p> My God! its revolt was horrible beyond words!</p><p>What was passing above my head? I could not </p><p>be mistaken; those were bodies of men, of horses </p><p>and cattle, some tumbling to the ground and rising </p><p>up again in clouds of sand, then fast disappearing </p><p>from my sight. </p><p> Strange as it may seem, even in the agitation</p><p>of all my nerves, the magnitude and horror of that </p><p>scene brought some verses to my memory. I was </p><p>viewing what Dante saw, in the second Circle of </p><p>the Inferno, while he was witnessing the punish- </p><p>ment of carnal sinners, where: </p><p>(Continued on page 868) </p><p>Pk Telepathic Pick-Up </p><p>** Samuel cM- Sanjent,Jr. ** </p><p>There sounded a wild scream. Dr. Spaulding leaped upon the machine, gibbering incoherently, and smashed the mechanism Into </p><p>thousand pieces. </p><p>THE TELEPATHIC PICK-UP </p><p>829 </p><p>HERE was a strange light in Doctor </p><p>Spaulding's eyes. His face was im- </p><p>mobile, but the lines were set in an </p><p>expression of jubilance and triumph. </p><p>“Come on, Brant,” he said quietly, “I </p><p>have something interesting to show you." </p><p> With that remark, he wheeled, and strode into</p><p>the gloom of the hall. I followed, and our footsteps </p><p>echoed with hollowness in that spacious, blank </p><p>space. </p><p> I had always felt a certain timidity when with</p><p>Doctor Spaulding. We had been friends for years, </p><p>and yet strangers. His was a personality which </p><p>had seemingly been fashioned for dominance over </p><p>me. I had never been able, in our long acquaint- </p><p>ance, to raise my head squarely, and hold the gaze </p><p>of his eyes. My fount of conversation dried up </p><p>beneath the queer influence of him, and I was re- </p><p>served and stumbling in my speech. </p><p> I admired, with no malice, his genius—his ec-</p><p>centric and versatile genius that had placed him at </p><p>the head of his profession, had made him an emin- </p><p>ent scientist, and had allowed him to conquer the </p><p>fleld of electricity. He had performed, during his </p><p>career, many marvelous feats of surgery, had made </p><p>important advances in both astronomy and chem- </p><p>istry, and had given countless electrical inventions </p><p>to the world. Of late years, he had devoted himself </p><p>entirely to electrical research. </p><p> I had seen him but once in the last year and a</p><p>half. At that meeting he had hinted to me that he </p><p>was at work on a radio apparatus that would </p><p>startle the world. </p><p> “It won’t be called radio though, Brant,” he had</p><p>told me with a dry, rasping chuckle. “It shall have </p><p>another name. When it is finished, I shall explain </p><p>it all first to you.” </p><p> So when I received his phone call I concluded</p><p>that he had completed the </p><p>invention, and I was </p><p>burning with curiosity as </p><p>I followed him down the </p><p>hall. </p><p> He turned into the liv-</p><p>ing room. That chamber </p><p>was no darker, no emptier, </p><p>and no more gloomy </p><p>than any other room in</p><p>his house, but I loathed it </p><p>even more than the other. </p><p>For always as I entered, </p><p>1 was brought face to face </p><p>with a portrait of the </p><p>doctor’s brother, and the </p><p>tragedy was forcibly re- </p><p>called to me. It had been </p><p>many years ago, but time had not dulled it in my </p><p>friend’s mind, nor my own. I could well remem- </p><p>ber that night, and Tom Spaulding’s flight, a </p><p>jump ahead of the law, because he was wanted </p><p>for embezzlement of fifty thousand dollars. The </p><p>disgrace of it had crushed the doctor, and because </p><p>it was his beloved brother, the blow was even </p><p>greater. It had aged and changed him, and sent him </p><p>into the life of a recluse. That it was responsible for </p><p>his many invaluable discoveries was probable, but </p><p>not any less regrettable, at least to me. As for </p><p>Tom Spaulding, we had not heard of him since </p><p>that night, but perhaps that was just as well, for </p><p>we learned later that he had sunk to the lowest </p><p>level of the underworld. </p><p> I gave the picture as fleeting a glance as pos-</p><p>sible, but the doctor stood for a long while gazing up </p><p>at it. He seemed lost in revery. At last he recov- </p><p>ered himself with a start, motioned me to a chair, </p><p>and turned to the huge mahogany table. He bent </p><p>over a large, box-like cabinet of dark wood, like </p><p>and yet unlike the ordinary radio set. He tinkered </p><p>for a few minutes with the knobs and dials. Then </p><p>he faced me again. </p><p> “This is the invention,” he said. “Remember, the</p><p>last time I saw you I told you I was working on a </p><p>super-radio? This is it, a telepathy radio. I have </p><p>succeeded in trapping those elusive emanations— </p><p>thought-waves. I won’t bore you with any explana- </p><p>tion of the inner workings of the machine. It is </p><p>enough that I went to the radio and the seismo- </p><p>graph to produce it. I called you so that I could </p><p>give you a demonstration, as I promised. You are </p><p>the first person to whom I have shown it. Of </p><p>course, I have given it a number of tests. It seems </p><p>to be a success.” </p><p> His eyes had lighted with ardor, and his voice</p><p>had risen to an unusual pitch. But almost simul- </p><p>taneously this enthusiasm waned, and his face be- </p><p>came very grave. </p><p> “You know, Brant,” he said slowly. “I have never</p><p>given up hope of finding Tom. I believe he is still</p><p>living. I am sure of it. I want to find him. That </p><p>was the incentive for this invention. I can locate </p><p>him with this apparatus. That is what I am going to </p><p>try to do tonight. If he lives, his mind will speak </p><p>through this loud speaker. You understand the </p><p>radio. Well, this machine is similar. It must be </p><p>tuned into the thought-wave length of the man you </p><p>wish to reach. But the machine must broadcast to </p><p>receive, that is, the tuning- </p><p>ing consists of the broad- </p><p>casting of a key thought. </p><p>If you were seeking a mur- </p><p>derer: you would broad- </p><p>cast some thought con- </p><p>cerning the crime, where- </p><p>upon the receiving section </p><p>of themachine would draw </p><p>in every unspoken reflec- </p><p>tion on it, and convert each </p><p>into words. If your key </p><p>thought were something </p><p>known to many, perhaps </p><p>published in the papers, </p><p>the machine would utter a </p><p>MKflWBMffggSESSTM jumble of tones and voices, </p><p> blurred by one another.</p><p>It would be a Babel, so many thoughts, each from </p><p>a different head. But then the operator would con- </p><p>tinue his broadcasting, thinking into the machine, </p><p>With these pseudo-receiving phones, varying reflec- </p><p>tions on the crime, gradually leading to some clue, </p><p>some phase known only to the police and the crim- </p><p>inal. The million voices would instantly dwindle </p><p>to a dozen or so, whereupon it would be easy to vary </p><p>the wave-length a millionth part of a hairsbreadth, </p><p>and so bring in the felon's thoughts, alone and clear. </p><p>You may see then that I have a very dangerous con- </p><p>traption here, the more so since the mind is un- </p><p> 'T'HIS gripping story— worthy of a Poe—is based in a</p><p> degree, upon radio.

(But, as I said be- </p><p>fore, I made it only that I might find Tom, and now </p><p>I shall make the attempt. There is a key thought </p><p>that only he can respond to, an incident of our boy- </p><p>hood known, I believe, only to us.” </p><p> He seated himself at the apparatus and adjusted</p><p>the head-phones. He became intent, lapsing into </p><p>a deep study. I sat silent, tense with curiosity and </p><p>awe. There was a long stillness, broken only by the </p><p>ticking of the hall clock. The methodical sound of </p><p>its mechanism so frayed my nerves that I got up, </p><p>and stopped it. Then I tiptoed back to my seat. Dr. </p><p>Spaulding had not noticed my move. </p><p> Presently, with an abruptness that made me start,</p><p>the loud speaker began to utter sounds. The doctor </p><p>removed his headpiece, and we leaned forward taut- </p><p>ly. The sounds were unintelligible at first. Then </p><p>they became clear. </p><p> “It’s Tom,” murmurd the doctor, as he recognized</p><p>the voice, and he looked happy for the first time in </p><p>years. </p><p> “Dawn is coming,” said the machine. “The first</p><p>hint of light. Oh God!” </p><p> There came a confusion of sounds, a jumble of</p><p>Incoherent words, then clearly: </p><p> “Here they come. I see the guards and the priest.</p><p>Oh God! They are coming! They are coming! </p><p> “They walk so slowly, so solemnly. The guards</p><p>and the priest. He is in his robe. I see his crucifix. </p><p>It is swaying on its chain as he walks. The heels </p><p>are beating so regularly. So perfectly in time. Oh </p><p>God! The guards. They look grim, grim as the </p><p>law! Law! It is law! There is no escape. Can I </p><p>beat them down ? The window. The door. A gun. </p><p>Rush them when they open the door. They’ll kill </p><p>me. Kill me! The chair!” </p><p> The doctor’s face had gone white and drawn. He</p><p>seemed turned to stone. His fingers were tight. </p><p>The machine went on in its monotonous monotone. </p><p> “A rat is watching. Its eyes are bright. It is a</p><p>gray rat. How long its nose is. Long and sharp. </p><p>It is laughing. There. The key is turning. How </p><p>slowly it grits. The bolt is drawn. The door is </p><p>opening. It is opening slowly, so slowly.

Its eyes are bright, </p><p>so bright. God save me I” </p><p> The sounds became incoherent and jangling. The</p><p>doctor had not moved. The voice became audible </p><p>again: </p><p> “Now, walk, walk, walk. Click, click, click.</p><p>Guards, so grim. I’ll run. Useless. There’s so </p><p>much steel. Steel everywhere. I’m caught.

No. Everything is the same. </p><p>I can’t be dead. The doctor is examining me. He </p><p>says, ‘I pronounce this man dead.’ ” </p><p> There was a pause. The doctor had not moved a</p><p>muscle. His face was the hue of the grave. His </p><p>eyes were indescribable, frozen. </p><p> He had not seized the significance of the last</p><p>words, apparently, but I had. In spite of the horror </p><p>I was sunk in, I realized that a theory of Dr. Spauld- </p><p>ing’s had been proven. </p><p> It was fully ten years since the doctor had aroused</p><p>much interest with his attack on the use of the </p><p>electric chair. It was his theory that in no case did </p><p>electricity actually kill—that it merely brought on</p><p>a paresis that simulated death, striking dormant </p><p>the entire organism. He had cited instances of men </p><p>struck by lightning, who had recovered, after many </p><p>days, of total paralysis during which they retained </p><p>only sight, hearing, and consciousness. Strange it </p><p>was, and hideous, that tonight the doctor’s own </p><p>brother was proving the theory. The machine spoke </p><p>again: </p><p> “The fool. He says I am dead. The fool. I wish</p><p>I could talk. I would call him a fool. I would laugh </p><p>at him. But I can’t move. </p><p> “The men are leaving. The guards are unstrap-</p><p>ping me. They catch me as I fall. They are taking </p><p>me out, through the little door. They are taking </p><p>me down a long hall. </p><p> “I would like to shout at them. They think I am</p><p>dead. </p><p> “The numbness has gone. I can feel their hands</p><p>holding me. I can feel more intensely than before. </p><p> “They are carrying me into a room. What are</p><p>they going to do ? My God, are they going to bury </p><p>me? No, it is the prison hospital. They are going </p><p>to bring me to life. Thank the good God! They lay </p><p>me on a table, the guards. But are they the guards? </p><p>They act differently.

I’ve just come </p><p>from there.” </p><p> My face must have reflected the varying emotions</p><p>that this statement produced within me, but Joe’s </p><p>countenance remained passive. “Murdered," he </p><p>asked quietly. “How?” </p><p> “Stabbed in the back.” The Chief might have</p><p>been saying “Please pass the potatoes,” for all the </p><p>feeling expressed in his tones. </p><p> Joe shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t think you</p><p>want me, then,” he said. “It’s out of my line.” </p><p>“Yes, you’d think so,” agreed the Chief, “if it </p><p>wasn’t for the peculiar circumstances surrounding </p><p>the crime.” </p><p> “Peculiar circumstances? What’s peculiar about</p><p>them, anyway, Chief?” queried Joe. </p><p> “Well, for one thing, we can’t find the knife, or</p><p>whatever it was that he was stabbed with.” </p><p>“Murderer took it away with him,” suggested </p><p>Fenner. </p><p> The Chief’s face took on a pained look. “Maybe</p><p>he did,” he said, wearily, “only—there’s no possible </p><p>way he could get in to Btab the man in the first </p><p>place, and no way that he could get out after he </p><p>had stabbed him in the second place. And in the </p><p>third place the crime simply couldn’t have been </p><p>committed at all, but it was. And there you are.” </p><p>“Chief, you talk through your hat,” reproved </p><p>the amazing Fenner with astounding disregard of </p><p>the deference due one in the Chief’s position. </p><p>“There must be a perfectly simple way in which </p><p>some one got into the place and away again.” </p><p> The Chief arose. “My car’s outside,” he said.</p><p>“Come along down and have a look.” </p><p> As Fenner hesitated I took my cue. ‘Til ride along</p><p>as far as my house if you don't mind,” I said. </p><p> “You’ll ride along and have a look with me” said</p><p>Fenner, warmly. “1 know you’re just as curious as </p><p>1 am to get a look at the scene of this remarkable </p><p>crime.” </p><p> The Chief was almost friendly. “Yes,” he invited,</p><p>“come along. It’s possible that an outsider might </p><p>see something that we’ve all missed and you can’t </p><p>do any harm.”</p><p> Nothing loath, I accepted the invitation and</p><p>rode down to the Atwood Building in the tonneau </p><p>with Fenner. The Chief was busy driving and I </p><p>managed to whisper to Fenner, “When did you get </p><p>such a pull with the police?” </p><p> He gave an amused laugh. “Oh, I answer techni-</p><p>cal questions for them occasionally. My chief asset </p><p>id the fact that few know that 1 have any interest in </p><p>these affairs at all. You’ll be a clam, I know.” </p><p> The car stopped in front of the Atwood just then</p><p>and I had no chance to question him further. </p><p> The Atwood was one of our skyscraper office</p><p>buildings. The Chief entered the corridor, steered </p><p>us into an elevator and we were whisked aloft. “Six- </p><p>teenth floor,” grunted the Chief to the operator, and </p><p>we stepped out into the corridor on that story. </p><p> Following Chief Davidson, we came to a suite</p><p>of offices, the frosted glass on the door bearing </p><p>the legend, “Corey &amp; Co., General Offices.” “Phew!” </p><p>gasped Fenner. “Who was it? Not-?” </p><p> Davidson paused with his hand on the knob. “Yes,</p><p>it was. Old John Corey and you can guess the com- </p><p>motion this’ll make,” </p><p> He flung open the door, and we filed in. The</p><p>policeman on guard touched his cap in salute to </p><p>his superior. We were in an outer office. Several </p><p>desks were arranged around the room, and at one </p><p>of them three girls huddled in a scared little group. </p><p>One was sobbing softly. I noticed a man with his </p><p>back toward us, looking out the window into space, </p><p>apparently. </p><p> Paying no attention to the occupants of this room,</p><p>Davidson strode across to a door marked “John </p><p>Corey, Private.” Opening it, he paused on the </p><p>threshold. Fenner and 1 crowded at his back. Over </p><p>his shoulder I could see into the inner office. A </p><p>man, clad in a grey suit, was on the floor on his </p><p>hands and knees. He looked up quickly. </p><p> “Come ahead,” he said to the Chief, “you can’t</p><p>spoil any marks. There’s nothing to spoil.” </p><p> We entered.</p><p> Seated at a desk in the center of the room was</p><p>a man. His head rested on the flat top of the desk, </p><p>his arms flung forward before him. Davidson </p><p>nodded toward him. “Just as he was found,” he</p><p>said, simply. It was my first sight of violent death. </p><p> Horror, or some other violent emotion, making</p><p>my heart throb jerkily, I moved forward with Fen- </p><p>ner, and looked down at the corpse. </p><p> A glance at the bowed back told the tale. The</p><p>coat was soaked with blood, which had welled from </p><p>a gaping wound below the left shoulder blade. I’ll </p><p>never tell you why I didn’t faint. I wanted to. </p><p> Fenner turned to the man in grey. “What have</p><p>you learned, Frank?” he asked. </p><p> Frank, who was evidently a detective, shook his</p><p>head gloomily. “Nothing,” he replied, “except what </p><p>you see. He’s been stabbed, that’s evident, and </p><p>whoever did it took the weapon away with him. But </p><p>how he got in here, and how he got out, God alone </p><p>knows. I’ve been over this floor on my hands and </p><p>knees with a microscope. There’s not a mark. Not </p><p>a foot print in the dust, except those made by Corey </p><p>himself. Nothing. Not a finger print on the walls, </p><p>on the desk, on the body, on the floor, on the door </p><p>knob—inside or out—not anywhere. It's beyond </p><p>me.” </p><p> “Couldn't come in through the outer office, eh?"</p><p>Fenner's eyes were roving over the room. Frank </p><p>shook his head slowly in negation. “Three girls </p><p>and the head bookkeeper out there all evening, </p><p>working overtime. All swear not one of them has </p><p>been in this room this evening. Corey came in </p><p>through the outer office—the only way he could </p><p>come In, for this office has only the one entrance— </p><p>and closed the door. About half past eight one of </p><p>the girls opened the door to come in. She saw that </p><p>something had happened to Corey, and she didn’t </p><p>cross the threshold. All of them had sense enough </p><p>to stay out. They telephoned for us. I was the </p><p>first man in.” </p><p> “No other doors?”</p><p> “Nope. Only one way in. Through that office.”</p><p> Fenner was gazing at the wall on the street side.</p><p>“Did you open that window?” he asked. </p><p> “No. It was open. But it might as well have</p><p>been bricked up for all the good it’s going to do us. </p><p>Corey opened it himself, no doubt. It's just sixteen </p><p>stories to the street, and you can bet no one climbed </p><p>up to it. It’s five stories to the roof. One chance </p><p>in one thousand that any one climbed down. It </p><p>would take nerves of steel to drop over the edge on </p><p>THE EDUCATED HARPOON </p><p>833 </p><p>a rope, and if some one did have the nerve, he </p><p>couldn’t have gotten in by that window noiselessly </p><p>enough not to warn Corey. And just assuming </p><p>that he did, he’d surely leave a mark doing it, </p><p>wouldn’t he?” </p><p> Fenner nodded. “He certainly would,” he ac-</p><p>quiesced. “How about the people in the office out </p><p>there? Are they all above suspicion?” </p><p> “All above it,” complained Frank, “and not only</p><p>that, but the very number of them lets them out </p><p>without question. It’s not reasonable to suppose </p><p>that three girls and a man, all trusted employees, </p><p>would conspire to kill their employer without a </p><p>motive for doing so. One of them might try it, or </p><p>maybe even two, but it’s hardly likely that all four </p><p>would be against the man.” </p><p> "Right you are,” admitted Fenner, “I thought</p><p>that way myself, but we have to eliminate the pos- </p><p>sibility of an inside job first. Well, Chief, I don’t </p><p>see that I can do you any good in this matter. It </p><p>is unusual enough to be interesting, and if you don’t </p><p>mind I’ll drop in and have a look around in the </p><p>morning.” </p><p> "Help yourself,” gloomed Davidson. “I don’t be-</p><p>lieve you can do anything in this case myself. I </p><p>just took a chance. You might have, you know.” </p><p> “I wish that I could have. And I’ll look it over</p><p>in the morning on the off chance. Good night, </p><p>Frank, and good luck. Good night, Chief. Come </p><p>on, Bill,” and we left. </p><p> As we walked homeward, Fenner said: “It seems</p><p>that the days of miracles are not gone by, after all. </p><p>What do you think of that for a puzzle?” </p><p> “It’s beyond me,” I replied, soberly. “The only</p><p>possible explanation that I can think of is that the </p><p>man committed suicide.” </p><p> Joe stood still and rocked with laughter. “Oh,</p><p>Bill, Bill,” he gasped, “there’s only one man in a </p><p>million—yes, I’ll make it a billion—that commits </p><p>suicide by stabbing himself in the back, to say noth- </p><p>ing of calmly disposing of the weapon just after </p><p>he’s dead.” </p><p> “Well, then,” I demanded, sullenly, “how do you</p><p>account for the thing?” </p><p> He grew thoughtful at once. “I can’t,” he ad-</p><p>mitted, “unless-” </p><p> “Unless what?” I asked, as he paused.</p><p> “Unless—unless—well, I wouldn't want to say</p><p>unless anything just now. Would you like to go </p><p>down with me again tomorrow morning?” </p><p> “I certainly would,” I rejoined, instantly. “This</p><p>thing’s got my goat.” </p><p> “All right, then. I’ll stop for you on my way</p><p>down.” </p><p> I lay awake for hours trying to figure out how</p><p>the thing could have been done. There didn't seem </p><p>to be a plausible explanation. If the facts in the </p><p>case had been handed to me us a sort of a puzzle, </p><p>I would have said that it simply couldn’t be done. </p><p>And yet—there was the dead man. </p><p> Eventually I gave it up and fell into a restless</p><p>slumber. </p><p>******** * </p><p>Next morning Fenner called for me as arranged. </p><p>“Well,” he asked, cheerfully, “have you solved the </p><p>mystery over night?” </p><p> “No,” I said. “It seems more baffling than ever</p><p>after a night’s thought. Have you found the </p><p>answer?” </p><p> “Not yet. Do you happen to have a good pair</p><p>of field glasses?” </p><p>I had, and I produced them. “That’s fine,” said </p><p>Fenner after carefully examining them. “Let’s go.” </p><p>We had no trouble getting into Corey’s offices. </p><p>The body had been removed, and practically all </p><p>traces of the tragedy had disappeared. </p><p> Fenner dropped into the chair which so lately</p><p>had been used by the hapless victim. As he sat at </p><p>the desk his back was to the window, which had </p><p>been closed. </p><p> “Well,” he mused, “how was this man killed?</p><p>If this chair could only talk. Suppose I was across </p><p>the street in another building. Ah! Say I’m an </p><p>old whaler. I have a harpoon and a coil of rope. </p><p>The window is open in this office. That broad back </p><p>is a fine target-. Bill, look out that window </p><p>and see if I couldn't do it.” </p><p> I turned to Fenner, and in my most sarcastic</p><p>tones I said: “You could, Joe, if you had an edu- </p><p>cated harpoon. After you threw it, it would pause </p><p>cannily in mid-air, turn at an angle of forty-five </p><p>degrees, leap agilely up about six stories, make </p><p>another forty-five degree turn, slide gracefully </p><p>through the window, and- </p><p> But Fenner was on his feet and beside me. His</p><p>face was grave, but his eyes twinkled. “Sufficient </p><p>William,” he said, “your sarcasm is excellent, but </p><p>I’m too busy to listen to the rest of it. Let's have </p><p>those field glasses.” </p><p> Ten minutes passed. I began to grow fidgety, when</p><p>he suddenly handed the glasses to me. “Bill,” he </p><p>said, “do you see that building out there—the one </p><p>that appears to be as high as this one 7” </p><p> “I do,” I replied. “That could only be the Yeakle.</p><p>It and the Atwood are the two tallest buildings we </p><p>have.” </p><p> “Well, look it over carefully, and tell me if you</p><p>make out a clothes line on the roof.” </p><p> I gazed. At first I didn’t see one, but presently</p><p>I located it, I told Fenner that there was undoubt- </p><p>edly a clothes line there. </p><p> “So I thought,” he said, absently. “Well—let’s</p><p>call Davidson over here. It’s up to him now.” </p><p> I stared, amazed. “Up to him,” I parroted.</p><p>“What’s up to him?” </p><p>“The arrest of the murderer,” said Fenner, rather </p><p>impatiently. “You're on to the thing, aren’t you?” </p><p>“Do you mean that you know who killed Corey?” </p><p>I asked, excitedly, as Fenner reached for the tele- </p><p>phone. </p><p> He paused with his hand on the receiver. “No,</p><p>I don’t. But I know what he was killed with—and </p><p>Davidson will find out the rest.” </p><p> “Well,” I demanded, “what was he killed with?”</p><p>Fenner called a number into the ’phone and gave </p><p>me a sweet smile over his shoulder as he waited. </p><p>“That chunk of clothes line, and-” he grew ex- </p><p>ceedingly sarcastic, “an educated harpoon.” </p><p> Nor would he say more until Davidson, with</p><p>Frank at his heels, burst into the room seething </p><p>with excitement. </p><p> “What’s this, Joe,” panted the Chief. “Find</p><p>something? Got anything?"</p><p>Joe leaned back in his chair, and I saw that he was </p><p>enjoying himself immensely. “Yes, Chief,” he said, </p><p>cheerfully, “I know what forey was killed with.” </p><p>The Chief darted a fiery glance at Frank. “And </p><p>(Continued on page 869) </p><p> $he Diamond Lens</p><p>^ 'Bif Fitz^James O'Brien * </p><p>Author of “The Wondersmith” </p><p>While Simon was relating this to me, I regarded the great diamond attentively. Never had I beheld anything so beautiful. All </p><p>the glories of light, ever Imagined or described, seamed to pulsato in its crystalline chambers. Its weight, aa 1 learned from SIraon, </p><p>was exactly one hundred and forty carats. </p><p>834 </p><p>THE DIAMOND LENS </p><p>835 </p><p>CHAPTER I </p><p>The Bending of the Twig </p><p>a very early period of my life the </p><p>•e bent of my inclinations had been </p><p>rds microscopic investigations, </p><p>n I was not more than ten years </p><p>a distant relative of our family, </p><p>hoping to astonish my inexperience, constructed </p><p>a simple microscope for me, by drilling in a disk </p><p>of copper a small hole, in which a drop of pure </p><p>water was sustained by capillary attraction. This </p><p>very primitive apparatus, magnifying some fifty </p><p>diameters, presented, it is true, only indistinct and </p><p>imperfect forms, but still sufficiently wonderful to </p><p>work up my imagination to a preternatural state of </p><p>excitement. </p><p> Seeing me so interested in this rude instrument,</p><p>my cousin explained to me all that he knew about </p><p>the principles of the microscope, related to me a </p><p>few of the wonders which had been accomplished </p><p>through its agency, and ended by promising to send </p><p>me one regularly constructed, immediately on his </p><p>return to the city. I counted the days, the hours, </p><p>the minutes, that intervened between that promise </p><p>and his departure. </p><p> Meantime I was not idle. Every transparent sub-</p><p>stance that bore the remotest resemblance to a lens </p><p>I eagerly seized upon, and employed in vain at- </p><p>tempts to realize that instrument, the theory of </p><p>whose construction I as yet only vaguely compre- </p><p>hended. All panes of glass containing those oblate </p><p>spheroidal knots familiarly known as “bull’s eyes” </p><p>were ruthlessly destroyed, in the hope of obtaining </p><p>lenses of marvellous power. I even went so far </p><p>as to extract the crystalline humor from the eyes </p><p>of fishes and animals, and endeavored to press it into </p><p>the microscopic service. I plead guilty to having </p><p>stolen the glasses from my Aunt Agatha’s spectacles, </p><p>with a dim idea of grinding them into lenses of won- </p><p>drous magnifying pro- </p><p>perties,—in which at- </p><p>tempt it is scarcely neces- </p><p>sary to say that I totally </p><p>failed. </p><p>A Real Microscope at Last </p><p>T last the promised </p><p>instrument came. It </p><p>was of that order known </p><p>as Field’s simple micro-</p><p>scope, and had cost </p><p>perhaps about fifteen dol- </p><p>lars. As far as educa- </p><p>tional purposes went, a </p><p>better apparatus could </p><p>not have been selected. Accompanying it was a </p><p>small treatise on the microscope,—its history, </p><p>uses, and discoveries. I comprehended then </p><p>for the first time the “Arabian Nights Enter- </p><p>tainments.” The dull veil of ordinary existence that </p><p>hung‘across the world seemed suddenly to roll away, </p><p>and to lay bare a land of enchantments. I felt to- </p><p>wards my companions as the seer might feel to. </p><p>wards the ordinary masses of men. I held con- </p><p>versations with nature in a tongue which they could </p><p>not understand. I was in daily communication with </p><p>living wonders, such as they never imagined in their </p><p>wildest visions. I penetrated beyond the external </p><p>portal of things, and roamed through the sanc- </p><p>tuaries. Where they beheld only a drop of rain </p><p>slowly rolling down the window-glass, I saw a uni- </p><p>verse of beings animated with all the passions com- </p><p>mon to physical life, and convulsing their minute </p><p>sphere with struggles as fierce and protracted as </p><p>those of men. In the common spots of mould, </p><p>which my mother, good housekeeper that she was, </p><p>fiercely scooped away from her jam pots, there </p><p>abode for me, under the name of mildew, enchanted </p><p>gardens, filled with dells and avenues of the densest </p><p>foliage and most astonishing verdure, while from </p><p>the fantastic boughs of these microscopic forests </p><p>hung strange fruits glittering with green, and sil- </p><p>ver, and gold. </p><p> It was no scientific thirst that at this time filled</p><p>my mind. It was the pure enjoyment of a poet </p><p>to whom a world of wonders had been disclosed. </p><p>I talked of my solitary pleasures to none. Alone </p><p>with my microscope, I dimmed my sight, day after </p><p>day and night after night, poring over the marvels </p><p>which it unfolded to me. I was like one who, hav- </p><p>ing discovered the ancient Eden still existing in all </p><p>its primitive glory, should resolve to enjoy it in soli- </p><p>tude, and never betray to mortal the secret of its </p><p>locality. The rod of my life was bent at this mo- </p><p>ment. I destined myself to be a microscopist. </p><p>He Imagines Himself a Discoverer </p><p>OF course, like every novice, I fancied myself a </p><p>discoverer. I was ignorant at the time of the </p><p>thousands of acute intellects engaged in the same </p><p>pursuit as myself, and with the advantage of instru- </p><p>ments a thousand times more powerful than mine. </p><p>The names of Leeuwenhoek, Williamson, Spencer, </p><p>Ehrenberg, Schultz, Dujardin, Schact, and Schleiden </p><p>were then entirely unknown to me, or if known,</p><p>I was ignorant of their patient and wonderful re- </p><p>searches. In every fresh specimen of cryptogamia </p><p>which I placed beneath </p><p>my instrument I believed </p><p>that I discovered wonders </p><p>of which the world was </p><p>as yet ignorant. I re- </p><p>member well the thrill of </p><p>delight and admiration </p><p>that shot through me the </p><p>first time that I dis- </p><p>covered the common </p><p>wheel animalcule (Roti- </p><p>fera vulgaris) expanding </p><p>and contracting its flex- </p><p>ible spokes, and seemingly </p><p>rotating through the </p><p>water. Alas! as I grew </p><p>older, and obtained some works treating of my </p><p>favorite study, I found that I was only on the </p><p>threshhold of a science to the investigation of which </p><p>some of the greatest men of the age were devoting </p><p>their lives and intellects. </p><p> As I grew up, my parents, who saw but little</p><p>likelihood of anything practical resulting from the </p><p>examination of bits of moss and drops of water </p><p>through a brass tube and a piece of glass, were </p><p>anxious that I should choose a profession. It was </p><p>their desire that I should enter the counting-house </p><p>of my uncle, Ethan Blake, a prosperous merchant, </p><p> rPIIIS classic, by the famous author, is not as widely</p><p> known as it deserves to be. The story is a master-</p><p> piece from every angle, although it was written over</p><p> fifty years ago. There is no question that Mr. O'Brien</p><p> must have been an expert on microscopy, because only a</p><p> master could go into the details as he does in this story.</p><p> The theme, while fantastic, is beautiful in its extreme,</p><p> and the advent of the ultra-microscope, invented long</p><p> after O'Brien had died, lends nciv color to this story,</p><p> which can be read and re-read many times—a story that</p><p> will stand out from many others for generations to</p><p> come.</p><p>836 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>who carried on business in New York. This sug- </p><p>gestion I decisively combated. I had no taste for </p><p>trade; I should only make a failure; in short, I re- </p><p>fused to become a merchant. </p><p> But it was necessary for me to select some pur-</p><p>suit. My parents were staid New England people, </p><p>who insisted on the necessity of labor; and there- </p><p>fore, although, thanks to the bequest of my poor </p><p>Aunt Agatha, I should, on coming of age, inherit </p><p>a small fortune sufficient to place me above want, </p><p>it was decided that, instead of waiting for this, </p><p>I should act the nobler part, and employ the in- </p><p>tervening years in rendering myself independent. </p><p>Selecting a Profession </p><p>AFTER much cogitation I complied with the </p><p>wishes of my family, and selected a profession. </p><p>I determined to study medicine at the New York </p><p>Academy. This disposition of my future suited </p><p>me. A removal from my relatives would enable </p><p>me to dispose of my time as I pleased without fear </p><p>of detection. As long as I paid my Academy fees, </p><p>I might shirk attending the lectures if I chose; and, </p><p>as I never had the remotest intention of standing </p><p>an examination, there was no danger of my being </p><p>"plucked.” Besides, a metropolis was the place for </p><p>me. There I could obtain excellent instruments, the </p><p>newest publications, intimacy with men of pursuits </p><p>kindred with my own,—in short, all things neces- </p><p>sary to insure a profitable devotion of my life to </p><p>my beloved science. I had an abundance of money, </p><p>few desires that were not bounded by my illumi- </p><p>nating mirror on one side and my object-glass on </p><p>the other; what, therefore, was to prevent my be- </p><p>coming an illustrious investigator of the veiled </p><p>worlds? It was with the most buoyant hope that I </p><p>left my New England home and established my- </p><p>self in New York. </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>The Longing of a Man of Science </p><p>MY first step, of course, was to find suitable </p><p>apartments. These I obtained, after a </p><p>couple of days’ search, in Fourth Avenue; </p><p>a very pretty second-floor unfurnished, containing </p><p>sitting-room, bed-room, and a smaller apartment </p><p>which I intended to fit up as a laboratory. I fur- </p><p>nished my lodgings simply, but rather elegantly, </p><p>and then devoted all my energies to the adornment </p><p>of the temple of my worship. I visited Pike, the </p><p>celebrated optician, and passed in review his </p><p>splendid collection of microscopes,—Field’s Com-</p><p>pound, Hingham’s, Spencer’s, Nachet’s Binocular </p><p>(that founded on the principles of the stereoscope), </p><p>and at length fixed upon that form known as Spen- </p><p>cer’s Trunnion Microscope, as combining the great- </p><p>est number of improvements with an almost perfect </p><p>freedom from tremor. Along with this I pur- </p><p>chased every possible accessory,—draw-tubes, </p><p>micrometers, a camerarlucida, lever-stage, achro- </p><p>matic condensers, white cloud illuminators, prisms, </p><p>parabolic condensers, polarizing apparatus, forceps, </p><p>aquatic boxes, fishing-tubes, with a host of other </p><p>articles, all of which would have been useful in the </p><p>hands of an experienced microscopist, but, as I </p><p>afterwards discovered, were not of the slightest </p><p>present value to me. It takes years of practice to </p><p>know how to use a complicated microscope. The </p><p>optician looked suspiciously at me as I made these </p><p>wholesale purchases. He evidently was uncertain </p><p>whether to set me down as some scientific celebrity </p><p>or a madman. I think, he inclined to the latter </p><p>belief. I suppose I was mad. Every great genius </p><p>is mad upon the subject in which he is greatest. </p><p>The unsuccessful madman is disgraced and called a </p><p>lunatic. </p><p>At Last Some Real Discoveries Aro Madie </p><p>MAD or not, I set myself to work with a zeal </p><p>which few scientific students have ever </p><p>equalled. I had everything to learn relative to the </p><p>delicate study upon which I had embarked,—a study </p><p>involving the most earnest patience, the most rigid </p><p>analytic powers, the steadiest hand, the most un- </p><p>tiring eye, the most refined and subtile manipula- </p><p>tion.	i</p><p> For a long time half my apparatus lay inactively</p><p>on the shelves of my laboratory, which was now </p><p>most amply furnished with every possible con- </p><p>trivance for facilitating my investigations. The </p><p>fact was that I did not know how to use some of </p><p>my scientific implements,—never having been </p><p>taught microscopics,—and those whose use I un- </p><p>derstood theoretically were of little avail, until by </p><p>practice I could attain the necessary delicacy of </p><p>handling. Still, such was the fury of my ambition, </p><p>such the untiring perseverance of my experiments, </p><p>that, difficult of credit as it may be, in the course </p><p>of one year I became theoretically and practically </p><p>an accomplished microscopist. </p><p> During this period of my labors, in which I sub-</p><p>mitted specimens of every substance that came </p><p>under my observation to the action of my lenses, I </p><p>became a discoverer,—in a small way, it is true, </p><p>for I was very young, but still a discoverer. It </p><p>was I who destroyed Ehrenberg’s theory that the</p><p>Volvox globator was an animal, and proved that his </p><p>“monads” with stomachs and eyes were merely </p><p>phases of the formation of a vegetable cell, and </p><p>were, when they reached their mature state, incap- </p><p>able of the act of conjugation, or any true genera- </p><p>tive act, without which no organism rising to any </p><p>stage of life higher than vegetable can be said to be </p><p>complete. It was I who resolved the singular prob- </p><p>lem of rotation in the cells and hairs of plants into </p><p>ciliary attraction, in spite of the assertions of </p><p>Mr. Wenham and others, that my explanation was </p><p>the result of an optical illusion. </p><p> But notwithstanding these discoveries, labori-</p><p>ously and painfully made as they were, I ftelt </p><p>horribly dissatisfied. At every step I found myself </p><p>stopped by the imperfections of my instruments. </p><p>Like all active microscopists, I gave my imagination </p><p>full play. Indeed, it is a common complaint against </p><p>many such, that they supply the defects of their </p><p>instruments with the creations of their brains. I </p><p>imagined depths beyond depths in nature which </p><p>the limited power of my lenses prohibited me from </p><p>exploring. I lay awake at night constructing </p><p>imaginary microscopes of immeasurable power, </p><p>with which I seemed to pierce through all the </p><p>envelopes of matter down to its original atom. How </p><p>I cursed those imperfect media which necessity </p><p>through ignorance compelled me to use! How I </p><p>longed to discover the secret of some perfect lens, </p><p>whose magnifying power should be limited only </p><p>THE DIAMOND LENS </p><p>837 </p><p>by the resolvability of the object, and which at the </p><p>same time should be free from spherical and </p><p>chromatic aberrations, in short from all the obstacles </p><p>over which the poor microscopist finds himself con- </p><p>tinually stumbling! I felt convinced that the sim- </p><p>ple microscope, composed of a single lens of such </p><p>vast yet perfect power was possible of construction. </p><p>To attempt to bring the compound microscope up </p><p>to such a pitch would have been commencing at </p><p>the wrong end; this latter being simply a partially </p><p>successful endeavor to remedy those very defects </p><p>of the simple instrument, which, if conquered, would </p><p>leave nothing to be desired. </p><p>Working On the Manufacture of Microscopes </p><p>IT was in this mood of mind that I became a con- </p><p>structive microscopist. After another year pass- </p><p>ed in this new pursuit, experimenting on every </p><p>imaginable substance,—glass, gems, flints, crystals, </p><p>artificial crystals formed of the alloy of various </p><p>vitreous materials,—in short, having constructed as </p><p>many varieties of lenses as Argus had eyes, I </p><p>found znyself precisely where I started, with noth- </p><p>ing gained save an extensive knowledge of glass- </p><p>making. I was almost dead with despair. My </p><p>parents were surprised at my apparent want of </p><p>progress in my medical studies, (I had not attended </p><p>one lecture since my arrival in the city,) and the </p><p>expenses of my mad pursuit had been so great as </p><p>to embarrass me very seriously. </p><p> I was in this frame of mind one day, experiment-</p><p>ing in my laboratory on a small diamond,—that </p><p>stone, from its great refracting power, having al- </p><p>ways occupied my attention more than any other,— </p><p>when a young Frenchman, who lived on the floor </p><p>above me, and who was in the habit of occasionally </p><p>visiting me, entered the room. </p><p>In Search of a Diamond Microscope Lens </p><p>I THINK that Jules Simon was a Jew. He had </p><p>many traits of the Hebrew character: a love of </p><p>iewelry, of dress, and of good living. There was </p><p>iomething mysterious about him. He always had </p><p>something to sell, and yet went into excellent society. </p><p>When I say sell, I should perhaps have said peddle; </p><p>for his operations were generally confined to the </p><p>disposal of single articles,—a picture, for instance, </p><p>or a rare carving in ivory, or a pair of duelling- </p><p>pistols, or the dress of a Mexican Caballero. When I </p><p>was first furnishing my rooms, he paid me a visit, </p><p>which ended in my purchasing an antique silver </p><p>lamp, which he assured me was a Cellini,—it was</p><p>handsome enough even for that,—and some other </p><p>knickknacks for my sitting-room. Why Simon </p><p>should pursue this petty trade I never could imagine. </p><p>He apparently had plenty of money, and had the </p><p>entree of the best houses in the city,—taking care, </p><p>however, I suppose, to drive no bargains within the </p><p>enchanted circle of the Upper Ten. I came at length </p><p>to the conclusion that this peddling was but a mask </p><p>to cover some greater object, and even went so far </p><p>as to believe my young acquaintance to be implicated </p><p>in the slave-trade. That, however, was none of </p><p>my affair. </p><p> On the present occasion, Simon entered my room</p><p>in a state of considerable excitement. </p><p> “Ahl mon ami!” he cried, before I could even</p><p>.offer him the ordinary salutation, “it has occurred </p><p>to me to be the witness of the most astonishing </p><p>things in the world. I promenade myself to the </p><p>house of Madame- How does the little animal </p><p>—le renard—name himself in the Latin?” </p><p>A Spiritualistic Medium </p><p>CCT7ULPES,” I answered. </p><p> V “Ah! yes.—Vulpes. I promenade myself to</p><p>the house of Madame Vulpes.” </p><p> "The spirit medium?”</p><p> “Yes, the great medium. Great heavens! what a</p><p>woman! I write on a slip of paper many ques- </p><p>tions concerning affairs the most secret,—affairs </p><p>that conceal themselves in the abysses of my heart </p><p>the most profound; and behold! by example! what </p><p>occurs? This devil of a woman makes me replies </p><p>the most truthful to all of them. She talks to me </p><p>of things that I do not love to talk of to myself. </p><p>What am I to think? I am fixed to the earth!” </p><p>“Am I to understand you, M. Simon, that this </p><p>Mrs. Vulpes replied to questions secretly written by </p><p>you, which questions related to events known only </p><p>to yourself?” </p><p> "Ah! more than that, more than that,” he an-</p><p>swered, with an air of some alarm. “She related to </p><p>me things— But,” he added, after a pause, and </p><p>suddenly changing his manner, “why occupy our- </p><p>selves with these follies? It was all the biology, </p><p>without doubt. It goes without saying that it has </p><p>not my credence.—But why are we here, mon ami? </p><p>It has occurred to me to discover the most beautiful </p><p>thing as you can imagine,—a vase with green</p><p>lizards on it, composed by the great Bernard Palissy. </p><p>It is in my apartment; let us mount. I go to show </p><p>it to you.” </p><p> I followed Simon mechanically; but my thoughts</p><p>were far from Palissy and his enamelled ware, al- </p><p>though I, like him, was seeking in the dark a great </p><p>discovery. This casual mention of the spiritualist, </p><p>Madame Vulpes, set me on a new track. What if </p><p>this spiritualism should be really a great fact? </p><p>What if, through communication with more subtile </p><p>organisms than my own, I could reach at a single </p><p>bound the goal, which perhaps a life of agonizing </p><p>mental toil would never enable me to attain? </p><p> While purchasing the Palissy vase from my</p><p>friend Simon, I was mentally arranging a visit to </p><p>Madame Vulpes. </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>The Spirit of Leeuwenhoek </p><p>TWO eveningB after this, thanks to an arrange- </p><p>ment by letter and the promise of an ample </p><p>fee, I found Madame Vulpes awaiting me at </p><p>her residence alone. She was a coarse-featured </p><p>woman, with keen and rather cruel dark eyes, and </p><p>%n exceedingly sensual expression about her mouth </p><p>and under jaw. She received me in perfect silence, </p><p>in an apartment on the ground floor, very sparely </p><p>furnished. In the centre of the room, close to </p><p>where Mrs. Vulpes sat, there was a common round </p><p>mahogany table. If I had come for the purpose </p><p>of sweeping her chimney, the woman could not have </p><p>looked more indifferent to my appearance. There </p><p>was no attempt to inspire the visitor with awe. </p><p>Everything bore a simple and practical aspect. </p><p>838 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>This intercourse with the spiritual world was </p><p>evidently as familiar an occupation with Mrs. Vulpe3 </p><p>as eating her dinner or riding in an omnibus. </p><p> “You come for a communication, Mr. Linley?”</p><p>said the medium, in a dry, business-like tone of </p><p>voice. </p><p> “By appointment,—yes.”</p><p> “What sort of communication do you want?—a</p><p>•written one?” </p><p> “Yes,—I wish for a written one.”</p><p> “From any particular spirt?”</p><p> “Yes.”</p><p>“Have you ever known this spirit on this earth?” </p><p>“Never. He died long before I was born. I </p><p>•wish merely to obtain from him some information </p><p>which he ought to be able to give better than any </p><p>other.” </p><p> “Will you seat yourself at the table, Mr. Linley,”</p><p>said the medium, “and place your hands upon it?” </p><p>I obeyed,—Mrs. Vulpes being seated opposite to </p><p>me, with her hands also on the table. We remained </p><p>thus for about a minute and a half, when a violent </p><p>succession of raps came on the table, on the back </p><p>of my chair, on the floor immediately under my feet, </p><p>and even on the windowpanes. Mrs. Vulpes smiled </p><p>composedly. </p><p> “They are very strong to-night,” she remarked.</p><p>“You are fortunate.” She then continued, “Will the </p><p>spirits communicate with this gentleman?” </p><p>Vigorous affirmative. </p><p> “Will the particular spirit he desires to speak</p><p>with communicate?” </p><p> A very confused rapping followed this question.</p><p> “I know what they mean,” said Mrs. Vulpes,</p><p>addressing herself to me; “they wish you to write </p><p>down the name of the particular spirit that you de- </p><p>sire to converse with. Is that so?” she added, </p><p>speaking to her invisible guests. </p><p> That it was so was evident from the numerous</p><p>affirmatory responses. While this was going on, I </p><p>tore a slip from my pocket-book, and scribbled a</p><p>name, under the table. </p><p> “Will this spirit communicate in writing with this</p><p>gentleman?” asked the medium once more. </p><p> After a moment’s pause, her hand seemed to be</p><p>seized with a violent tremor, shaking so forcibly </p><p>that the table vibrated. She said that a spirit had </p><p>seized her hand and would write. I handed her </p><p>some sheets of paper that were on the table, and a </p><p>pencil. The latter she held loosely in her hand, </p><p>which presently began to move over the paper with </p><p>a singular and seemingly involuntary motion. After </p><p>a few moments had elapsed, she handed me the </p><p>paper, on which I found written, in a large, unculti- </p><p>vated hand, the words, “He is not here, but has been </p><p>sent for.” A pause of a minute or so now ensued, </p><p>during which Mrs. Vulpes remained perfectly silent, </p><p>but the raps continued at regular intervals. When </p><p>the short period I mention had elapsed, the hand of </p><p>the medium was again seized with its convulsive </p><p>tremor, and she wrote, under this strange influence, </p><p>a few words on the paper, which she handed to me. </p><p>They were as follows:—* </p><p> “I am here. Question me.</p><p>“Leeuwenhoek.” </p><p> I was astounded. The name was identical with</p><p>that I had written beneath the table, and carefully </p><p>kept concealed. Neither was it at all probable that </p><p>Bn uncultivated woman like Mrs. Vulpes should </p><p>know even the name of the great father of micro- </p><p>scopics. It may have been biology; but this theory </p><p>was soon doomed to be destroyed. I wrote on my </p><p>slip—still concealing it from Mrs. Vulpes—a series </p><p>of questions, which, to avoid tediousness, I shall </p><p>place with the responses, in the order in which they </p><p>occurred:— </p><p> I.—Can the microscope be brought to perfection?</p><p> Spirit.—Yes.</p><p> I.—Am I destined to accomplish this great task?</p><p> Spieit.—You are.</p><p> I.—I wish to know how to proceed to attain this</p><p>end. For the love which you bear to science, help </p><p>'me! </p><p> Spirit.—A diamond of one hundred and forty</p><p>carats, submitted to electro-magnetic currents for a </p><p>long period, will experience a rearrangement of its </p><p>atoms inter se, and from that stone you will form</p><p>•the universal lens. </p><p> I.—Will great discoveries result from the use</p><p>of such a lens? </p><p> Spirit.—So great that all that has gone before</p><p>is as nothing. </p><p> I.—But the refractive power of the diamond is</p><p>so immense, that the image will be formed within </p><p>the lens. How is that difficulty to be surmounted? </p><p> Spirit.—Pierce the lens through its axis, and the</p><p>difficulty is obviated. The image will be formed in </p><p>the pierced space, which will itself serve as a tube </p><p>to look through. Now I am called. Good night </p><p>The Diamond Found </p><p>I CANNOT at all describe the effect that these ex- </p><p>traordinary communications had upon me. I </p><p>felt completely bewildered. No biological theory </p><p>could account for the discovery of the lens. The </p><p>medium might, by means of biological rapport with </p><p>my mind, have gone so far as to read my questions, </p><p>and reply to them coherently. But biology could </p><p>not enable her to discover that magnetic currents </p><p>would so alter the crystals of the diamond as to rem- </p><p>edy its previous defects, and admit of its being </p><p>polished into a perfect lens. Some such theory may </p><p>have passed through my head, it is true; but if so, </p><p>I had forgotten it. In my excited condition of mind </p><p>there was no course left but to become a convert, </p><p>and it was in a state of the most painful nervous </p><p>exaltation that I left the medium’s house that even- </p><p>ing. She accompanied me to the door, hoping that </p><p>I was satisfied. The raps followed us as we went </p><p>through the hall, sounding on the balusters, the </p><p>flooring, and even the lintels of the door. I hastily </p><p>expressed my satisfaction, and escaped hurriedly </p><p>into the cool night air. I walked home with but </p><p>one thought possessing me,—how to obtain a dia- </p><p>mond of the immense size required. My entire </p><p>means multiplied a hundred times over would have </p><p>been inadequate to its purchase. Besides, such </p><p>stones are rare, and become historical. I could </p><p>find such only in the regalia of Eastern or European </p><p>monarchs. </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>The Eye of Morning </p><p>THERE was a light in Simon’s room as I </p><p>entered my house. A vague impulse urged </p><p>me to visit him. As I opened the door of his </p><p>THE DIAMOND LENS </p><p>839 </p><p>sitting-room unannounced, he was bending, with his </p><p>back toward me, over a Carcel lamp, apparently </p><p>engaged in minutely examining some object which </p><p>he held in his hands. As I entered, he started sud- </p><p>denly, thrust his hand into his breast pocket, and </p><p>turned to me with a face crimson with confusion. </p><p> “What!” I cried, “poring over the miniature of</p><p>some fair lady? Well, don’t blush so much; I </p><p>won’t ask to see it.” </p><p> Simon laughed awkardly enough, but made none</p><p>of the negative protestations usual on such occa- </p><p>sions. He asked me to take a seat. </p><p> “Simon,” said I, “I have just come from Madame</p><p>Vulpes.” </p><p> This time Simon turned as white as a sheet, and</p><p>seemed stupefied, as if a sudden electric shock had </p><p>smitten him. He babbled some incoherent words, </p><p>and went hastily to a small closet where he usually </p><p>kept his liquors. Although astonished at his emo- </p><p>tion, I was too preoccupied with my own idea to pay </p><p>much attention to anything else. </p><p> “You say truly when you call Madame Vulpes a</p><p>devil of a woman,” I continued. “Simon, she told </p><p>me wonderful things to-night, or rather was the </p><p>means of telling me wonderful things. Ah! if I </p><p>could only get a diamond that weighed one hundred </p><p>and forty carats!” </p><p> Scarcely had the sigh with which I uttered this</p><p>desire died upon my lips, when Simon, with the </p><p>aspect of a wild beast, glared at me savagely, and, </p><p>rushing to the mantelpiece, where some foreign </p><p>weapons hung on the wall, caught up a Malay </p><p>creese, and brandished it furiously before him. </p><p> “No!” he cried in French, into which he always</p><p>broke when excited. “No! you shall not have it! </p><p>You are perfidious! You have consulted with that </p><p>demon, and desire my treasure! But I shall die </p><p>first! Me! I am brave! You cannot make me </p><p>fear!” </p><p>The Dealer Is Suspicious. </p><p>ALL this, uttered in a loud voice trembling with </p><p>excitement, astounded me. I saw at a glance </p><p>that I had accidentally trodden upon the edges of </p><p>Simon’s secret, whatever it was. It was necessary </p><p>to reassure him. </p><p> “My dear Simon,” I said, “I am entirely at a loss</p><p>to know what you mean. I went to Madame Vulpes </p><p>to consult her on a scientific problem, to the solution </p><p>of which I discovered that a diamond of the size I </p><p>just mentioned was necessary. You were never al- </p><p>luded to during the evening, nor, so far as I was </p><p>concerned, even thought of. What can be the mean- </p><p>ing of this outburst? If you happen to have a set </p><p>of valuable diamonds in your possession, you need </p><p>fear nothing from me. The diamond which I re- </p><p>quire you could not possess; or, if you did possess </p><p>dt, you would not be living here.” </p><p> Something in my tone must have completely reas-</p><p>isured him; for his expression immediately changed </p><p>to a sort of constrained merriment, combined, how- </p><p>ever, with a certain suspicious attention to my </p><p>movements. He laughed, and said that I must bear </p><p>with him; that he was at certain moments subject </p><p>to a speoies of vertigo, which betrayed itself in </p><p>incoherent speeches, and that the attacks passed off </p><p>as rapidly as they came. He put his weapon aside </p><p>while making this explanation, and endeavored, with </p><p>some success, to assume a more cheerful air. </p><p> All this did not impose on me in the least. I was</p><p>too much accustomed to analytical labors to be </p><p>baffled by so flimsy a veil. I determined to probe the </p><p>mystery to the bottom. </p><p> “Simon,” I said gayly, “let us forget all this over</p><p>a bottle of Burgundy. I have a case of Lausseure’s </p><p>Clos Vougeot down-stairs, fragrant with the odors </p><p>and ruddy with the sunlight of the Cote d’Or. Let </p><p>us have up a couple of bottles. What say you?” </p><p>“With all my heart,” answered Simon, smilingly. </p><p>I produced the wine and we seated ourselves to </p><p>drink. It was of a famous vintage, that of 1848, a </p><p>year when war and wine throve together,—and its </p><p>pure but powerful juice seemed to impart renewed </p><p>vitality to the system. By the time we had half </p><p>finished the second bottle, Simon’s head, which I </p><p>knew was a weak one, had begun to yield, while I </p><p>remained calm as ever, only that every draught </p><p>seemed to send a flush of vigor through my limbs. </p><p>Simon’s utterance became more and more indistinct. </p><p>He took to singing French chansons of a not very </p><p>moral tendency. I rose suddenly from the table just </p><p>at the conclusion of one of those incoherent </p><p>verses, and, fixing my eyes on him with a quiet </p><p>smile, said: “Simon, I have deceived you. I learned </p><p>your secret this evening. You may as well be frank </p><p>with me. Mrs. Vulpes, or rather one of her spirits, </p><p>told me all.” </p><p>A Wonderful Rose Diamond </p><p>HE started with horror. His intoxication seemed </p><p>for the moment to fade away, and he made a </p><p>movement towards the weapon that he had a short </p><p>time before laid down. I stopped him with my </p><p>hand. </p><p> “Monster” he cried, passionately, “I am ruined!</p><p>What shall I do? You shall never have it! I swear </p><p>by my mother!” </p><p> “I don’t want it,” I said; “rest secure, but be</p><p>frank with me. Tell me all about it.” </p><p> The drunkenness began to return. He protested</p><p>with maudlin earnestness that I was entirely mis- </p><p>taken,—that I was intoxicated; then asked me to </p><p>swear eternal secrecy, and promised to disclose the </p><p>mystery to me. I pledged myself, of course, to all. </p><p>With an uneasy look in his eyes, and hands unsteady </p><p>with drink and nervousness, he drew a small case </p><p>from his breast and opened it. Heavens! How the </p><p>mild lamp-light was shivered into a thousand pris- </p><p>matic arrows, as it fell upon a vast rose-diamond </p><p>that glittered in the case! I was no judge of dia- </p><p>monds, but I saw at a glance that this was a gem of </p><p>rare size and purity. I looked at Simon with won- </p><p>der, and—must I confess it?—with envy. How </p><p>could he have obtained this treasure? In reply to </p><p>my questions, I could just gather from his drunken </p><p>statements (of which, I fancy, half the incoherence </p><p>was affected) that he had been superintending a </p><p>gang of slaves engaged in diamond-washing in </p><p>Brazil; that he had seen one of them secrete a </p><p>diamond, but, instead of informing his employers, </p><p>had quietly watched the negro until he saw him </p><p>bury his treasure; that he had dug it up and fled </p><p>with it, but that as yet he was afraid to attempt to </p><p>dispose of it publicly,—so valuable a gem being </p><p>almost certain to attract too much attention to its </p><p>840 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>owner’s antecedents,~and he had not been able to </p><p>discover any of those obscure channels by which </p><p>such matters are conveyed away safely. He added, </p><p>that, in accordance with the oriental practice* he </p><p>had named his diamond with the fanciful title of </p><p>“The Eye of Morning.” </p><p> While Simon was relating this to me, I regarded</p><p>the great diamond attentively. Never had I beheld </p><p>anything so beautiful. All the glories of light, ever </p><p>imagined or described, seemed to pulsate in its </p><p>crystalline chambers. Its weight, as I learned from </p><p>Simon, was exactly one hundred and forty carats. </p><p>Here was an amazing coincidence. The hand of </p><p>destiny seemed in it. On the very evening when the </p><p>spirit of Leeuwenhoek communicatee to me the great </p><p>secret of the microscope, the priceless means which </p><p>he directs me to employ start up within my easy </p><p>reach! I determined, with the most perfect delib- </p><p>eration, to possess myself of Simon's diamond. </p><p>He Murders the Dealer </p><p>I SAT opposite to him while he nodded over his </p><p>glass, and calmly revolved the whole affair. I </p><p>did not for an instant contemplate so foolish an act </p><p>as a common theft, which would of course be dis- </p><p>covered, or at least necessitate flight and conceal- </p><p>ment, all of which must interfere with my scientific </p><p>plans. There was but one step to be taken,—to kill </p><p>Simon. After all, what was the life of a little ped- </p><p>dling Jew, in comparison with the interests of </p><p>science? Human beings are taken every day from </p><p>the condemned prisons to be experimented on by </p><p>surgeons. This man, Simon, was by his own con- </p><p>fession a criminal, a robber, and I believed on my </p><p>soul a murderer. He deserved death quite as much </p><p>as any felon condemned by the laws: why should </p><p>not I, like the government, contrive that his punish- </p><p>ment should contribute to the progress of human </p><p>knowledge? </p><p> The means for accomplishing everything I de-</p><p>sired lay within my reach. There stood upon the </p><p>mantelpiece a bottle half full of French laudanum. </p><p>Simon was so occupied with his diamond, which I </p><p>had just restored to him, that it was an affair of </p><p>no difficulty to drug his glass. In a quarter of an </p><p>hoar he was in a profound sleep. </p><p> I now opened his waistcoat, took the diamond</p><p>from the inner pocket in which he had placed it, </p><p>and removed him to the bed, on which I laid him </p><p>so that his feet hung down over the edge. I had </p><p>possessed myself of the Malay creese, which I held</p><p>in my right hand, while with the other I discovered </p><p>as accurately as I could by pulsation the exact </p><p>locality of the heart. It was essential that all the </p><p>aspects of his death should lead to the surmise of </p><p>self-murder. I calculated the exact angle at which </p><p>it was probable that the weapon, if levelled by </p><p>Simon’s own hand, would enter his breast; then with </p><p>one powerful blow I thrust it up to the hilt in the </p><p>very spot which I desired to penetrate. A con- </p><p>vulsive thrill ran through Simon’s limbs. I heard </p><p>a smothered sound issue from his throat, precisely </p><p>like the bursting of a large air-bubble, sent up by </p><p>a diver, when it reaches the surface of the water; </p><p>he turned half round on his side, and, as if to assist </p><p>my plans more effectually, his right hand, moved </p><p>by some mere spasmodic impulse, clasped the han- </p><p>dle of the creese, which it remained holding with </p><p>extraordinary muscular tenacity. Beyond this </p><p>there was no apparent struggle. The laudanum, I </p><p>presume, paralyzed the usual nervous action. He </p><p>must have died instantly. </p><p> There was yet something to be done. To make</p><p>it certain that all suspicion of the act should be </p><p>diverted from any inhabitant of the house to Simon </p><p>himself, it was necessary that the door should be </p><p>found in the morning locked on the inside. How to </p><p>do this, and afterwards escape myself? Not by the </p><p>window; that was a physical impossibility. Besides, </p><p>I was determined that the windows also should be </p><p>found bolted. The solution was simple enough. I </p><p>descended softly to my own room for a peculiar in- </p><p>strument which I had used for holding small slip- </p><p>pery substances, such as minute spheres of glass, </p><p>etc. This instrument was nothing more than a </p><p>long slender hand-vice, with a very powerful grip, </p><p>and a considerable leverage, which last was acci- </p><p>dentally owing to the shape of the handle. Nothing </p><p>was simpler than, when the key was in the lock, to </p><p>seize the end of its stem in this vice, through the </p><p>keyhole, from the outside, and so lock the door. </p><p>Previously, however, to doing this, I burned a num- </p><p>ber of papers on Simon’s hearth. Suicides almost </p><p>always burn papers before they destroy themselves. </p><p>I also emptied some more laudanum into Simon's </p><p>glasB,—having first removed from it all traces of </p><p>wine,—cleaned the other wine-glass, and brought </p><p>the bottles away with me. If traces of two persons </p><p>drinking had been found in the room, the question </p><p>naturally would have arisen, Who was the second? </p><p>Besides, the wine-bottles might have been identified </p><p>as belonging to me. The laudanum I poured out to </p><p>account for its presence in his stomach, in case of a </p><p>post-mortem examination. The theory naturally </p><p>would be, that he first intended to poison himself, </p><p>but, after swallowing a little of the drug, was either </p><p>disgusted with its taste, or changed his mind from</p><p>other motives, and chose the dagger. These </p><p>arrangements made, I walked out, leaving the gas </p><p>burning, locked the door with my vice, and went to </p><p>bed. </p><p>A Verdict of Suicide </p><p>SIMON’S death was not discovered until nearly </p><p>three in the afternoon. The servant, astonished </p><p>at seeing the gas burning,—the light streaming on </p><p>the dark landing from under the door,—peeped </p><p>through the keyhole and saw Simon on the bed. </p><p>She gave the alarm. The door was burst open, and </p><p>the neighborhood was in a fever of excitement. </p><p> Every one in the house was arrested, myself in-</p><p>cluded. There was an inquest; but no clew to his </p><p>death beyond that of suicide could be obtained. </p><p>Curiously enough, he had made several speeches to </p><p>his friends the preceding week, that seemed to point </p><p>to self-destruction. One gentleman swore that </p><p>Simon had said in his presence that “he was tired of </p><p>life.” His landlord affirmed that Simon, when pay- </p><p>ing him his last month’s rent, remarked that “he </p><p>should not pay him rent much longer." All the </p><p>other evidence corresponded,—the door locked in- </p><p>side, the position of the corpse, the burnt papers. </p><p>As I anticipated, no one knew of the possession of </p><p>the diamond by Simon, so that no motive was sug- </p><p>gested for his murder. The jury, after a prolonged </p><p>(examination, brought in the usual verdict, and the </p><p>THE DIAMOND LENS </p><p>841 </p><p>neighborhood once more settled down into its ac- </p><p>customed quiet. </p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>Animula </p><p>THE three months succeeding Simon’s catas- </p><p>trophe I devoted night and day to my diamond </p><p>lens. I had constructed a vast galvanic bat- </p><p>tery, composed of nearly two thousand pairs of </p><p>plates,—a higher power I dared not use, lest the </p><p>diamond should be calcined. By means of this </p><p>enormous engine I was enabled to send a powerful </p><p>current of electricity continually through my great </p><p>diamond, which it seemed to me gained in lustre </p><p>every day. At the expiration of a month I com- </p><p>menced the grinding and polishing of the lens, a </p><p>work of intense toil and exquisite delicacy. The </p><p>great density of the stone, and the care required to </p><p>be taken with the curvatures of the surfaces of the </p><p>lens, rendered the labor the severest and most har- </p><p>assing that I had yet undergone. </p><p> At last the eventful moment came; the lens was</p><p>completed. I stood trembling on the threshold of </p><p>new worlds. I had the realization of Alexander’s </p><p>famous wish before me. The lens lay on the table, </p><p>ready to be placed upon its platform. My hand </p><p>fairly shook a3 I enveloped a drop of water with a </p><p>thin coating of oil of turpentine, preparatory to its </p><p>examination,—a process necessary in order to pre- </p><p>vent the rapid evaporation of the water. I now </p><p>placed the drop on a thin slip of glass under the </p><p>lens, and throwing upon it, by the combined aid of a </p><p>prism and a mirror, a powerful stream of light, I </p><p>approached my eye to the minute hole drilled </p><p>through the axis of the lens. For an instant I saw </p><p>nothing save what seemed to be an illuminated </p><p>chaos, a vast luminous abyss. A pure white light, </p><p>cloudless and serene, and seemingly limitless as </p><p>space itself, was my first impression. Gently, and </p><p>with the greatest care, I depressed the lens a few </p><p>hair’s-breadths. The wondrous illumination still </p><p>continued, but as the lens approached the object a </p><p>scene of indescribable beauty was unfolded to my </p><p>view. </p><p> I seemed to gaze upon a vast space, the limits of</p><p>which extended far beyond my vision. An atmos- </p><p>phere of magical luminousness permeated the en- </p><p>tire field of view. I was amazed to see no trace of </p><p>animalculous life. Not a living thing, apparently, </p><p>inhabited that dazzling expanse. I comprehended in- </p><p>stantly that, by the wondrous power of my lens, I </p><p>had penetrated beyond the grosser particles of</p><p>aqueous matter, beyond the realms of infusoria and </p><p>protozoa, down to the original gaseous globule, into </p><p>whose luminous interior I was gazing, as into an al- </p><p>most boundless dome filled with 3 supernatural ra- </p><p>diance. </p><p>The First Visions of Beauty </p><p>IT was, however, no brilliant void into which I </p><p>looked. On every side I beheld beautiful or- </p><p>ganic forms, of unknown texture, and colored with </p><p>the most enchanting hues. These forms presented </p><p>the appearance of what might be called, for want </p><p>of a more specific definition, foliated clouds of the </p><p>highest rarity; that is, they undulated and broke in- </p><p>to vegetable formation!*, and wprp tinpprt with splen- </p><p>dors compared with which the gilding of our autumn </p><p>woodlands is as dross compared with gold. Far </p><p>away into the illimitable distance stretched long </p><p>avenues of these gaseous forests, dimly transparent, </p><p>and painted with prismatic hues of unimaginable </p><p>brilliancy. The pendent branches waved along the </p><p>fluid glades until every vista seemed to break </p><p>through half-lucent ranks of many-colored drooping </p><p>silken pennons. What seemed to be either fruits or </p><p>flowers, pied with a thousand hues, lustrous and </p><p>ever varying, bubbled from the crowns of this fairy </p><p>foliage. No hills, no lakes, no rivers, no forms ani- </p><p>mate or inanimate, were to be seen, save those vast </p><p>auroral copses that floated serenely in the luminous </p><p>stillness, with leaves and fruits and flowers gleam- </p><p>ing with unknown fires, unrealizable by mere ima- </p><p>gination. </p><p> How strange, I thought, that this sphere should</p><p>be thus condemned to solitude! I had hoped, at </p><p>least, to discover some new form of animal life,— </p><p>perhaps of a lower class than any with which we </p><p>are at present acquainted, but still, some living or- </p><p>ganism. I found my newly discovered world, if I </p><p>may so speak, a beautiful chromatic desert. </p><p> While I was speculating on the singular arrange-</p><p>ments of the internal economy of Nature, with </p><p>which she so frequently splinters into atoms our </p><p>most compact theories, I thought I beheld a form </p><p>moving slowly through the glades of one of the pris- </p><p>matic forests. I looked more attentively, and found </p><p>that I was not mistaken. Words cannot depict the </p><p>anxiety with which I awaited the nearer approach </p><p>of this mysterious object. Was it merely some in- </p><p>animate substance, held in suspense in the atten- </p><p>uated atmosphere of the globule? Or was it an ani- </p><p>mal endowed with vitality and motion? It ap- </p><p>proached, flitting behind the gauzy, colored veils of </p><p>cloud-foliage, for seconds dimly revealed, then van- </p><p>ishing. At last the violet pennon3 that trailed</p><p>nearest to me vibrated; they were gently pushed </p><p>aside, and the form floated out into the broad light. </p><p>The Glorious Animula </p><p>tT was a female human shape. When I say hu- </p><p>man, I mean it possessed the outlines of hu- </p><p>manity,—but there the analogy ends. Its adorable </p><p>beauty lifted it illimitable heights beyond the love- </p><p>liest daughter of Adam. </p><p> I cannot, I dare not, attempt to inventory the</p><p>charms of this divine revelation of perfect beauty. </p><p>Those eyes of mystic violet, dewy and serene, evade </p><p>my words. Her long, lustrous hair following her </p><p>glorious head in a golden wake* like the track sown </p><p>in heaven by a falling star, seems to quench my most </p><p>burning phrases with its splendors. If all the bees </p><p>of Hybla nestled upon my lips, they would still sing </p><p>but hoarsely the wondrous harmonies of outline that </p><p>enclosed her form. </p><p> She swept out from between the rainbow-curtains</p><p>of the cloud-trees into the broad sea of light that lay </p><p>beyond. Her motions were those of some graceful </p><p>naiad, cleaving, by a mere effort of her will, the </p><p>clear, unruffled waters that fill the chambers of the </p><p>sea. She floated forth with the serene grace of a </p><p>frail bubble ascending through the still atmosphere </p><p>of a June day. The perfect roundness of her limbs </p><p>formed suave and enchanting curves.

This, indeed, was a pleasure cheaply pur- </p><p>chased at any price. What cared I, if I had waded </p><p>to the portal of this wonder through another’s </p><p>blood? I would have given my own to enjoy one </p><p>such moment of intoxication and delight. </p><p> Breathless with gazing on this lovely wonder, and</p><p>forgetful for an instant of everything save her pres- </p><p>ence, I withdrew my eye from the microscope </p><p>eagerly,—alas! As my gaze fell on the thin slide </p><p>that lay beneath my instrument, the bright light </p><p>from mirror and from prism sparkled on a colorless </p><p>drop of water! There, in that tiny bead of dew, </p><p>this beautiful being was forever imprisoned. The </p><p>planet Neptune was not more distant from me than </p><p>she. I hastened once more to apply my eye to the </p><p>microscope. </p><p> Animula (let me now call her by that dear name</p><p>which I subsequently bestowed on her) had changed </p><p>her position. She had again approached the won- </p><p>drous forest, and was gazing earnestly upwards. </p><p>Presently one of the trees—as I must call them— </p><p>unfolded a long ciliary process, with which it seized </p><p>one of the gleaming fruits that glittered on its sum- </p><p>mit, and, sweeping slowly down, held it within reach </p><p>of Animula. The sylph took it in her delicate hand </p><p>and began to eat. My attention was so entirely </p><p>absorbed by her, that I could not apply myself to </p><p>the task of determining whether this singular plant </p><p>was or was not instinct with volition. </p><p>More About His Love, Animula </p><p>I WATCHED her, with the most profound at- </p><p>tention as she made her repast, The suppleness </p><p>of her motions sent a thrill of delight through my </p><p>frame; my heart beat madly as she turned her </p><p>beautiful eyes in the direction of the spot in which I </p><p>stood. What would I not have given to have had </p><p>the power to precipitate myself into that luminous </p><p>ocean, and float with her through those groves of </p><p>purple and gold! While I was thus breathlessly </p><p>following her every movement, she suddenly started, </p><p>seemed to listen for a moment, and then cleaving </p><p>the brilliant ether in which she was floating, like a </p><p>flash^oftlight, pierced through the opaline forest, </p><p>and disappeared. </p><p> Instantly a series of the most singular sensations</p><p>attacked me. It seemed as if I had suddenly gone </p><p>blind. The luminous sphere was still before me, but </p><p>my daylight had vanished. What caused this sud- </p><p>den disappearance ? Had she a lover or a husband ?</p><p>Yes, that was the solution! Some signal from a </p><p>happy fellow-being had vibrated through the </p><p>avenues of the forest, and she had obeyed the sum- </p><p>mons. </p><p> The agony of my sensations, as I arrived at this</p><p>conclusion, startled me. I tried to reject the con- </p><p>viction that my reason forced upon me. I battled </p><p>against the fatal conclusion,—but in vain. It was </p><p>so. I had no escape from it. I loved an animalcule! </p><p> It is true that, thanks to the marvellous power of</p><p>my microscope, she appeared of human proportions. </p><p>Instead of presenting the revolting aspect of the </p><p>coarser creatures, that live and struggle and die, in </p><p>the more easily resolvable portions of the water- </p><p>drop, she was fair and delicate and of surpassing </p><p>beauty. But of what account was all that? Every </p><p>time that my eye was withdrawn from the instru- </p><p>ment, it fell on a miserable drop of water, within </p><p>which, I must be content to know, dwelt all that </p><p>could make my life lovely. </p><p> Could she but see me once! Could I for one mo-</p><p>ment pierce the mystical walls that so inexorably </p><p>rose to separate us, and whisper all that filled my </p><p>soul, I might consent to be satisfied for the rest of </p><p>my life with the knowledge of her remote sympathy. </p><p>It would be something to have established even the </p><p>faintest personal link to bind us together,—to know </p><p>that at times, when roaming through those en- </p><p>chanted glades, she might think of the wonderful </p><p>stranger, who had broken the monotony of her life </p><p>with his presence, and left a gentle memory in her </p><p>heart! </p><p> But it could not be. No invention of which human</p><p>intellect was capable could# break down the barriers </p><p>that nature had erected. I*might feast my soul upon </p><p>her wondrous beauty, yet she must always remain </p><p>ignorant of the adoring eyes that day and night </p><p>gazed upon her, and, even when closed, beheld her </p><p>in dreams. With a bitter cry of anguish I fled from </p><p>the room, and, flinging myself on my bed, sobbed </p><p>myself to sleep like a child. </p><p>CHAPTER VI </p><p>The Spilling of the Cup </p><p>1 AROSE the next morning almost at daybreak, </p><p>and rushed to my microscope. I trembled as I </p><p>sought the luminous world in miniature that </p><p>contained my all. Animula was there. I had left </p><p>the gas-lamp, surrounded by its moderators, burn- </p><p>ing, when I went to bed the night before. I found </p><p>the sylph bathing, as it were, with an expression of</p><p>pleasure animating her features, in the brilliant </p><p>light which surrounded her. She tossed her lus- </p><p>trous golden hair over her shoulders with innocent </p><p>coquetry. She lay at full length in the transparent </p><p>medium, in which she supported herself with ease, </p><p>and gambolled with the enchanting grace that the </p><p>nymph Salamacis might have exhibited when she </p><p>sought to conquer the modest Hermaphroditus. I </p><p>tried an experiment to satisfy myself if her powers </p><p>of reflection were developed. I lessened the lamp- </p><p>light considerably. By the dim light that remained, </p><p>I could see an expression of pain flit across her face. </p><p>She looked upward suddenly, and her brows coi£ </p><p>tracted. I flooded the stage of the microscope again </p><p>with a full stream of light, and her whole expression </p><p>changed. She sprang forward like some substance </p><p>deprived of all weight. Her eyes sparkled and her </p><p>lips moved. Ah! if science had only the means of </p><p>conducting and reduplicating sounds, as it does the </p><p>rays of light, what carols of happiness would then </p><p>have entranced my ears! what jubilant hymns to </p><p>Adonis would have thrilled the illumined air! </p><p> I now comprehended how it was that the Count</p><p>de Gabalis peopled his mystic world with sylphs,—■ </p><p>beautiful beings whose breath of life was lambent </p><p>fire, and who sported forever in regions of purest </p><p>ether and purest light. The Rosicrucian had an- </p><p>ticipated the wonder that I had practically realized. </p><p>The Passion Grows Stronger </p><p>HOW long this worship of my strange divinity </p><p>went on thus I scarcely know. I lost all note of </p><p>time. All da; from early dawn, and far into the </p><p>THE DIAMOND LENS </p><p>843 </p><p>night, I was to be found peering through that won- </p><p>derful lens. I saw no one, went nowhere, and scarce </p><p>allowed myself sufficient time for my meals. My </p><p>whole life was absorbed in contemplation as rapt as </p><p>that of any of the Romish saints. Every hour that </p><p>I gazed upon the divine form strengthened my pas- </p><p>sion,—a passion that was always overshadowed by </p><p>the maddening conviction, that, although I could </p><p>gaze on her at will, she never, never could behold </p><p>me! </p><p> At length, I grew so pale and emaciated, from</p><p>want of rest, and continual brooding over my insane </p><p>love and its cruel conditions, that I determined to </p><p>make some effort to wean myself from it. “Come,” </p><p>I said, “this is at best but a fantasy. Your imagina- </p><p>tion has bestowed on Animula charms which in </p><p>reality she does not possess. Seclusion from fe- </p><p>male society has produced this morbid condition </p><p>of mind. Compare her with the beautiful women </p><p>of your own world, and this false enchantment will </p><p>vanish.” </p><p>The Dancer On the Stage at Niblo’s Garden </p><p>I LOOKED over the newspapers by chance. Therg </p><p>I beheld the advertisement of a celebrated dart- </p><p>seuse who appeared nightly at Niblo’s*. The Sig- </p><p>norina Caradolce had the reputation of being the </p><p>most beautiful as well as the most graceful woman </p><p>in the world. I instantly dressed and went to the </p><p>theatre. </p><p> The curtain drew up. The usual semicircle of</p><p>fairies in white muslin were standing on the right </p><p>toe around the enamelled flower-bank, of green can- </p><p>vas, on which the belated prince was sleeping. Sud- </p><p>denly a flute is heard. The fairies start. The trees </p><p>open, the fairies all stand on the left toe, and the </p><p>queen enters. It was the Signorina. She bounded </p><p>forward amid thunders of applause, and, lighting </p><p>on one foot, remained poised in air. Heavens! was </p><p>this the great enchantress that had drawn monarchs </p><p>at her chariot-wheels ? Those heavy muscular limbs, </p><p>those thick ankles, those cavernous eyes, that stereo- </p><p>typed smile, those crudely painted cheeks! Where </p><p>were the vermeil blooms, the liquid expressive eyes, </p><p>the harmonious limbs of Animula? </p><p> The Signorina danced. What gross, discordant</p><p>movements! The play of her limbs was all false and </p><p>artificial. Her bounds were painful athletic efforts; </p><p>her poses were angular and distressed the eye. I </p><p>could bear it no longer; with an exclamation of dis- </p><p>gust that drew every eye upon me, I rose from my</p><p>seat in the very middle of the Signorina's pas-de- </p><p>fascination, and abruptly quitted the house. </p><p> I hastened home to feast my eyes once more on</p><p>the lovely form of my sylph. I felt that henceforth </p><p>to combat this passion would be impossible. I ap- </p><p>plied my eye to the lens. Animula was there,—but </p><p>what could have happened? Some terrible change </p><p>seemed to have taken place during my absence. </p><p>Some secret grief seemed to cloud the lovely fea- </p><p>tures of her I gazed upon. Her face had grown thin </p><p>and haggard; her limbs trailed heavily; the won- </p><p>drous lustre of her golden hair had faded. She was </p><p>ill!—ill, and I could not assist her! I believe at </p><p>that moment I would have gladly forfeited all claims </p><p>to my human birthright, if I could only have been </p><p>dwarfed to the size of an animalcule, and permitted </p><p>to console her from whom fate had forever divided </p><p>me. </p><p> I racked my brain for the solution of this mys-</p><p>tery. What was it that afflicted the sylph? She </p><p>seemed to suffer intense pain. Her features con- </p><p>tracted, and she even writhed, as if with some in- </p><p>ternal agony. The wondrous forests appeared also </p><p>to have lost half their beauty. Their hues were dim </p><p>and in some places faded away altogether. I watched </p><p>Animula for hours with a breaking heart, and she </p><p>seemed absolutely to wither away under my very </p><p>eye. Suddenly I remembered that I had not looked </p><p>at the water-drop for several days. In fact, I hated </p><p>to see it; for it reminded me of the natural barrier </p><p>between Animula and myself. I hurriedly looked </p><p>down on the stage of the microscope. The slide was </p><p>still there,—but, great heavens! the water-drop had </p><p>vanished 1 The awful truth burst upon me; it had </p><p>evaporated, until it had become so minute as to be </p><p>invisible to the naked eye; I had been gazing on its </p><p>last atom, the one that contained Animula,—and </p><p>she was dying! </p><p>The Disappearance of Animulai </p><p>I rushed again to the front of the lens, and looked </p><p>through. Alas! the last agony had seized her. </p><p>The rainbow-hued forests had all melted away, and </p><p>Animula lay struggling feebly in what seemed to </p><p>be a spot of dim light. Ah! the sight was horrible: </p><p>the limbs once so round and lovely shrivelling up </p><p>into nothings; the eyes—those eyes that shone like </p><p>heavens—being quenched into black dust; the lus- </p><p>trous golden hair now lank and discolored. The last </p><p>throe came. I beheld that final struggle of the </p><p>blackening form—and I fainted. </p><p> When I awoke out of a trance of many hours, I</p><p>found myself lying amid the wreck of my instru-</p><p>ment, myself as shattered in mind and body as it. I </p><p>crawled feebly to my bed, from which I did not rise </p><p>for months. </p><p> They say now that I am mad; but they are mis-</p><p>taken. I am poor, for I have neither the heart nor </p><p>the will to work; all my money is spent, and I live on </p><p>charity. Young men’s associations that love a joke </p><p>invite me to lecture on Optics before them, for </p><p>which they pay me, and laugh at me while I lecture. </p><p>“Linley, the mad microscopist,” is the name I go by. </p><p>I suppose that I talk incoherently while I lecture. </p><p>Who could talk sense when his brain is haunted by </p><p>such ghastly memories, while ever and anon among </p><p>the shapes of death I behold the radiant form of my </p><p>lost Animula! </p><p>•Niblo’s Garden was a famous old-time New York theatre.—Ed. </p><p> THE END</p><p> In our next issue we are starting a new department entitled "DISCUSSIONS”</p><p> In this department readers are invited to discuss scientifiction and their impressions</p><p> of this new literature, in personal chats with the editors.</p><p>Second Deluge </p><p>~ Qarrett tfServiss ~ </p><p>Author of “The Moon Metal,” “A Columbus of Space,” etc. </p><p> • • and	could comprehend whit It vnw, the battleship crashed, prow-on, Into the eteel-rlbb.d walk.

N otwitiistwnding </p><p>he is reviled and scoffed at for this announcement, </p><p>he placards New York with posters, calling to all </p><p>to harken to his prophecy and to prepare for the </p><p>coming flood. For his own safety he begins the </p><p>building of an enormous ark and barely has it com- </p><p>pleted when reports are flashed about the world </p><p>that the loaters are actually beginning to rise. </p><p> Suddenly, in midday, the world grew dark and</p><p>people became terror-stricken. The rain descended </p><p>from alt invisible source and the waters rose. Liter- </p><p>ally, the world sweat. But the flood as quickly </p><p>abated when light came again, and great was the </p><p>ridicule heaped upon Cosmo and his ark, but the </p><p>scientist proceeded with the building of his mam- </p><p>moth vessel and began to gather the people he had </p><p>chosen to accompany him, and the animals as well, </p><p>from all quarters of the earth. Again came the </p><p>darkness upon the land and once more the world </p><p>sweat. About his ark Cosmo had' placed electric </p><p>wires, and when the maddened populace, now terri- </p><p>fied beyond measure, attempted to storm the ark, </p><p>hundreds fell to the ground, shocked, and many were </p><p>killed. </p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p> By GARRETT P. SERVISS</p><p> Part II</p><p>OSMO’S warning to them of the neces- </p><p>sity of secrecy was superfluous, for the </p><p>selfishness of human nature never had </p><p>a better illustration than they afforded. </p><p>The lucky recipients of the invita- </p><p>tions stole away without a word of farewell, cir- </p><p>cumspectly disappearing, generally at night, and </p><p>often in disguise; and when the attack occurred on </p><p>the ark, there were, behind the port-holes, many </p><p>anxious eyes cautiously staring out and recogniz- </p><p>ing familiar faces in the mob, while the owners of </p><p>those eyes trembled in their ahoe3 lest their </p><p>friends might succeed in forcing an entrance. Af- </p><p>ter all, it was to be doubted if Cosmo Vers&amp;l, with </p><p>all his vigilance, had succeeded in collecting a com- </p><p>pany representing anything above the average </p><p>quality of the race. </p><p> But there was one —————</p><p>thing that did great </p><p>credit to his heart. When </p><p>he found that he had</p><p>room unoccupied, before </p><p>adding to his lists he con- </p><p>sented to take more than </p><p>two children in a family. </p><p>It was an immense' relief, </p><p>for—it must be recorded </p><p>—there were some who, </p><p>in order to qualify them- </p><p>selves, had actually aban- </p><p>doned members of their _ </p><p>own families! Let it also </p><p>be said, however, that .	,</p><p>many, when they found that the conditions impos- </p><p>ed were inexorable, and that they could only save </p><p>themselves by leaving behind others as dear to </p><p>them as their own lives, indignantly refused, and </p><p>most of these did not even reply to the invitations. </p><p> It was another indication of Cosmo’s real hu-</p><p>manity, as well as of his shrewdness, that, as far </p><p>as they were known, and could be reached, the </p><p>persons who had thus remained true to the best </p><p>instincts of nature were the first to receive a </p><p>second invitation, with an injunction to bring their </p><p>entire families. So it happened that, after all, </p><p> QLOWLY the -world is sinking below the rising waters.</p><p> Those who have not as yet bevti drowned admit that</p><p> Cosmo Vers&amp;l had been right, but it is now too late.</p><p> The watery nebula is engulfing the earth, and the waters</p><p> will rise until the entire surface of the globe is covered</p><p> to such an extent that even the highest mountain tops will</p><p> be submerged.</p><p> In the meanwhile, Cosmo Versdl’s ark is drifting over</p><p> new, uncharted oceans. But through a strange freak of</p><p> the nebula, it seems that after all Vers6l was not cor-</p><p> rect in his calculations, because suddenly the flood stops.</p><p> Was Cosmo Versal really wrong? And will the flood</p><p> subside? These are the vital questions that engross those</p><p> who have fled to the mountain tops.</p><p>there were aged men and women, as well as chil- </p><p>dren-in-arras, mingled in that remarkable assem- </p><p>blage. </p><p> It will be recalled that thirteen places had been</p><p>specially reserved, to be filled by Cosmo Versal's </p><p>personal friends. His choice of these revealed an- </p><p>other pleasing side of his mind. He took thirteen </p><p>men and women who had been, in one capacity or </p><p>another, employed for many years in his service. </p><p>Some of them were old family servants that had</p><p>been in his father's house. </p><p> “Every one of these persons,” he said to Joseph</p><p>Smith, “is worth his weight in gold. Their disin- </p><p>terested fidelity to duty is a type of character that </p><p>almost became extinct generations ago, and no </p><p>more valuable leaven could be introduced into the </p><p>society of the future. </p><p>HBHHBHBn Bather than leave them, 1 </p><p>would stay behind myself.” </p><p>Finally there was the </p><p>crew. This comprised </p><p>one hundred and fifty </p><p>members, all of them </p><p>chosen from the body of </p><p>engineers, mechanics, and </p><p>workmen who had been </p><p>employed in the construc- </p><p>tion of the ark. Cosmo </p><p>himself was, of course, the </p><p>commander, but he had </p><p>for his lieutenants skilled </p><p>HWlBmiMlMa mariners, electrical and </p><p>mechanical engineers, and </p><p>men whom he himself had instructed in the peculiar </p><p>duties that would fall to them in the navigation </p><p>and management of the ark, every detail of which </p><p>he had laboriously worked out with a foresight </p><p>that seemed all but superhuman. </p><p> All of the passengers and crew were aboard</p><p>when the baffled mob retreated from Mineola, and </p><p>some,-when that danger was past, wished to de- </p><p>scend to the ground, and go and look at the rising </p><p>waters, which had not yet invaded the neighbor- </p><p>hood. But Cosmo absolutely forbade any depart- </p><p>ures from the ark. The condensation of the nebula, </p><p>845 </p><p>846 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>he declared, was likely to begin any minute, and </p><p>the downpour would be so fierce that a person </p><p>might be drowned in the open field. </p><p> It came even sooner than he had anticipated,</p><p>with the results that we had already noted in New </p><p>York. At first many thought that the ark itself </p><p>would be destroyed, so dreadful was the impact of </p><p>the falling water. The women and children, and </p><p>some of the men, were seized with panic, and </p><p>Cosmo had great difficulty in reassuring them. </p><p> “The flood will not reach us for several hours</p><p>yet,” he said. “The level of the water must rise at </p><p>least a hundred feet more before we shall be afloat. </p><p>Inside here we are perfectly safe. The ark is ex- </p><p>ceedingly strong and absolutely tight. You have </p><p>nothing to fear.” </p><p> Then he ordered an ingenious sound-absorbing</p><p>screen, which he had prepared, to be drawn over </p><p>the great ceiling of the saloon, the effect of which </p><p>was to shut out the awful noise of the water roar- </p><p>ing upon the roof of the ark. A silence that was </p><p>at first startling by contrast to the preceding din </p><p>prevailed as soon as the screen was in place. </p><p> Amid a hush of expectancy, Cosmo now mounted</p><p>a dais at one end of the room. Never before had </p><p>the intellectual superiority of the man seemed so </p><p>evident. His huge “dome of thought,” surmount- </p><p>ing his slight body, dominated the assembly like </p><p>the front of Jove. Chairs near him were occupied </p><p>by Professor Jeremiah Moses, Professor Abel </p><p>Able, Professor Alexander Jones, and the two </p><p>“speculative geniuses” whom he had named to </p><p>Joseph Smith. These were Costak6 Theriad6, of </p><p>Rumania, a tall, dark, high-browed thinker, who </p><p>was engaged in devising ways to extract and recover </p><p>intra-atomic energy; and Sir Wilfred Athelstone, </p><p>whose specialty was bio-chemistry, and who was </p><p>said to have produced amazing results in artificial </p><p>parthenogenesis and the production of new species. </p><p> As soon as attention was concentrated upon him,</p><p>Cosmo Vers&amp;l began to speak. </p><p> “My friends,” he said, “the world around us is</p><p>now sinking beneath a flood that will not be ar- </p><p>rested until America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and </p><p>Australia have disappeared. We stand at the op- </p><p>ening of a new age. You alone who are here as- </p><p>sembled, and your descendants, will constitute the </p><p>population of the new world that is to be. </p><p> “In this ark, which owes its existence to the</p><p>foreseeing eye of science, you will be borne in </p><p>safety upon the bosom of the battling waters, and </p><p>we will disembark upon the first promising land </p><p>that reappears, and begin the plantation and de- </p><p>velopment of a new society of men and women, </p><p>which, I trust, will afford a practical demonstration </p><p>of the principles of eugenics. </p><p> “I have, as far as possible, and as far as the</p><p>pitiful blindness of mankind permitted me to go, </p><p>selected and assembled here representatives of the </p><p>best tendencies of humanity. You are a chosen </p><p>remnant, and the future of this planet depends </p><p>upon you. </p><p> “I have been fortunate in securing the compan-</p><p>ionship of men of science who will be able to lead </p><p>and direct. The ark is fully provisioned for a </p><p>period which must exceed the probable duration of </p><p>the flood. I have taken pains not to overcrowd it, </p><p>and every preparation has been made for any con- </p><p>tingencies which may arise. </p><p> “It is inexpressibly sad to part thus with the</p><p>millions of our fellow beings who would not heed </p><p>the warnings that were lavished upon them; but, </p><p>while our hearts may be rent with the thought, it </p><p>is our duty to cast off the burden of vain regrets </p><p>and concentrate all our energies upon the work be- </p><p>fore us. </p><p> “I salute,” he continued, raising his voice and</p><p>lifting a glass of wine from the little table before </p><p>him, “the world of the past—may its faults be for- </p><p>gotten—and the world of the future—mdfr it rise </p><p>on the wings of science to nobler prospects!” </p><p> He poured out the wine like a libation; and as</p><p>his voice ceased to echo, and he sank into his seat, </p><p>an uncontrollable wave of emotion ran over the </p><p>assembly. Many of the women wept, and the men </p><p>conversed in whispers. After a considerable inter- </p><p>val, during which no one spoke above his breath, </p><p>Professor Abel Abl? arose and said: </p><p> “The gratitude which we owe to this man”— in-</p><p>dicating Cosmo Versal, “can best be expressed, not </p><p>in words, but by acts. He has led us thus far; he </p><p>must continue to lead us to the end. We were </p><p>blind, while he was full of light. It will become us </p><p>hereafter to heed well whatever he may say. I </p><p>now wish to ask if he can foresee where upon the </p><p>re-emerging planet a foothold is first likely to be </p><p>obtained. Where lies our land of promise?” </p><p> “I can answer that question,” Cosmo replied,</p><p>“only in general terms. You are all aware that </p><p>the vast table-land of Tibet is the loftiest region </p><p>upon the globe. In its western part it lies from </p><p>fourteen to seventeen or eighteen thousand feet </p><p>above the ordinary level of the sea. Above it rise </p><p>the greatest mountain-peaks in existence. Here </p><p>the first considerable area is likely to be uncovered. </p><p>It is upon the Pamirs, the ‘Roof of the World,’ </p><p>that we shall probably make our landing.” </p><p> “May I ask,” said Professor Abel Able, “in what</p><p>manner you expect the waters of the flood to be </p><p>withdrawn, after the earth is completely </p><p>drowned?” </p><p> “That,” was the reply, “was one of the funda-</p><p>mental questions that I examined, but I do not </p><p>care to enter into a discussion of it now. I may </p><p>simply say that it is not only upon the disappear- </p><p>ance of the waters that our hopes depend, but upon </p><p>circumstances that I shall endeavor to make clear </p><p>hereafter. The new cradle of mankind will be </p><p>located near the old one, and the roses of the Vale </p><p>of Cashmere will canopy it.” </p><p> Cosmo Vers&amp;l’s words made a profound impres-</p><p>sion upon his hearers, and awoke thoughts that </p><p>carried their minds off into strange reveries. No </p><p>more questions were asked, and gradually the as- </p><p>semblage broke up into groups of interested </p><p>talkers. </p><p> It was near midnight. Cosmo, beckoning Pro-</p><p>fessor Abel Able, Professor Alexander Jones, </p><p>and Professor Jeremiah Moses to accompany him, </p><p>made his way out of the saloon, and, secretly open- </p><p>ing one of the gangway doors, they presently stood, </p><p>sheltering themselves from the pouring rain, in </p><p>a position which enabled them to look toward New </p><p>York. </p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>847 </p><p> Nothing, of course, was visible through the</p><p>downpour; but they were startled at hearing fear- </p><p>ful cries issuing out of the darkness. The rural </p><p>parts of the city, filled with gardens and villas, lay </p><p>round within a quarter of a mile of the ark, and </p><p>the sound, accelerated by the water-charged at- </p><p>mosphere, struck upon their ears with terrible </p><p>distinctness. Sometimes, when a gust of wind </p><p>blew the rain in to their faces, the sound deepened </p><p>into a long, despairing wail, which seemed to be </p><p>borne from afar off, mingled with the roar of the </p><p>descending torrent—the death-cry of the vast me- </p><p>tropolis ! </p><p> “Merciful Heaven, I cannot endure this!” cried</p><p>Professor Moses. </p><p> “Go to my cabin," Cosmo yelled in his ear, “and</p><p>take the others with you. I will join you there in </p><p>a little while. I wish to measure the rate of rise </p><p>of the water." </p><p> They gladly left him, and fled into the interior</p><p>of the ark. Cosmo procured an electric lamp; and </p><p>the moment its light streamed out he perceived </p><p>that the water had already submerged the great </p><p>cradle in which the ark rested, and was beginning </p><p>to creep up the metallic aides. He lowered a grad- </p><p>uated tape into it, provided with an automatic </p><p>register. In a few minutes he had completed his </p><p>task, and then he went to rejoin his late compan- </p><p>ions in his cabin. </p><p> “In about an hour,” he said to them, “we shall</p><p>be afloat. The water is rising at the rate of one- </p><p>thirtieth of an inch per second.” </p><p> “No more than that?” asked Professor Jones</p><p>with an accent of surprise. </p><p> “That is quite enough,” Cosmo replied. “One-</p><p>thi-rtieth of an inch per second means two inches </p><p>in a minute, and ten feet in an hour. In twenty- </p><p>four hours from now the water will stand two hun- </p><p>dred and forty feet above its present level, and </p><p>then only the tallest structures in New York will </p><p>lift their tops above it, if indeed, they are not long </p><p>before overturned by undermining or the force </p><p>of the waves.” </p><p> “But it will be a Jong time before the hills and</p><p>highlands are submerged,” suggested Professor </p><p>Jones. “Are you perfectly sure that the flood will </p><p>cover them?” </p><p> Cosmo Vers&amp;l looked at his interlocutor, and</p><p>slowly shook his head. </p><p> “It is truly a disappointment to me,” he said at</p><p>length, “to find that, even now, remnants of doubt </p><p>cling to your minds. I tell you that the nebula is </p><p>condensing at its maximum rate. It is likely to </p><p>continue to do so for at least four months. In four </p><p>months, at the rate of two inches per minute, the </p><p>level of the water will rise 28,800 feet. There is </p><p>only one peak in the world which is surely known </p><p>to attain a slightly greater height than that— </p><p>Mount Everest, in the Himalayas. Even in a sin- </p><p>gle month the rise will amount to 7,200 feet. That </p><p>Is 611 feet higher than the loftiest mountain in </p><p>the Appalachians. In one month, then, there will </p><p>be nothing visible of North America east of the </p><p>Rockies. And in another month they will have </p><p>gone under.” </p><p> Not another word was said. The three profes-</p><p>sors sat, wide-eyed and open-mouthed, staring at </p><p>Cosmo Versdl, whose bald head was crowned with </p><p>an aureole by the electric light that beamed from </p><p>the ceiling, while with a gold pocket-pencil, he fell </p><p>to figuring upon a sheet of paper. </p><p>CHAPTER X </p><p>The Last Day of New York </p><p>WHILE Cosmo Vers&amp;l was calculating, from </p><p>the measured rise of the water, the rate </p><p>of condensation of the nebula, and finding </p><p>that it added twenty-nine trillion two hundred and </p><p>ninety billion tons to the weight of the earth every </p><p>minute—a computation that seemed to give him </p><p>great mental satisfaction—the metropolis of the </p><p>world, whose nucleus was the island of Manhattan, </p><p>and every other town and city on the globe that </p><p>lay near the ordinary level of the sea, was swiftly </p><p>sinking beneath the swelling flood. </p><p> Everywhere, over all the broad surface of the</p><p>planet, a wail of despair arose from the perishing </p><p>millions, beaten down by the water that poured </p><p>from the unpitying sky. Even on the highlands </p><p>the situation was but little better than in the val- </p><p>leys. The hills seemed to have been turned </p><p>into the crests of cataracts from which tor- </p><p>rents of water rushed down on all sides, stripping </p><p>the soil from the rocks, and sending the stones and </p><p>boulders roaring and leaping into the lowland and </p><p>the gorges. Farmhouses, barns, villas, trees, ani- </p><p>mals, human beings—all were swept away together. </p><p> Only on broad elevated plateaus, where higher</p><p>points rose above the general level, were a few </p><p>of the inhabitants able to find a kind of refuge. By </p><p>seeking these high places, and sheltering them- </p><p>selves as best they could among immovable rocks, </p><p>they succeeded, at least, in delaying their fate. Not- </p><p>withstanding the fact that the atmosphere was filled </p><p>with falling water, they could yet breathe, if they </p><p>kept the rain from striking directly in their faces. </p><p>It was owing to this circumstance, and to some </p><p>extraordinary occurrences which we shall have to </p><p>relate, that the fate of the human race was not </p><p>precisely that which Cosmo Versal had predicted. </p><p> We quitted the scene in New York when the</p><p>shadow of night had just fallen, and turned the </p><p>gloom of the watery atmosphere into impenetrable </p><p>darkness. The events of that dreadful night we </p><p>shall not attempt to depict. When the hours of day- </p><p>light returned, and the sun should have brightened </p><p>over the doomed city, only a faint, phosphorescent </p><p>luminosity filled the sky. It was just sufficient to </p><p>render objects dimly visible. If the enclosing </p><p>nebula had remained in a cloud-like state it would </p><p>have cut off all light, but having condensed into </p><p>rain-drops, which streamed down in parallel lines, </p><p>except when sudden blasts of wind swept them into </p><p>a confused mass, the sunlight was able to penetrate </p><p>through the interstices, aided by the transparency </p><p>of the water, and so a slight but variable illumina- </p><p>tion was produced. </p><p> In this unearthly light many tall structures of ths</p><p>metropolis, which had as yet escaped the effects of </p><p>undermining by the rushing torrents in the streets, </p><p>towered dimly toward the sky, shedding streams of </p><p>water from every cornice. Most of the buildings </p><p>848 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>of only six or eight stories had already been sub- </p><p>merged, with the exception of those that stood on </p><p>high grounds in the upper part of the island, and </p><p>about Spuyten Duyvil. </p><p> In the towers and upper stories of the lofty</p><p>buildings still standing in the heart of the city, </p><p>crowds of unfortunates assembled, gazing with </p><p>horror at the spectacles around them, and wringing </p><p>their hands in helpless despair. When the light </p><p>brightened they could see below them the angry </p><p>water, creeping every instant closer to their places </p><p>of refuge, beaten into foam by the terrible down- </p><p>pour, and sometimes, moved by a mysterious im- </p><p>pulse, rising in sweeping waves which threatened </p><p>to carry everything before them. </p><p> Every few minutes one of the great structures</p><p>would sway, crack, crumble, and go down into the </p><p>seething flood, the cries of the perishing being </p><p>swallowed up in the thunder of the fall. And when </p><p>this occurred within sight of neighboring towers </p><p>yet Intact, men and women could be seen, some with </p><p>children in their arms, madly throwing themselves </p><p>from windows and ledges, seeking quick death now </p><p>that hope was no more! </p><p> Strange and terrible scenes were enacted in the</p><p>neighborhood of what had been the water-fronts. </p><p>Most of the vessels moored there had been virtually </p><p>wrecked by the earlier invasion of the sea. Some </p><p>had been driven upon the shore, others had careened </p><p>and been swamped at their wharves. But a few </p><p>had succeeded in cutting loose in time to get fairly </p><p>afloat. Some tried to go out to sea, but were wreck- </p><p>ed by running against obstacles, or by being swept </p><p>over the Jersey flats. Some met their end by crash- </p><p>ing into the submerged pedestal of the Statue of </p><p>Liberty. Others steered up the course of the Hud- </p><p>son River, but that had become a narrow sea, filled </p><p>with floating and tossing d6bris of every sort, and </p><p>all landmarks being invisible, the luckless naviga- </p><p>tors lost their way, and perished, either through </p><p>collisions with other vessels, or by driving upon a </p><p>rocky shore. </p><p> The fate of the gigantic building containing the</p><p>offices of the municipal government, which, for a </p><p>century, had stood near the ancient City Hall, and </p><p>which had been the culminating achievement of the </p><p>famous epoch of “sky-scrapers,” was a thing so </p><p>singular, and at the same time dramatic, that in a </p><p>narrative dealing with les3 extraordinary events </p><p>than we are obliged to record it would appear alto- </p><p>gether incredible.</p><p> With its two-score lofty stories, and its massive</p><p>base, this wonderful structure rose above the lower </p><p>quarter of the city, and dominated it, like a verit- </p><p>able Tower of Babel, made to defy the flood. Many </p><p>thousands of people evidently regarded it in that </p><p>very light, and they had fled from all quarters, .as </p><p>soon as the great downpour began, to find refuge </p><p>within its mountainous flanks. There were men— </p><p>clerks, merchants, brokers from the down-town </p><p>offices, and women and children from neighboring </p><p>tenements. </p><p> By good chance, but a few weeks before, this</p><p>building had been fitted with a newly invented sys- </p><p>tem of lighting, by which each story was supplied </p><p>with electricity from a small dynamo of its own, </p><p>and so it happened that now the lamps within were </p><p>all aglow, lightening the people's hearts a little </p><p>with their cheering radiance. </p><p> Up and up they climbed, the water ever following</p><p>at their heels, from floor to floor, until ten of the </p><p>great stages were submerged. But there were more </p><p>than twice as many stages yet above, and they </p><p>counted them with unexpiring hope, telling one an- </p><p>other, with the assurance of desperation, that long </p><p>before the flood could attain so stupendous an alti- </p><p>tude the rain would surely cease, and the danger, </p><p>as far as they were concerned, would pass away. </p><p> “See! See!” cries one. “It is stopping! It is</p><p>coming no higher! I’ve been watching that step, </p><p>and the water has stopped! It hasn’t risen for ten </p><p>minutes!” </p><p> “Hurrah! Hurrah!” yells the crowd behind and</p><p>above. And the glad cry is taken up and rever- </p><p>berated from story to story until it bursts wildly </p><p>out into the rain-choked air at the very summit. </p><p> “Hurrah! Hurrah! We are saved! The flood</p><p>has stopped!” </p><p> Men madly embrace each other. Women burst</p><p>into tears and hug their children to their breasts, </p><p>filled with a joy and thankfulness that can find no </p><p>words. </p><p> “You are wrong,” says another man, crouched</p><p>beside him who first spoke. “It has not stopped— </p><p>it is still rising.” </p><p> “What! I tell you it has stopped,” snaps the</p><p>other. “Look at that step! It stopped right below </p><p>it” </p><p> "You’ve been watching the wrong step. It’s ris-</p><p>ing !” </p><p> “You fool! Shut your mouth! I say it has</p><p>stopped.” </p><p> “No, it has not.”</p><p> “It has! It has!"</p><p> “Look at that step, then! See the water just now</p><p>coming over it.” </p><p> The obstinate optimist stares a moment, turns</p><p>pale, and then, with an oath, strikes his more clear- </p><p>headed neighbor in the face! And the excited crowd </p><p>behind, with the blind instinctive feeling that, some- </p><p>how, he has robbed them of the hope which was but </p><p>now as the breath of life to them, strike him and </p><p>curse him, too. </p><p> But he had seen only too clearly.</p><p> With the steady march of fate—two inches a</p><p>minute, as Cosmo Versfil had accurately measured </p><p>it—the water still advances and climbs upward. </p><p> In a little while they were driven to another story,</p><p>and then to another. But hope would not down. </p><p>They could not believe that the glad news, which </p><p>had so recently filled them with joy, was altogether </p><p>false. The water must have stopped rising once; </p><p>it had been seen. Then, it would surely stop again, </p><p>stop to rise no more. </p><p> Poor deluded creatures! With the love of life</p><p>so strong within them, they could not picture, in </p><p>their affrighted minds, the terrible consummation </p><p>to which they were being slowly driven, when, jam- </p><p>med into the narrow chambers dV the very top of the </p><p>mighty structure, their remorseless enemy would </p><p>seize them at last. </p><p> But they were nearer the end than they could</p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>849 </p><p>have imagined even if they had accepted and coolly </p><p>reasoned upon the facts that were so plain before </p><p>them. And, after all, it was not to come upon </p><p>them until after they had fought their way to the </p><p>highest loft and into the last corner. </p><p> A link of this strange chain of fatal events now</p><p>belongs to the spot where the United States Navy </p><p>Yard in Brooklyn once existed. That place was </p><p>sunk deep beneath the waters. All of the cruisers, </p><p>battleships, and other vessels that had been at </p><p>anchor or at moorings there had gone under. One </p><p>only, the boast of the American navy, the uncon- </p><p>querable Uncle Sam, which, in the last great war </p><p>that the world had known, had borne the starry flag </p><p>to victories whose names broke men’s voices and </p><p>filled their eyes with tears of pride, had escaped, </p><p>through the incomparable seamanship of Capt. </p><p>Robert Decatur, who had been her commander for </p><p>thirty years. </p><p> But though the Uncle Sam managed to float upon</p><p>the rising flood, she was unable to get away be- </p><p>cause of the obstructions lodged about the great </p><p>bridges that spanned the East River. A curious </p><p>eddy that the raging currents formed over what </p><p>was once the widest part of that stream kept her </p><p>revolving round and round, never departing far </p><p>in any direction, and, with majestic strength, riding </p><p>down or brushing aside the floating timbers, wooden </p><p>houses, and other wreckage that pounded against </p><p>her mighty steel sides. </p><p> Just at the time when the waters had mounted</p><p>to the eighteenth story of the beleaguered Municipal </p><p>Building, a sudden change occurred in these cur- </p><p>rents. They swept westward with resistless force, </p><p>and the Uncle Sam was carried directly over the </p><p>drowned city. First she encountered the cables of </p><p>the Manhattan Bridge, striking them near the west- </p><p>ern tower, and, swinging round, wrenched the tower </p><p>itself from its foundations and hurled it beneath </p><p>the waters. </p><p> Then she rushed on, riding with the turbid flood</p><p>high above the buried roofs, finding no other ob- </p><p>struction in her way until she approached the </p><p>Municipal Building, which was stoutly resisting the </p><p>push of the waves. </p><p> Those who were near the windows and on the</p><p>balconies, on the eastern side of the building, saw </p><p>the great battleship coming out of the gray gloom </p><p>like some diluvian monster, and before they could </p><p>comprehend what it was, it crashed, prow on, into</p><p>the steel-ribbed walls, driving them in as if they </p><p>had been the armored sides of an enemy. </p><p> So tremendous was the momentum of the strik-</p><p>ing mass that the huge vessel passed, like a pro- </p><p>jectile, through walls and floors and partitions. </p><p>But as she emerged in the central court the whole </p><p>vast structure came thundering down upon her, and </p><p>ship and building together sank beneath the boil- </p><p>ing waves. </p><p> But out of the awful tangle of steel girders, that</p><p>whipped the air and the water as if some terrible </p><p>spidery life yet clung to them, by one of those </p><p>miracles of chance which defy all the laws of </p><p>probability and reason, a small boat of levium, that </p><p>had belonged to the Uncle Sam, was cast forth, and </p><p>floated away, half submerged but unsinkable; and </p><p>clinging to its thwarts, struggling for breath, in- </p><p>sane with terror, were two men, the sole survivors </p><p>of all those thousands. </p><p> One of them was a seaman who had taken ref-</p><p>uge, with a crowd of comrades, in the boat before </p><p>the battleship rushed down upon the building. All </p><p>of his comrades had been hurled out and lost when </p><p>the blow came, while his present companion was </p><p>swept in and lodged against the thwarts. And so </p><p>those two waifs drove off in the raging waves. Both </p><p>of them were bleeding from many wounds, but </p><p>they had no fatal hurts. </p><p> The boat, though filled with water, was so light</p><p>that it could not sink. Moreover, it was ballasted, </p><p>and amid all its wild gyrations it kept right side </p><p>up. Even the ceaseless downpour from the sky </p><p>could not drive it beneath the waves. </p><p> After a while the currents that had been setting</p><p>westward changed their direction, and the boat </p><p>was driven toward the north. It swept on past </p><p>toppling sky-scrapera until it was over the place </p><p>where Madison Square once spread its lawns, looked </p><p>down upon by gigantic structures, most of which </p><p>had now either crumbled and disappeared or were </p><p>swaying to their fall. Here there was an eddy, and </p><p>the boat turned round and round amid floating </p><p>debris until two other draggled creatures, who had </p><p>been clinging to floating objects, succeeded by des- </p><p>perate efforts in pulling themselves into it. Others </p><p>tried but failed, and no one lent a helping hand. </p><p>Those who were already in the boat neither opposed </p><p>nor aided the efforts of those who battled to enter </p><p>it. No words were heard in the fearful uproar- </p><p>only inarticulate cries. </p><p> Suddenly the current changed again, and the</p><p>boat, with its dazed occupants, was hurried off </p><p>in the direction of the Hudson. Night was now </p><p>beginning once more to drop an obscuring curtain </p><p>over the scene, and under that curtain the last </p><p>throes of drowning New York were hidden. When </p><p>the sun again faintly illuminated the western hem- </p><p>isphere the whole Atlantic seaboard was buried </p><p>under the sea. </p><p> As the water rose higher, Cosmo Versal's Ark</p><p>at last left its cradle, and cumbrously floated off, </p><p>moving first eastward, then turning in the direction </p><p>of Brooklyn and Manhattan. Cosmo had his engines </p><p>in operation, but their full power was not developed </p><p>as soon as he had expected, and the great vessel </p><p>drifted at the will of the currents and the wind, </p><p>the latter coming now from one side and now from </p><p>another, rising at times to hurricane strength and </p><p>then dying away until only a spanking breeze swept </p><p>the ever-falling rain into swishing sheets. Occa- </p><p>sionally the wind failed entirely, and for many </p><p>minutes at a time the water fell in vertical streams. </p><p> At length the motive power of the Ark was de-</p><p>veloped, and it began to obey its helm. From the </p><p>shelter of a “captain’s bridge,” constructed at the </p><p>forward end of the huge levium dome that covered </p><p>the vessel, Cosmo Versal, with Captain Arms, a </p><p>veteran navigator in whose skill he confided, peered </p><p>over the interminable waste of waters. There was </p><p>nothing in sight except floating objects that had </p><p>welled up from the drowned city and the surround- </p><p>850 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>ing villages. Here and there the body of an animal </p><p>or of a human being was seen in the tossing waves, </p><p>and Cosmo Versal sadly shook his head as he point- </p><p>ed them out, but the stout mariner at his side </p><p>chewed his tobacco, and paid attention only to his </p><p>duties, shouting orders from time to time through </p><p>a speaking-tube, or touching an electric button. </p><p> Cosmo Vers&amp;l brought a rain-gauge and again</p><p>and again allowed it to fill itself. The story was </p><p>always the same—two inches per minute, ten feet </p><p>per hour, the water mounted. </p><p> The nebula had settled down to regular work,</p><p>and, if Cosmo’s calculations were sound, there </p><p>would be no intermission for four months. </p><p> After the power of the propellers had been de-</p><p>veloped the Ark was steered south-eastward. Its </p><p>progress was very slow. In the course of eight </p><p>hours it had not gone more than fifty miles. The </p><p>night came on, and the speed was reduced until there </p><p>was only sufficient way to insure the command of </p><p>the vessel’s movements. Powerful search-lights </p><p>were employed as long as the stygian darkness </p><p>continued. </p><p> With the return of the pallid light, at what</p><p>should have been daybreak, Cosmo and his navigator </p><p>were again at their post. In fact, the former had </p><p>not slept at all, keeping watch through the long </p><p>hours, with Captain Arms within easy call. </p><p> As the light became stronger, Cosmo said to the</p><p>captain: </p><p> “Steer toward New York. I wish to see if the</p><p>last of the tall buildings on the upper heights have </p><p>gone under.” </p><p> “It will be very dangerous to go that way,”</p><p>objected Captain Arms. “There are no landmarks, </p><p>and we may strike a snag.” </p><p> “Not if we are careful,” replied Cosmo. “All</p><p>but the highest ground is now buried very deep.” </p><p> “It is taking a fool’s risk,” growled Captain</p><p>Arms, but nevertheless he obeyed. </p><p> It was true that they had nothing to go by. The</p><p>air was too thick with water, and the light too </p><p>feeble for them to be able to lay their course by </p><p>sighting the distant hills of New Jersey which yet </p><p>remained above the level of the flood. Still, by a</p><p>kind of seaman’s instinct, Captain Arms made his </p><p>way, until he felt that he ought to venture no </p><p>farther. He had just turned to Cosmo Versal with </p><p>the intention of voicing his protest, when the Ark </p><p>careened slightly, shivered from stem to stern, and </p><p>then began a bumping movement that nearly threw </p><p>the two men from their feet. </p><p> “We are aground!” cried the captain, and In-</p><p>stantly turned a knob that set in motion automatic </p><p>machinery which cut off the engines from the pro- </p><p>pellers, and at the same time slowed down the </p><p>engines themselves. </p><p>CHAPTER XI </p><p>“A Billion for a Share” </p><p>TtE Ark had lodged on the loftiest part of the </p><p>Palisades. It was only after long and careful </p><p>study of their position, rendered possible by </p><p>occasional glimpses of the Orange Hills and high </p><p>points further up the course of the Hudson, that </p><p>Cosmo Vers&amp;l and Captain Arms were able to </p><p>reach that conclusion. Where New York had stood </p><p>nothing was visible but an expanse of turbid and </p><p>rushing water. </p><p> But suppose the hard trap rocks had penetrated</p><p>the bottom of the Ark! It was a contingency too </p><p>terrible to be thought of. Yet the facts must be </p><p>ascertained at once. </p><p> Cosmo, calling Joseph Smith, and commanding</p><p>him to go among the frightened passengers and as- </p><p>sure them, in his name, that there was no danger, </p><p>hurried, with the captain and a few trusty men, into </p><p>the bowels of the vessel. They thoroughly sounded </p><p>the bottom plates. No aperture and no indentation </p><p>was to be found. </p><p> But, then, the bottom was double, and the outer</p><p>plates might have been perforated. If this had </p><p>happened the fact would reveal itself through the </p><p>leakage of water into the intervening space. To </p><p>ascertain if that had occurred it was necessary to </p><p>unscrew the covers of some of the manholes in the </p><p>inner skin of levium. </p><p> It was an anxious moment when they cautiously</p><p>removed one of these covers. At the last turns of </p><p>the screw the workman who handled it instinctively </p><p>turned his head aside, and made ready for a spring, </p><p>more than half expecting that the cover would be </p><p>driven from his hands, and a stream of water would </p><p>burst in. </p><p> But the cover remained in place after it was</p><p>completely loosened, and until it had been lifted </p><p>off. A sigh of relief broke from every breast. No </p><p>water was visible. </p><p> “Climb in there, and explore the bottom,” Cosmo</p><p>commanded. </p><p> There was a space of eighteen inches between</p><p>the two bottoms, which were connected and braced </p><p>by the curved ribs of the hull. A man immediately </p><p>disappeared in the opening and began the explora- </p><p>tion. Cosmo ordered the removal of other covers </p><p>at various points, and the exploration was extended </p><p>over the whole bottom. He himself passed through </p><p>one of the manholes and aided in the work. </p><p> At last it was determined, beyond any doubt,</p><p>that even the outer skin was uninjured. Not so </p><p>much as a dent could be found in it. </p><p> “By the favor of Providence,” said Cosmo Versal,</p><p>as his head emerged from a manhole, “the Ark </p><p>has touched upon a place where the rocks are cover- </p><p>ed with soil, and no harm has come to us. In a very </p><p>short time the rising water will lift us off.” </p><p> “And, with my consent, you’ll do no more navigat-</p><p>ing over hills and mountains,” grumbled Captain </p><p>Arms. “The open sea for the sailor.” </p><p> The covers were carefully replaced, and the party,</p><p>in happier spirits, returned to the upper decks, </p><p>where the good news was quickly spread. </p><p> The fact was that while the inspection was un-</p><p>der way the Ark had floated off, and when Cosmo </p><p>and the captain reached their bridge the man who </p><p>had been left in charge reported that the vessel </p><p>had swung halfway round. </p><p> “She’s headed for the old Atlantic,” sung out</p><p>Captain Arms. “The sooner we’re off the better.” </p><p> But before the captain could signal the order</p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>851 </p><p>to go ahead, Cosmo Vers£l laid his hand on his </p><p>arm and said: </p><p> “Wait a moment; listen.”</p><p> Through the lashing oi the rain a voice pene-</p><p>trated with a sound between a call and a scream. </p><p>There could be no doubt that it was human. The </p><p>captain and Cosmo looked at one another in speech- </p><p>less astonishment. The idea that any one outside </p><p>the Ark could have survived, and could now be </p><p>afloat amid this turmoil of waters, had not occurred </p><p>to their minds. They experienced a creeping of </p><p>the nerves. In a few minutes the voice came again, </p><p>louder than before, and the words that it pronoun- </p><p>ced being now clearly audible, the two listeners </p><p>could not believe their ears. </p><p> “Cosmo Versal!” it yelled. “Cosm-o-o Ver-sa-al!</p><p>A billion for a share! A billion, I say, a bil-li-on </p><p>for a share I1* </p><p> Then they perceived, a little way off to the left,</p><p>something which looked like the outline of a boat, </p><p>sunk to the gunwales, washed over by every wave, </p><p>and standing in it, up to their knees in water, were </p><p>four men, one of whom was gesticulating violently, </p><p>while the others seemed dazed and incapable of </p><p>voluntary movement. </p><p> It was the boat of levium that had been thrown</p><p>out of the wreckage when the battleship ran down </p><p>the Municipal tower, and we must now follow the </p><p>thread of its adventures up to the time of its en- </p><p>counter with the Ark. </p><p> As the boat was driven westward from the drown-</p><p>ed site of Madison Square it gradually freed itself </p><p>from the objects floating around, most of which </p><p>soon sunk, and in an hour or two its inmates were </p><p>alone—the sole survivors of a population of many </p><p>millions. </p><p> Alone they were in impenetrable darkness, for,</p><p>as we have said, night had by this time once more </p><p>fallen. They floated on, half drowned, chilled to </p><p>the bone, not trying to speak, not really conscious </p><p>of one another’s presence. The rain beat down </p><p>upon them, the waves washed over them, the un- </p><p>sinkable boat sluggishly rose and fell with the heav- </p><p>ing of the water, and occasionally they were nearly </p><p>flung overboard by a sudden lurch—and yet they </p><p>clung with desperate tenacity to the thwarts, as </p><p>if life were still dear, as if they thought that they </p><p>might yet survive, though the world was drowned.</p><p> Thus hours passed, and. at last a glimmer appear-</p><p>ed in the streaming air, and a faint light stole over </p><p>the face of the water. If they saw one another, it </p><p>was with unrecognizing eyes. They were devoured </p><p>with hunger, but they did not know it. </p><p> Suddenly one of them—it was he who had been</p><p>so miraculously thrown into the boat when it shot </p><p>out of the tangle of falling beams and walls—raised </p><p>his head and threw up his arms, a wild light gleam- </p><p>ing in his eyes. </p><p> In a hoarse, screaming voice he yelled:</p><p> “Cosmo Versal!”</p><p> No other syllables that the tongue could shape</p><p>would have produced the effect of that name. It </p><p>roused the three men who heard it from their </p><p>lethargy of despair, and thrilled them to the mar- </p><p>row. With amazed eyes they stared at their com- </p><p>panion. He did not look at them, but gazed off </p><p>into the thick rain. Again his voice rose in a ma- </p><p>niacal shriek: </p><p> “Cosmo Versal! Do you hear me? Let me in!</p><p>A billion for a share!” </p><p> The men looked at each other, and even in their</p><p>desperate situation, felt a stir of pity in their </p><p>hearts. They were not too dazed to comprehend </p><p>that their companion had gone mad. One of them </p><p>moved to his side, and laid a hand upon his shoulder, </p><p>as if he would try to soothe him. </p><p> But the maniac threw him off, nearly precipita-</p><p>ting him over the side of the submerged boat, cry- </p><p>ing: </p><p> “What are you doing in my boat? Over-board</p><p>with you! I am looking for Cosmo Versal! He’s </p><p>got the biggest thing afloat! Securities! Securities! </p><p>Gilt-edged! A billion, I tell you! Here I have </p><p>them—look! Gilt-edged, every one!” and he snatch- </p><p>ed a thick bundle of papers from his pocket and </p><p>waved them wildly until they melted into a pulpy </p><p>mass with the down-pour. </p><p> The others now shrank away from him in fear.</p><p>Fear? Yes, for still they loved their lives, and </p><p>the staggering support beneath their feet had be- </p><p>come as precious to them as the solid earth. They </p><p>would have fought with the fury of madmen to re- </p><p>tain their places in that half-swamped shell. They </p><p>were still capable of experiencing a keener fear </p><p>than that of the flood. They were as terrified by</p><p>the presence of this maniac as they would have been </p><p>on encountering him in their homes. </p><p> But he did not attempt to follow them. He still</p><p>looked off through the driving rain, balancing him- </p><p>self to the sluggish lurching of the boat, and con- </p><p>tinued to rave, and shout, and shake his soaked </p><p>bundle of papers, until, exhausted by his efforts, </p><p>and half-choked by the water that drove in his </p><p>face, he sank helpless upon a thwart. </p><p> Then they fell back into their lethargy, but in</p><p>a little while he was on his feet again, gesticulating </p><p>and raging—and thus hours passed on, and still </p><p>they were afloat, and still clinging to life. </p><p> Suddenly, looming out of the strange gloom,</p><p>they perceived the huge form of the Ark, and all </p><p>struggled to their feet, but none could find voice </p><p>but the maniac. </p><p> As soon as he saw the men, Cosmo Versal had</p><p>run down to the lowest deck, and ordered the open- </p><p>ing of a gangway on that side. When the door </p><p>swung back he found himself within a few yards </p><p>of the swamped boat, but ten feet above its level. </p><p>Joseph Smith, Professor Moses, Professor Jones, </p><p>Professor Able, and others of the passengers, and </p><p>several of the crew, hurried to his side, while the </p><p>rest of the passengers crowded as near as they </p><p>could get. </p><p> The instant that Cosmo appeared the maniac re-</p><p>doubled his cries. </p><p> “Here they are,” he yelled, shaking what remain-</p><p>ed of his papers. “A billion—all gilt-edged! Let </p><p>me in. But shut out the others. They’re only little </p><p>fellows. They’ve got no means. They can’t float </p><p>an enterprise like this. Ah, you're a bright one! </p><p>You and me, Cosmo Vers&amp;l—we’ll squeeze ’em all </p><p>out. I’ll give you the secrets. We’ll own the earth! </p><p>I’m Amos Blank!" </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>852 </p><p> Cosmo Vers£l recognized the man in spite of the</p><p>dreadful change that had come over him. His </p><p>face was white and drawn, his eyes staring, his </p><p>head bare, his hair matted with water, his cloth- </p><p>ing in shreds—but it was unmistakably Amos </p><p>Blank, a man whoBe features the newspapers had </p><p>rendered familiar to millions, a man who had for </p><p>years stood before the public as the unabashed </p><p>representative of the system of remorseless repres- </p><p>sion of competition, and shameless corruption of </p><p>justice and legislation.- After the world, for nearly </p><p>three generations, had enjoyed the blessings of the </p><p>reforms in business methods and social ideals that </p><p>had been inaugurated by the great uprising of the </p><p>people in the first quarter of the twentieth century, </p><p>Amos Blank, and lesser men of his ilk, had swung </p><p>back the, pendulum, and reestablished more firmly </p><p>than ever the reign of monopoly and iniquitous </p><p>privilege. </p><p> The water-logged little craft floated nearer until</p><p>it almost touched the side of the Ark directly below </p><p>the gangway. The madman’s eyes glowed with </p><p>eagerness, and he reached up his papers, continually </p><p>yelling his refrain: “A billion! Gilt-edged! Let </p><p>me in! Don’t give the rabble a show!” </p><p> Cosmo made no reply, but gazed down upon the</p><p>man and his bedraggled companions with impassive </p><p>features, but thoughtful eyes. Any one who knew </p><p>him intimately, as Joseph Smith alone did, could </p><p>have read his mind. He was asking himself what </p><p>he ought to do. Here was the whole fundamental </p><p>question to be gone over again. To what purpose </p><p>had he taken so great pains to select the flower </p><p>of mankind? Here was the head and chief of the </p><p>offense that he had striven to eliminate appealing </p><p>to him to be saved under circumstances which went </p><p>straight to the heart and awoke every sentiment </p><p>of humanity. </p><p> Presently he said in as low a voice as could be</p><p>made audible: </p><p> “Joseph, advise me. What should I do?”</p><p> “You were willing to take Professor Pludder,”</p><p>replied Smith evasively, but with a plain leaning to </p><p>the side of mercy. </p><p> “You know very well that that was different,”</p><p>Cosmo returned irritably. “Pludder was not morally </p><p>rotten. He was only mistaken. He had the funda- </p><p>mental scientific quality, and I'm sorry he threw </p><p>himself away in his obstinacy. But this man—”</p><p>“Since he is alone,” broke in Joseph Smith with </p><p>a sudden illumination, “he could do no harm.” </p><p>Cosmo Versal’s expression instantly brightened. </p><p>“You are right!” he exclaimed. “By himself he </p><p>can do nothing. I am sure there is no one aboard </p><p>who would sympathize with his ideas. Alone, he </p><p>is innocuous. Besides, he’s insane, and I can’t leave </p><p>him to drown in that condition. And I must take the </p><p>others, too. Let down a landing stage,” he con- </p><p>tinued in a louder voice, addressing some members </p><p>of the crew. </p><p> In a few minutes all four of the unfortunates,</p><p>seeming more dead than alive, were helped into the </p><p>Ark. </p><p> Amos Blank immediately precipitated himself</p><p>upon Cosmo Versal, and, seizing him by the arm, </p><p>tried to lead him apart, saying in his ear, as he </p><p>glared round upon the faces of the throng which </p><p>crowded every available space: </p><p> “Hist! Overboard with ’em! What’s all this'</p><p>trash? Shovel ’em out! They’ll want to get in </p><p>with us; they’ll queer the game!” </p><p> Then he turned furiously upon the persons near-</p><p>est him, and began to push them toward the open </p><p>gangway. At a signal from Cosmo Versal, two </p><p>men seized him and pinioned his arms. At that his </p><p>mood changed, and, wrenching himself loose, he </p><p>onoe more ran to Cosmo, waving his bedraggled </p><p>bundle, and shouting: </p><p> “A billion! Here’s the certificates—gilt-edge!</p><p>But,” he continued, with a cunning leer, and sud- </p><p>denly thrusting the sodden papers into his pocket, </p><p>“you’ll make out the receipts first. I’ll put in five </p><p>billions to make it a sure go, if you won’t let in an- </p><p>other soul” </p><p> Cosmo shook off the man’s grasp, and again call-</p><p>ing the two members of the crew who had before </p><p>pinioned his arms, told them to lead him away, at </p><p>the same time saying to him: </p><p> “You go with these men into my room. I’ll see</p><p>you later.” </p><p> Blank took it in the best part, and willingly ac-</p><p>companied his conductors, only stopping a moment </p><p>to wink over his shoulder at Cosmo, and then he </p><p>was led through the crowd, which regarded him </p><p>with unconcealed astonishment, and in many cases </p><p>with no small degree of fear. As soon as he was </p><p>beyond earshot, Cosmo directed Joseph Smith to </p><p>hurry ahead of the party and conduct them to a</p><p>particular apartment, which he designated at the </p><p>same time, saying to Smith: </p><p> “Turn the key on him as soon as he’s inside.”</p><p>Amos Blank, now an insane prisoner in Cosmo </p><p>Versdl’s Ark, had been the greatest financial power </p><p>in the world’s metropolis, a man of iron nerve and </p><p>the clearest of brains, who always kept his head and </p><p>never uttered a foolish word. It was he who had </p><p>stood over the flight of steps in the Municipal Build- </p><p>ing, coolly measuring with his eye the rise of the </p><p>water, exposing the terrible error that sent such </p><p>a wave of unreasoning joy through the hearts of the </p><p>thousands of refugees crowded into the doomed </p><p>edifice, and receiving blows and curses for making </p><p>the truth known. </p><p> He had himself taken refuge there, after visiting</p><p>his office and filling his pockets with his most preci- </p><p>ous papers. How, by a marvelous stroke of fate, he </p><p>became one of the four persons who alone escaped </p><p>from New York after the downpour began is al- </p><p>ready known.	t</p><p>The other men taken from the boat were treated </p><p>like rescued mariners snatched from a wreck at </p><p>sea. Every attention was lavished upon them, and </p><p>Cosmo Versal did not appear to regret, as far as </p><p>they were concerned, that his ship’s company had </p><p>been so unexpectedly recruited. </p><p>CHAPTER XII </p><p>Submergence of the Old World </p><p>WE now turn our attention for a time from </p><p>the New World to the Old. What did the </p><p>thronging populations of Europe, Africa, </p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>' 853 </p><p>and Asia do when the signs of coming disaster </p><p>chased one another, when the swollen oceans be- </p><p>gan to burst their bonds, and when the windows of </p><p>the firmament were opened? </p><p> The picture that can be drawn must necessarily</p><p>be very fragmentary, because the number who es- </p><p>caped was small and the records that they left are </p><p>few. </p><p> The savants of the older nations were, in gen-</p><p>eral, quite as incredulous and as set in their opposi- </p><p>tion to Cosmo Versil’s extraordinary outgivings as </p><p>those of America. They decried his science and de- </p><p>nounced his predictions as the work of a fool or a </p><p>madman. The president of the Royal Astronomical </p><p>Society of Great Britain proved to the satisfaction </p><p>of most of his colleagues that a nebula could not </p><p>possibly contain enough water to drown an asteroid, </p><p>let alone the earth. </p><p> “The nebulae,” said this learned astronomer, amid</p><p>the plaudits of his hearers, “are infinitely rarer in </p><p>composition than the rarest gas left in the receiver </p><p>of an exhausted air-pump. I would undertake to </p><p>swallow from a wine-glass the entire substance of </p><p>any nebula that could enter the space between the </p><p>earth and the sun, if it were condensed into the' </p><p>liquid state.” </p><p> ‘It might be intoxicating,” called out a face-</p><p>tious member. </p><p> “Will the chair permit me to point out,” said an-</p><p>other with great gravity, “that such a proceeding </p><p>would be eminently rash, for the nebulous fluid </p><p>might be highly poisonous.” [“Hear! Hear I” and </p><p>laaghter.l </p><p> “What do you say of this strange darkness and</p><p>these storms?” asked an earnest-looking man. </p><p>(This meeting was held after the terrors of the </p><p>“Third Sign” had occurred.) </p><p> “I say,” replied the president, “that that is the</p><p>affair of the Meteorological Society, and has noth- </p><p>ing to do with astronomy. I dare say that they can </p><p>account for it.” </p><p> “And I dare say they can’t,” cried a voice.</p><p> “HearI Hear!” “Who are you?” “Put him outl"</p><p>“I dare say he’s right!” “Cosmo Vers&amp;l!” Every- </p><p>body was talking at once. </p><p>"Will this gentleman identify himself?” asked </p><p>the president. “Will he please explain his words?” </p><p>“That I will,” said a tall man with long whisk- </p><p>ers, rising at the rear end of the room. “I am </p><p>pretty well known. I—” </p><p> “It’s Jameson, the astrologer,” cried a voice.</p><p>“What’s he doing here?” </p><p> “Yes,” said the whiskered man,” “it’s Jameson,</p><p>the astrologer, and he has come here to let you </p><p>know that Cosmo Vers&amp;l was born under the sign </p><p>Cancer, the first of the watery triplicity, and that </p><p>Berosus, the Chaldean, declared—” </p><p> An uproar immediately ensued; half the mem-</p><p>bers were on their feet at once; there was a scuffle </p><p>in the back part of the room, and Jameson, the as- </p><p>trologer, was hustled out, shouting at the top of </p><p>his voice: </p><p> “Berosus, the Chaldean, predicted that the world</p><p>would be drowned when all the planets should as- </p><p>semble in the sign Cancer—and where are they </p><p>now? Blind and stupid dolts that you are—where </p><p>are they now?” </p><p> It was some time before order could be restored,</p><p>and a number of members disappeared, having fol- </p><p>lowed Jameson, the astrologer, possibly through </p><p>sympathy, or possibly with a desire to learn more </p><p>about the prediction of Berosus, the father of as- </p><p>trology. </p><p> When those who remained, and who constituted</p><p>the great majority of the membership, had quieted </p><p>down, the president remarked that the interruption </p><p>which they had just experienced was quite in line </p><p>with all the other proceedings of the disturbers of </p><p>public tranquillity who, under the lead of a crazy </p><p>American charlatan, were trying to deceive the ig- </p><p>norant multitude. But they would find themselves </p><p>seriously in error if they imagined that their ab- </p><p>surd ideas were going to be “taken over” in Eng- </p><p>land.	'</p><p> “I dare say,” he concluded, “that there is some</p><p>scheme behind it all.” </p><p> “Another American *trust’!” cried a voice.</p><p> The proceedings were finally brought to an end,</p><p>but not before a modest member had risen in hia </p><p>place and timidly remarked that there was one </p><p>question that he would like to put to the chair— </p><p>one thing that did not seem to have been made </p><p>quite clear—“Where were the planets now?”</p><p> A volley of hoots, mingled with a few “hears!”</p><p>constituted the only reply. </p><p> Scenes not altogether unlike this occurred in the</p><p>other great learned societies—astronomical, meteor- </p><p>ological, and geological. The official representatives </p><p>of science were virtually unanimous in condemna- </p><p>tion of Cosmo Versal, and in persistent assertion </p><p>that nothing that had occurred was inexplicable by </p><p>known laws. But in no instance did they make it </p><p>clear to anybody precisely what were the laws that </p><p>they invoked, or how it happened that Cosmo Ver- </p><p>s&amp;I had been able to predict so many strange things </p><p>which everybody knew really had come to pass, </p><p>such as the sudden storms and the great darkness. </p><p> We are still, it must not be forgotten, dealing</p><p>with a time anterior to the rising of the sea. </p><p> The Paris Academy of Sciences voted that the</p><p>subject was unworthy of serious investigation, and </p><p>similar action was taken in Berlin, Leningrad, Vi- </p><p>enna, and elsewhere. </p><p> But among the people at large universal alarm</p><p>prevailed, and nothing was so eagerly read as the </p><p>despatches from New York, detailing the proceed- </p><p>ings of Cosmo Versil, and describing the progress </p><p>of his great levium ark. In England many procured </p><p>copies of Cosmo’s circulars, in which the proper </p><p>methods to be pursued in the construction of arks </p><p>were carefully set forth. Some set to work to build </p><p>such vessels; but, following British methods of </p><p>construction, they doubled the weight of everything, </p><p>with the result that, if Cosmo had seen what they </p><p>were about he would have told them that such arks </p><p>would go to the bottom faster than to the top. </p><p> In Germany the balloon idea took full possession</p><p>of the public mind. Germany had long before de- </p><p>veloped the greatest fleet of dirigibles in existence, </p><p>preferring them to every other type of flying ap- </p><p>paratus. It was reported that if worst came to </p><p>854 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>worst the best manner of meeting the emergency </p><p>would be by the multiplication of dirigibles and the </p><p>increase of their capacity. </p><p> The result was that a considerable number of</p><p>wealthy Germans began the construction of such </p><p>vessels. But when interviewed they denied that </p><p>they were preparing for a flood. They said that </p><p>they simply wished to enlarge and increase the num- </p><p>ber of their pleasure craft. All this was in con- </p><p>temptuous defiance of the warning which Cosmo </p><p>Vers&amp;l had been careful to insert in his circulars, </p><p>that “balloons and aeros of all kinds will be of no </p><p>use whatever; the only safety will be found in arks, </p><p>and they must be provisioned for at least five </p><p>years.” </p><p> The most remarkable thing of all happened in</p><p>France. It might naturally have been expected that </p><p>a Frenchman who thought it worth his while to </p><p>take any precautions against the extinction of the </p><p>human race, would, when it became a question of a </p><p>flood, have turned to the aero, for from the com- </p><p>mencement of aerial navigation French engineers </p><p>had maintained an unquestionable superiority in </p><p>the construction and perfection of that kind of ma- </p><p>chine. </p><p> Their aeros could usually fly longer and carry</p><p>more dead weight than those of any other nation. </p><p>In the transoceanic aero races which occasionally </p><p>took place the French furnished the most daring </p><p>and the most frequently successful competitors. </p><p> Then, too, the French mind is masterly in ap-</p><p>preciation of details, and Cosmo Versal’s reasons </p><p>for condemning the aero and the balloon as means </p><p>of escaping the flood were promptly divined. In the </p><p>first place it was seen that no kind of airship could </p><p>be successfully provisioned for a flight of indefinite </p><p>length, and in the second place the probable strength </p><p>of the winds, or the crushing weight of the de- </p><p>scending water, in case, as Cosmo predicted, a </p><p>nebula should condense upon the earth, would </p><p>either sweep an aero or a balloon to swift destruc- </p><p>tion, or carry it down into the waves like a water- </p><p>soaked butterfly. </p><p> Accordingly, when a few Frenchmen began seri-</p><p>ously to consider the question of providing a way </p><p>of escape from the flood—always supposing, for </p><p>the sake of argument, that there would be a flood </p><p>—they got together, under the leadership of an en- </p><p>gineer officer named Yves de Beauxchamps, and dis- </p><p>cussed the matter in all its aspects. They were not</p><p>long in arriving at the conclusion that the best </p><p>thing that could possibly be done woyld be to con- </p><p>struct a submarine. </p><p> In fact, this was almost an inevitable conclusion</p><p>for them, because before the abandonment of sub- </p><p>marines in war on account of their too great pow- </p><p>ers of destruction—a circumstance which had also </p><p>led to the prohibition of the use of explosive bombs </p><p>in the aerial navies—the French had held the lead </p><p>in the construction and management of submers- </p><p>ible vessels, even more decisively than in the case of </p><p>aeros.	»</p><p> “A large submarine,” said de Beauxchamps, “in-</p><p>to whose construction a certain amount of levium </p><p>entered, would possess manifest advantages over </p><p>Versal’s Ark. It could be provisioned to any extent </p><p>desired, it would escape the discomforts of the </p><p>waves, winds, and flooding rain, and it could easily </p><p>rise to the surface whenever that might be desir- </p><p>able for change of air. It would have all the am- </p><p>phibious advantages of a whale.” </p><p> The others were decidedly of de Beauxchamps’s</p><p>opinion, and it was enthusiastically resolved that a </p><p>vessel of this kind should be begun at once. </p><p> “If we don’t need it for a flood,” said de Beaux-</p><p>champs, “we can employ it for a pleasure vessel to </p><p>visit the wonders of the deep. We will then make </p><p>a reality of that marvelous dream of our country- </p><p>man of old, that prince of dreamers, Jules Verne.” </p><p> “Let’s name it for him!” cried one.</p><p> "Admirable! Charming!” they all exclaimed</p><p>“Vive le ‘Jules Verne’!” </p><p> Within two days, but without the knowledge of</p><p>the public, the keel of the submersible “Jules Verne” </p><p>was laid. But we shall hear of that remarkable </p><p>craft again. </p><p> While animated, and in some cases violent, dis-</p><p>cussions were taking place in the learned circles of </p><p>Europe, and a few were making ready in such man- </p><p>ner as they deemed most effective for possible con- </p><p>tingencies, waves of panic swept over the remain- </p><p>der of the Old World. There were yet hundreds of </p><p>millions in Africa and Asia to whom the advantages </p><p>of scientific instruction had not extended, but who, </p><p>while still more or less under the dominion of ig- </p><p>norance and superstition, were in touch with the </p><p>news of the whole planet. </p><p> The rumor that a wise man in America had dis-</p><p>covered that the world was to be drowned was not </p><p>long in reaching the most remote recess of the </p><p>African forests and of the boundless steppes of the </p><p>greater continent, and, however it might be rid- </p><p>iculed or received with skeptical smiles in the </p><p>strongholds of civilization, it met with ready be- </p><p>lief in less enlightened minds. </p><p> Then, the three “signs”—the first great heat,</p><p>the onslaught of storm and lightning, and the </p><p>Noche Triste, the great darkness—had been world- </p><p>wide in their effects, and each had heightened the </p><p>terror caused by its predecessor. Moreover, in the </p><p>less enlightened parts of the world the reassurances </p><p>of the astronomers and others did not penetrate at </p><p>all, or, if they did, had no effect, for not only does </p><p>bad news run while good news walks, but it talks </p><p>faster. </p><p> It will be recalled that one of the most disquiet-</p><p>ing incidents in America, immediately preceding </p><p>the catastrophic rising of the oceans, was the melt- </p><p>ing of the Arctic snows and ice-fields, with conse- </p><p>quent inundations in the north. This stage in the </p><p>progress of the coming disaster was accentuated in </p><p>Europe by the existence of the vast glaciers of the </p><p>Alps. The Rocky Mountains, in their middle </p><p>course, had relatively little snow and almost no </p><p>true glaciers, and consequently there were no scenes </p><p>of this kind in the United States comparable with </p><p>those that occurred in the heart of Europe. </p><p> After the alarm caused by the great darkness in</p><p>September had died out, and the long spell of con- </p><p>tinuous clear skies began, the summer resorts of </p><p>Switzerland were crowded as they had seldom been. </p><p>People were driven there by the heat, for one thing; </p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>855 </p><p>and then, owing to the early melting of the win- </p><p>ter’s deposit of snow, the Alps presented them- </p><p>selves in a new aspect. </p><p> Mountain-climbers found it easy to make ascents</p><p>upon peaks which had always hitherto presented </p><p>great difficulties on account of the vast snow-fields, </p><p>seamed with dangerous crevasses, which hung upon </p><p>their flanks. These were now. so far removed that </p><p>it was practicable for amateur climbers to go where </p><p>always before only trained alpinists, accompanied </p><p>by the most experienced guides, dared to venture. </p><p> But as the autumn days ran on and on new snows</p><p>fell, the deep-seated glaciers began to dissolve, and </p><p>masses of ice that had lain for untold centuries in </p><p>the mighty laps of the mountains, projecting their </p><p>frozen noses into the valleys, came tumbling down, </p><p>partly in the form of torrents of water and partly </p><p>in roaring avalanches. </p><p> The great Aletsch glacier was turned into a river</p><p>that swept down into the valley of the Rh6ne, carry- </p><p>ing everything before it. The glaciers at the head </p><p>of the Rhone added their contribution. The whole </p><p>of the Bernese Oberland seemed to have suddenly </p><p>been dissolved like a huge mass of sugar candy, </p><p>and on the north the valley of Interlaken was inun- </p><p>dated, while the lakes of Thun and Brientz were </p><p>lost in an inland sea which rapidly spread over all </p><p>the lower lands between the Alps and the Swiss </p><p>Jura. </p><p> Farther north the Rhine, swollen by the continual</p><p>descent of the glacier water, burst its banks, and </p><p>broadened out until Strasbourgh lay under water </p><p>with the finger of its ancient cathedral helplessly </p><p>pointing skyward out of the midst of the flood. </p><p>All the ancient cities of the great valley from </p><p>Basle to Mayence saw their streets inundated and </p><p>the foundations of their most precious architectural </p><p>monuments undermined by the searching water. </p><p> The swollen river reared back at the narrow pass</p><p>through the Taunus range, and formed a huge eddy </p><p>that swirled over the old city of Bingen. Then </p><p>it tore down between the castle-crowned heights, </p><p>sweeping away the villages on the river banks from </p><p>Bingen to Coblentz, lashing the projecting rocks </p><p>of the Lorelei, and carrying off houses, churches </p><p>and old abbeys in a rush of ruin. </p><p> It widened out as it approached Bonn and</p><p>Cologne, but the water was still deep enough to </p><p>inundate those cities, and finally it spread over the</p><p>plain of Holland, finding a score of new mouths </p><p>through which to pour into the German ocean, </p><p>while the reclaimed area of the Zuyder Zee once </p><p>more joined the ocean, and Amsterdam and the </p><p>other cities of the Netherlands were flooded, in </p><p>many cases to the tops of the house doors. </p><p> West and south the situation was the same. The</p><p>Mer de Glace at Chamonix, and all the other </p><p>glaciers of the Mont Blanc range, disappeared, </p><p>sending floods down to Geneva and over the Dau- </p><p>phiny and down into the plains of Piedmont and </p><p>Lombardy. The ruin was tremendous and the loss </p><p>of life incalculable. Geneva, Turin, Milan, and </p><p>a hundred other cities, were swept by torrents. </p><p> The rapidity of this melting of the vast snow-</p><p>beds and glaciers of the Alps was inconceivable, </p><p>and the effect of the sudden denudation upon the </p><p>mountains themselves was ghastly. Their seamed </p><p>cavernous sides stood forth, gaunt and naked, a </p><p>revelation of nature in her most fearful aspects </p><p>such as men had never looked upon. Mont Blanc, </p><p>without its blanket of snow and ice, towered like </p><p>the blackened ruin of a fallen world, a sight that </p><p>made the beholders shudder. </p><p> But this flood ended as suddenly as it had begun.</p><p>When the age-long accumulations of snow had all </p><p>melted, the torrents ceased to pour down from the </p><p>mountains, and immediately the courageous and in- </p><p>dustrious inhabitants of the Netherlands began </p><p>to repair their broken dikes, while in Northern </p><p>Italy and the plains of Southeastern France every </p><p>effort was made to restore the terrible losses. </p><p> Of course similar scenes had been enacted, and</p><p>on even a more fearful scale, in the plains of India, </p><p>flooded by the melting of the enormous icy burden </p><p>that covered the Himalayas, the "Abode of Snow.” </p><p>And all over the world, wherever icy mountains </p><p>reared themselves above inhabited lands, the same </p><p>story of destruction and death was told. </p><p> Then, after an interval, came the yet more aw-</p><p>ful invasion of the sea. </p><p> But few details can be given from lack of records.</p><p>The Thames roared backward on its course, and </p><p>London and all central England were inundated. </p><p>A great bore of sea-water swept along the shores </p><p>of the English Channel, and bursting through the </p><p>Skager-Rak, covered the lower end of Sweden, </p><p>and rushed up the Gulf of Finland, buiying Lenin- </p><p>grad, and turning all Western Russia, and the plains </p><p>of Pomerania into a sea. The Netherlands disap- </p><p>peared. The Atlantic poured through the narrow</p><p>pass of the Strait of Gibraltar, leaving only the </p><p>Lion Rock visible above the waves. </p><p> At length the ocean found its way into the Desert</p><p>of Sahara, large areas of which had been reclaimed, </p><p>and were inhabited by a considerable population of </p><p>prosperous farmers. Nowhere did the sudden com- </p><p>ing of the flood cause greater consternation than </p><p>here—strange as that statement may seem. The </p><p>people had an undefined idea that they were pro- </p><p>tected by a sort of barrier from any possible inunda- </p><p>tion. </p><p> It had taken so many years and such endless</p><p>labor to introduce into the Sahara sufficient water </p><p>to transform its potentially rich soil into arable </p><p>land that the thought of any sudden superabundance </p><p>of that element was far from the minds of the in- </p><p>dustrious agriculturists. They had heard of the </p><p>inundations caused by the melting of the mountain </p><p>snows elsewhere, but there were no snow-clad </p><p>mountains near them to be feared. </p><p> Accordingly, when a great wave of water came</p><p>rushing upon them, surmounted, where it swept </p><p>over yet unredeemed areas of the desert, by im- </p><p>mense clouds of whirling dust, that darkened the </p><p>air and recalled the old days of the simoom, they </p><p>were taken completely by surprise. But as the </p><p>water rose higher they tried valiantly to escape. </p><p>They were progressive people, and many of them </p><p>had aeros. Besides, two or three lines of aero </p><p>expresses crossed their country. All who could </p><p>do so immediately embarked in airships, some flee- </p><p>ing toward Europe, and others hovering about, </p><p>856 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>gazing in despair at the spreading waters beneath </p><p>them. </p><p> As the invasion of the sea grew more and more</p><p>serious, this flight by airship became a common </p><p>spectacle over all the lower-lying parts of Europe, </p><p>and in the British Isles. But, in the midst of it, </p><p>the heavens opened their flood-gates, as they had </p><p>done in the New World, and then the aeros, </p><p>flooded with rain, and hurled about by contending </p><p>blasts of wind, drooped, fluttered, and fell by </p><p>hundreds into the fast mounting waves. The nebula </p><p>was upon them! </p><p> In the mean time those who had provided arks</p><p>of one kind or another, tried desperately to get </p><p>them safely afloat. All the vessels that succeeded </p><p>in leaving their wharves were packed with fugitives. </p><p>Boats of every sort were pressed into use, and the </p><p>few that survived were soon floating over the </p><p>sites of the drowned homes of their occupants. </p><p> Before it was too late Yves de Beauxchamps and</p><p>his friends launched their submarine, and plunged </p><p>into the bosom of the flood. </p><p>CHAPTER XIII </p><p>Strange Freaks of the Nebula </p><p>E return to follow the fortunes of Cosmo </p><p>Versal’s Ark. </p><p> After he had so providentially picked up</p><p>the crazed billionaire, Amos Blank, and his three </p><p>companions, Cosmo ordered Capt. Arms to bear </p><p>away southeastward, bidding farewell to the drown- </p><p>ed shores of America, and sailing directly over the </p><p>lower part of Manhattan, and western Long Island. </p><p>The navigation was not easy, and if the ark had </p><p>not been a marvelously buoyant vessel It would not </p><p>long have survived. At the beginning the heavy </p><p>and continuous rain kept down the waves, and the </p><p>surface of the sea was comparatively smooth, but </p><p>after a while a curious phenomenon began to be </p><p>noticed; immense billows would suddenly appear, </p><p>rushing upon the ark now from one direction and </p><p>now from another, canting it over at a dangerous </p><p>angle, and washing almost to the top of the huge </p><p>ellipsoid of the dome. At such times it was difficult </p><p>for anybody to maintain a footing, and there was </p><p>great terror among the passengers. But Cosmo, </p><p>and stout Capt. Arms, remained at their post, </p><p>relieving one another at frequent intervals, and </p><p>never entrusting the sole charge of the vessel to</p><p>any of their lieutenants. </p><p> Cosmo Versal himself was puzzled to account for</p><p>the origin of the mighty billows, for it seemed im- </p><p>possible that they could be raised by the wind not- </p><p>withstanding the fact that it blew at times with </p><p>hurricane force. But at last the explanation came </p><p>of itself. </p><p> Both Cosmo and the captain happened to be on</p><p>the bridge together when they saw ahead something </p><p>that looked like an enormous column as black as ink, </p><p>standing upright on the surface of the water. A </p><p>glance showed that it was in swift motion, and, </p><p>more than that, was approaching in a direct line </p><p>toward the Ark. In less than two minutes It was </p><p>upon them. </p><p> The instant that it met the Ark a terrific roaring</p><p>deafened them, and the rounded front of the dome </p><p>beneath their eyes disappeared under a deluge .of </p><p>descending water so dense that the vision oould </p><p>not penetrate it. In another half minute the great </p><p>vessel seemed to have been driven to the bottom </p><p>of the sea. But for the peculiar construction of </p><p>the shelter of the bridge its occupants would have </p><p>been drowned at their posts. As it was they were </p><p>soaked as if they had been plunged overboard. Im- </p><p>penetrable darkness surrounded them. </p><p> But the buoyant vessel shook itself, rolled from</p><p>side to side, and rose with a staggering motion un- </p><p>til it seemed to be poised on the summit of a watery </p><p>mountain* Immediately the complete darkness pass- </p><p>ed, the awful downpour ceased, although the rain </p><p>still fell in torrents, and the Ark began to glide </p><p>downward with sickening velocity, as if it were </p><p>sliding down a liquid slope. </p><p> It was a considerable time before the two men,</p><p>clinging to the supports of the bridge, were able </p><p>to maintain their equilibrium sufficiently to render </p><p>it possible to utter a few connected words. As soon </p><p>as he could speak with reasonable comfort Cosmo </p><p>exclaimed: </p><p> "Now I see what it is that causes the billows,</p><p>but it is a phenomenon that I should never have </p><p>anticipated. It is all due to the nebula. Evidently </p><p>there are irregularities of some kind in its consti- </p><p>tution which cause the formation of almost solid </p><p>masses of water in the atmosphere—suspended </p><p>lakes, as it were—which then plunge down in a </p><p>body as if a hundred thousand Niagaras were pour- </p><p>ing together from the sky. </p><p> “These sudden accessions of water raise stupend-</p><p>ous waves which sweep off in every direction, and </p><p>that explains the billows that we have encountered." </p><p> “Well, this nebular navigation beats all my experi-</p><p>ence,” said Capt. Arms, wiping the water out of </p><p>his eyes. “I was struck by a waterspout once in the </p><p>Indian ocean, and I thought that that capped the </p><p>climax, but it was only a catspaw to this. Give me </p><p>a clear offing and I don’t care how much wind </p><p>blows, but blow me if I want to get under any more </p><p>lakes in the sky.” </p><p> “We'll have to take whatever comes,” returned</p><p>Cosmo, “but I don’t think there is much danger of </p><p>running directly into many of these downpours as </p><p>we did into this one. Now that we know what </p><p>they are, we can, perhaps, detect them long enough </p><p>in advance to steer out of their way. Anyhow, </p><p>we’ve got a good vessel under our feet. Anything </p><p>but an ark of Ievium would have gone under for </p><p>good, and if I had not covered the vessel with the </p><p>dome there would have been no chance for a soul in </p><p>her.” </p><p> As a matter of fact, the Ark did not encounter</p><p>any more of the columns of descending water, but </p><p>the frequent billows that were met showed that </p><p>they were careering over the face of the sea in </p><p>every direction- </p><p> But there was another trouble of a different</p><p>nature. The absence of sun and stars deprived </p><p>them of the ordinary means of discovering their </p><p>place. They could only make a rough guees as to </p><p>the direction in which they were going. The com- </p><p>passes gave them considerable assistance, and they </p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>857 </p><p>had perfect chronometers, but these latter could be </p><p>of no use without celestial observations of some </p><p>kind. </p><p> At length Cosmo devised a means of obtaining</p><p>observations that were of sufficient value to partial- </p><p>ly serve their purpose. He found that while the </p><p>disk of the sun was completely hidden in the watery </p><p>sky, yet it was possible to determine its location by </p><p>means of the varying intensity of the light. </p><p> Where the sun was, a concentrated glow appeared,</p><p>shading gradually off on all sides. With infinite </p><p>pains Cosmo, assisted by the experience of the cap- </p><p>tain, succeeded in determining the center of maxi- </p><p>mum illumination, and, assuming that to represent </p><p>the true place of the sun, they got something in </p><p>the nature of observations for altitude and azimuth, </p><p>and Capt. Arms even drew on his chart "Sumner </p><p>lines’* to determine the position of the Ark, al- </p><p>though he smiled at the thought of their absurd </p><p>inaccuracy. Still, it was the best they could do, </p><p>and was better than nothing at all. </p><p> They kept a log going also, although, as the cap-</p><p>tain pointed out, it was not of much use to know </p><p>how fast they were traveling, since they could not </p><p>know the precise direction, within a whole point of </p><p>the compass, or perhaps several points. </p><p> “Besides,” he remarked, “what do we know of</p><p>the currents? This is not the old Atlantic. If I </p><p>could feel the Gulf Stream I'd know whereabouts </p><p>I was, but these currents come from all directions, </p><p>and a man might as well try to navigate in a tub </p><p>of boiling water.” </p><p> “But we can, at least, keep working eastward,”</p><p>said Cosmo. “My idea is first to make enough south- </p><p>ing to get into the latitude of the Sahara Desert, </p><p>and then run directly east, so as to cross Africa </p><p>where there are no mountains, and where we shall </p><p>be certain of having plenty of water under our </p><p>keeL </p><p> “Then, having got somewhere in the neighborhood</p><p>of Suez, we can steer down into the region of the </p><p>Indian ocean, and circle round south of the Hima- </p><p>layas. I want to keep an eye on those mountains, </p><p>and stay around the place where they disappear, </p><p>because that will be the first part of the earth to </p><p>emerge from the flood and it is there that we shall </p><p>ultimately make land.” </p><p> “Well, we’re averaging eight knots,” said the cap-</p><p>tain, “ and at that rate we ought to be In the longi- </p><p>tude of the African coast in about twenty days. </p><p>How high will the water stand then?” </p><p> "My gages show,” replied Cosmo, “that the regu-</p><p>lar fall amounts to exactly the same thing a9 at </p><p>the beginning—two inches a minute. Of course </p><p>the spouts increase the amount locally, but </p><p>I don’t think that they add materially to the general </p><p>rise of the flood. Two inches per minute means </p><p>4,800 feet in twenty days. That’ll be sufficient to </p><p>make safe navigation for us all the way across </p><p>northern Africa. We’ll have to be careful in get- </p><p>ting out into the Indian Ocean area, for there are </p><p>mountains on both sides that might give us trouble, </p><p>but the higher ones will still be in sight, and they </p><p>will serve to indicate the location of the lower </p><p>ranges already submerged, but not covered deeply </p><p>enough to afford safe going over them.” </p><p> “All right,” said Captain Arms, “you’re the com-</p><p>modore, but if we don’t hang our timbers on the </p><p>Mountain of the Moon, or the Alps, or old Ararat, </p><p>I’m a porpoise. Why can’t you keep circling round </p><p>at a safe distance, in the middle of the Atlantic, </p><p>until all these reefs get a good depth of water on </p><p>’em?” </p><p> “Because,” Cosmo replied, “even if we keep right</p><p>on now it will probably take two months, allowing </p><p>for delays in getting around dangerous places, to </p><p>come within sight of the Himalayas, and in two </p><p>months the flood will have risen nearly 15,000 feet, </p><p>thus hiding many of the landmarks. If we should </p><p>hold off here a couple of months before starting </p><p>eastward nothing but the one highest peak on the </p><p>globe would be left in sight by the time we arrived </p><p>there, and that wouldn’t be anything more than a </p><p>rock, so that with the uncertainty of our naviga- </p><p>tion we might not be able to find it at all. I must </p><p>know the spot where Tibet sinks, and then manage </p><p>to keep in its neighborhood.” </p><p> That ended the argument</p><p> “Give me a safe port, with lights and bearings,</p><p>and I’ll undertake to hit it anywhere in the two </p><p>hemispheres, but blow me if I fancy steering for </p><p>the top of the world by dead reckoning, or no </p><p>reckoning at all,” Capt Arms said. </p><p> At night, of course, they had not even the</p><p>slight advantage that their observations of the </p><p>probable place of the sun gave them when it was </p><p>above the horizon. Then they had to go solely by </p><p>the indications of the compass. Still, they forged </p><p>steadily ahead, and when they got into what they </p><p>deemed the proper latitude, they ran for the site</p><p>of the drowned Sahara. </p><p> After about a week the billowing motion caused</p><p>by the descent of the ‘Hakes in the sky” ceased en- </p><p>tirely, to their great delight, but the lawless nebula </p><p>was now preparing another surprise for them. </p><p> On the ninth night after their departure from</p><p>their lodgment on the Palisades Cosmo Versal was </p><p>sleeping in his bunk close by the bridge, where he </p><p>could be called in an instant dreaming perhaps of </p><p>the glories of the new world that was to emerge out </p><p>of the deluge, when he was abruptly awakened by </p><p>the voice of Capt. Arms, who appeared to be labor- </p><p>ing under uncontrollable excitement. </p><p> “Tumble up quicker’n you ever did in your life!”</p><p>he exclaimed. “The flood’s over!” </p><p> Cosmo sprang out of bed and pulled on his coat</p><p>in a second. </p><p> “What do you mean?” he demanded.</p><p> “Look for yourself,” said the captain, pointing</p><p>overhead. </p><p> Cosmo Vers&amp;l glanced up and saw the sky blue</p><p>with stars! The rain had entirely ceased. The </p><p>surface of the sea was almost as smooth as glass, </p><p>though rising and falling slowly, with a long, roll- </p><p>ing motion. The Ark rode steadily, shivering, like </p><p>an ocean liner, under the impulse of its engines, </p><p>and the sudden silence, succeeding the ceaseless </p><p>roar of the downpour, which had never been out of </p><p>their ears from the start, of the voyage, seemed </p><p>supernatural. </p><p> “When did this happen?” he demanded.</p><p> “It began not more than five minutes ago. I was</p><p>858 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>just saying to myself that we ought to be some- </p><p>where near the center of the old Atlantic as it used </p><p>to be, and wondering whether we had got our course </p><p>laid right to go fairly between the Canaries and the </p><p>Cape de Verde, for I didn’t want to be harpooned </p><p>by Gogo or the Peak of Teneriffe, when all of a sud- </p><p>den there came a lightening in the nor’east and the </p><p>stars broke out there. </p><p> “I was so set aback that I didn't do anything for</p><p>two or three minutes but stare at the stars. Then </p><p>the rain stopped and a curtain seemed to roll off </p><p>the sky, and in a minute more it was clear down to </p><p>the horizon all round. Then I got my wits together </p><p>and ran to call you.” </p><p> Cosmo glanced around and above, seeming to be</p><p>as much astonished as the captain had been. He </p><p>rubbed his huge bald dome and looked all round </p><p>again before speaking. At last he said: </p><p> “It’s the nebula again. There must be a hole in</p><p>it.” </p><p> “Its whole bottom’s knocked out, I reckon,” said</p><p>the captain. “Maybe it’s run out of water—sort o’ </p><p>squeezed itself dry.” </p><p> Cosmo shook his head.</p><p> “We are not yet in the heart of it,” he said. "It</p><p>is evident to me now that what I took for the nu- </p><p>cleus was only a close-coiled spiral, and we’ve run </p><p>out of that, but the worst is yet to come. When we </p><p>strike the center, then we’ll catch it, and there’ll be </p><p>no more intermissions.” </p><p> "How long will that be?” asked Captain Arms.</p><p>“It may be a week and it may be a month, </p><p>though I hardly think it will be so long as that. The </p><p>earth is going about twelve miles a second—that’s </p><p>more than a million miles a day—directly toward </p><p>the center of the nebula. It has taken ten days to </p><p>go through the spiral that we have encountered, </p><p>making that about ten million miles thick. It’s not </p><p>likely that the gap between this spiral and the nuc- </p><p>leus of the nebula is more than thirty million miles </p><p>across, at the most; so you see we’ll probably be in </p><p>the nucleus within a month, and possibly much less </p><p>than a month.” </p><p> Captain Arms took a chew of tobacco.</p><p> “We can get our bearings now," he remarked.</p><p>“Look, there’s the moon just rising, and on my</p><p>word, she is going to occult Aldebaran within an </p><p>hour. I'll get an observation for longitude, and </p><p>another on Polaris for latitude. No running on </p><p>submerged mountains for us now.” </p><p> The captain was as good as his word, and when</p><p>his observations had been made and the calculations </p><p>completed he announced that the position of the </p><p>Ark was: Latitude, 16 degrees 10 minutes north; </p><p>longitude, 42 degrees 28 minutes west. </p><p> "Lucky for us,” he exclaimed, “that the sky</p><p>cleared. If we’d kept on as we were going we’d </p><p>have struck the Cape de Verde, and if that had </p><p>happened at night we’d probably have left our </p><p>bones on a drowning volcano. We ought to have </p><p>been ten or twelve degrees farther north to make </p><p>a safe passage over the-Sahara. What’s the course </p><p>now? Are you still for running down the Hima- </p><p>laya mountains?” </p><p> “I’ll decide later what to do,” said Cosmo Ver-</p><p>B&amp;l. “Make your northing, and then we’ll cruise </p><p>around a little and see what is best to be done.” </p><p> When day came on, brilliant with sunshine, and</p><p>the astonished passengers, hurrying out of their </p><p>bunks, crowded about the now opened gangways </p><p>and the port holes, which Cosmo had also ordered </p><p>to be opened, and gazed with delight upon the </p><p>smooth blue sea, the utmost enthusiasm took pos- </p><p>session of them. </p><p> The flood was over!</p><p> They were sure of it, and they shook hands</p><p>with one another and congratulated themselves and </p><p>hurrahed, and gave cheers for the Ark and cheers </p><p>for Cosmo Versal. Then they began to think of </p><p>their drowned homes and of their lost friends, and </p><p>sadness followed joy. Cosmo was mobbed by eager </p><p>inquirers wherever he made his appearance. </p><p> Was it all over for good? Would the flood dry</p><p>up in a few days? How long would it be before New </p><p>York would be free of water? Were they going </p><p>right back there? Did he think there was a chance </p><p>that many had escaped in boats and ships ? Couldn’t </p><p>they pick up the survivors if they hurried back? </p><p> Cosmo tried to check the enthusiasm.</p><p> “It's too early for rejoicing,” he assured them.</p><p>“It's only a break in the nebula. We’ve got a respite </p><p>for a short time, but there’s worse coming. The </p><p>drowning of the world will proceed. We are the </p><p>only survivors, except perhaps some of those who</p><p>inhabited the highlands. Everything less than </p><p>2,400 feet above the former level of the sea is now </p><p>under water. When the flood begins again it will </p><p>keep on until it is six miles deep over the old sea </p><p>margins.” </p><p> "Why not go back and try to rescue those who</p><p>you say may have found safety on the highlands?” </p><p>asked one. </p><p> "I have chosen my company,” he said “and I had</p><p>good reasons for the choice I made. I have already </p><p>added to the number, because simple humanity com- </p><p>pelled me, but I can take no more. The quantity of </p><p>provisions aboard the Ark is not greater than will </p><p>be needed by ourselves. If the rest of the world is </p><p>drowned it is not my fault. I did my best to warn </p><p>them. Besides, we could do nothing in the way of </p><p>rescue even if we should go back for that purpose. </p><p>We could not approach the submerged plateaus. </p><p>We would be aground before we got within sight of </p><p>them.” </p><p> These words went far to change the current of</p><p>feeling among the passengers. When they learned </p><p>that there would be danger for themselves in the </p><p>course that had been proposed their humanity prov- </p><p>ed to be less strong than their desire for self- </p><p>preservation. Nevertheless, as we shall see, the </p><p>Ark ultimately went back to America, though not </p><p>for any reason that had yet been suggested. </p><p> Meanwhile the unexpected respite furnished by</p><p>the sudden cessation of the downpour from the </p><p>sky had other important results, to which we now </p><p>turn. </p><p>CHAPTER XIV </p><p>Escape of the President </p><p>WHEN Professor Abiel Pludder indited his </p><p>savage response to Cosmo Versal’s invita- </p><p>tion to become one of the regenerators of </p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>859 </p><p>mankind by embarking in the Ark, he was express- </p><p>ing his professional prejudice rather than his intel- </p><p>lectual conviction. As Cosmo had remarked, Plud- </p><p>der had a good brain and great scientific acuteness, </p><p>and, although he did not believe in the nebular </p><p>theory of a flood, and was obstinately opposed to </p><p>everything that was not altogether regular and ac- </p><p>cording to recognized authority in science, yet he </p><p>could not shut his eyes to the fact that something </p><p>was going wrong in the machinery of the heavens. </p><p>But It annoyed him to find that his own explanations </p><p>were always falsified by the event, while Cosmo </p><p>Vers&amp;l seemed to have a superhuman fore-glimpse </p><p>of whatever happened. </p><p> His pride would not allow him to recede from</p><p>the position that he had taken, but he could not </p><p>free himself from a certain anxiety about the </p><p>future. After he had refused Cosmo Vers&amp;I’s In- </p><p>vitation, the course of events strengthened this </p><p>anxiety. He found that the official meteorologists </p><p>were totally unable to account for the marvelous </p><p>vagaries of the weather. </p><p> Finally, when the news came of tremendous</p><p>floods in the north, and of the overflowing of Hud- </p><p>son Bay, he secretly determined to make some pre- </p><p>parations of his own. He still rejected the idea of </p><p>a watery nebula, but he began to think it possible </p><p>that all the lowlands of the earth might be over- </p><p>flowed by the sea, and by the melting of mountain </p><p>snows and glaciers, together with deluging rain- </p><p>fall. After what had passed, he could not think of </p><p>making any public confession of his change of </p><p>heart, but his sense of humanity compelled him to </p><p>give confidential warning to his friends that it </p><p>would be well to be prepared to get on high ground </p><p>at a moment’s notice. </p><p> He was on the point of issuing, but without his</p><p>signature, an official statement cautioning the pub- </p><p>lic against unprecedented inundations, when the </p><p>first tidal wave arrived on the Atlantic coast and </p><p>rendered any utterance of that kind unnecessary. </p><p>People’s eyes were opened, and now they would </p><p>look out for themselves. </p><p>4$ludder’s private preparations amounted to no </p><p>more than the securing of a large express aero, in </p><p>which, if the necessity for suddenly leaving Wash- </p><p>ington should arise, he intended to take flight, to- </p><p>gether with President Samson, who was his per- </p><p>sonal friend, and a number of other close friends, </p><p>with their families. He did not think that it would </p><p>be necessary, in any event, to go farther than the</p><p>mountains of Virginia. </p><p> The rising of the sea, mounting higher at each</p><p>return, at length convinced him that the time had </p><p>come to get away. Hundreds of air craft had al- </p><p>ready departed westward, not only from Washing- </p><p>ton, but from New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, </p><p>Boston, and other seaboard cities, before Professor </p><p>Pludder assembled his friends by telephone on the </p><p>Capitol grounds, where his aero was waiting. </p><p> The lower streets of the city were under water</p><p>from the overflow of the Potomac, which was back- </p><p>ed up by the influx of the Atlantic into Chesapeake </p><p>Bay, and the most distressing scenes were enacted </p><p>there, people fleeing in the utmost disorder toward </p><p>higher ground, carrying their children and some </p><p>of their household goods, and uttering doleful cries. </p><p>Many, thinking it the best way to escape, embarked </p><p>in frail boats on the river, which was running up- </p><p>stream with, frightful velocity, and rising percep- </p><p>tibly higher every second. Most of these boats were </p><p>immediately overturned or swamped. </p><p> If the start had been delayed but a little longer,</p><p>the aero would have been mobbed by the excited </p><p>people, who uttered yells of disappointment and </p><p>rage when they saw it rise from its tower and sail </p><p>over the city. It was the last air-ship that left </p><p>Washington, and it carried the last persons who </p><p>escaped from the national capital before the down- </p><p>pour from the atmosphere began which put an end </p><p>to all possibility of getting away. </p><p> There were on board, in addition to a crew of</p><p>three, twenty-two persons. These included Presi- </p><p>dent Samson, with his wife and three children, </p><p>seven other men with their families, making, to- </p><p>gether, sixteen persons, and Professor Pludder, </p><p>who had no family. </p><p> More because they wished to escape from the</p><p>painful scenes beneath them than because they </p><p>deemed that there was any occasion for particular </p><p>haste, they started off at high speed, and it was </p><p>probably lucky for them that this speed was main- </p><p>tained after they had left Washington out of sight. </p><p>They rapidly approached the Blue Ridge in the </p><p>neighborhood of Luray, and Pludder was about to </p><p>order a landing there, as night was approaching, </p><p>when with great suddenness the sky filled with </p><p>dense clouds and a tremendous downpour began. </p><p>This was the same phenomenon which has already </p><p>been described as following closely the attack at </p><p>New York on Cosmo Versal's Ark. </p><p> The aero, luckily, was one of the best type, and</p><p>well covered, so that they were protected from the </p><p>terrible force of the rain, but in the tumult there </p><p>could be no more thought of descending. It would </p><p>have been impossible to make a landing in the midst </p><p>of the storm and the pouring water, which rushed </p><p>in torrents down the mountainside. Professor Plud- </p><p>der was a brave man and full of resources when </p><p>driven into a corner. Being familiar with the con- </p><p>struction and management of aeros, for he had been </p><p>educated as an engineer, he now took charge of the </p><p>airship. </p><p> Within twenty minutes after the sky had opened</p><p>its batteries—for the rain had almost the force of </p><p>plunging shot—a mighty wind arose, and the aero, </p><p>pitching, tossing, and dipping like a mad thing, was </p><p>driven with frightful speed eastward. This wild </p><p>rush continued for more than an hour. By this </p><p>time it was full night, and the pouring rain around </p><p>them was as impenetrable to the sight as a black </p><p>wall. </p><p> They had their electric lamps inside, and their</p><p>search-lights, but it was impossible to tell where </p><p>they were. Pludder turned the search-light down- </p><p>ward, but he could not make out the features of the </p><p>ground beneath them. It is likely that they were </p><p>driven at least as far as Chesapeake Bay, and they </p><p>may have passed directly over Washington. </p><p> At last, however, the wind slewed round, and be-</p><p>gan to blow with undiminished violence from the </p><p>northeast. Plunging and swerving, and sometimes </p><p>860 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>threatened with a complete somersault, the aero </p><p>hurried away in its crazy flight, while its un- </p><p>fortunate inmates clung to one another, and held on </p><p>by any object within reach, in the endeavor to keep </p><p>from being dashed against the metallic walls. </p><p> The crew of the aero were picked men, but no</p><p>experience could have prepared them for the work </p><p>which they now had to do. Without the ready </p><p>brain of Professor PI udder to direct their efforts, </p><p>and without his personal exertions, their aerial </p><p>ship would have been wrecked within a quarter of </p><p>an hour after the storm struck it. He seemed trans- </p><p>formed into another person. Hatless and coatless, </p><p>and streaming with water, he worked like a demon. </p><p>He was ready at each emergency with some device </p><p>which, under his direction, had the effect of magic. </p><p> A hundred times the aero plunged for the ground,</p><p>but was saved and turned upward again just as it </p><p>seemed on the point of striking. Up and down, </p><p>right and left, it ran and pitched and whirled, like </p><p>a cork in a whirlpool. Sometimes it actually skim- </p><p>med the ground, plowing its way through a torrent </p><p>of rushing water, and yet it rose again and was </p><p>saved from destruction. </p><p> This terrible contest lasted another hour after</p><p>the turning of the wind, and then the latter died </p><p>out. Relieved from its pressure, the aero ran on </p><p>with comparative ease. Professor Pludder, suspect- </p><p>ing that they might now be getting into a moun- </p><p>tainous district, made every effort to keep the craft </p><p>at a high elevation, and this, notwithstanding the </p><p>depressing force of the rain, they succeeded in do- </p><p>ing. After the dying out of the wind they kept on, </p><p>by the aid of their propellers, in the same direction </p><p>in which it had been driving them, because, in the </p><p>circumstances, one way was as good as another. </p><p> The terrible discomfort of the President and his</p><p>companions in the cabin of the aero was greatly </p><p>relieved by the cessation of the wind, but still they </p><p>were in a most unfortunate state. The rain, driven </p><p>by the fierce blasts, had penetrated through every </p><p>crevice, and they were drenched to the skin. No </p><p>one tried to speak, for it would have been almost </p><p>impossible to make oneself heard amid the uproar. </p><p>They simply looked at one another in dismay and </p><p>prayed for safety. </p><p> Professor Pludder, not now compelled to spend</p><p>every moment in the management of the craft, </p><p>entered the cabin occasionally, pressed the hand of </p><p>the President, smiled encouragingly on the women</p><p>and children, and did all he could, in pantomime, to </p><p>restore some degree of confidence. Inside, the </p><p>lights were aglow, but outside it was as dark as </p><p>pitch, except where the broad finger of the search- </p><p>light, plunging into the mass of tumbling water, </p><p>glittered and flashed. </p><p> The awful night seemed endless, but at last a pale</p><p>illumination appeared in the air, and they knew that </p><p>day had come. The spectacle of the sky de- </p><p>luge was now so terrible that it struck cold even to </p><p>their already benumbed hearts. The atmosphere </p><p>seemed to have been turned into a mighty cataract </p><p>thundering down upon the whole face of the earth. </p><p>Now that they could see as well as hear, the miracle </p><p>of the preservation of the aero appeared incredible. </p><p> As the light slowly brightened, Professor Plud-</p><p>der, constantly on the outlook, caught a glimpse of </p><p>a dark, misty object ahead. It loomed up so sud- </p><p>denly, and was already so close, that before he could </p><p>sufficiently alter the course of the aero, it struck </p><p>with such violence as to crush the forward end of </p><p>the craft and break one of the planes. Everybody </p><p>was pitched headforemost, those inside falling on the </p><p>flooring, while Pludder and the three men of the </p><p>crew were thrown out upon a mass of rocks. AD </p><p>were more or less seriously injured, but none was . </p><p>killed or totally disabled. </p><p> Pludder sprang to hjs feet, and, slipping and</p><p>plunging amid the downpour, managed to get back </p><p>to the wreck and aid the President and the others </p><p>to get upon their feet. </p><p> “We’re lodged on a mountain!” he yelled. “Stay</p><p>inside, under the shelter of the roof!” </p><p> The three men who, together with the professor,</p><p>had been precipitated out among the rocks, also </p><p>scrambled in, and there they stood, or sat, the most </p><p>disconsolate and despairing group of human beings </p><p>that ever the eye of an overseeing Providence looked </p><p>down upon. </p><p> The President presented the most pitiable sight</p><p>of all. Like the rest, his garments were sopping, </p><p>his eyes were bloodshot, his face was ghastly, and </p><p>his tall silk hat, which he had jammed down upon </p><p>his brow, had been softened by the water and crush- </p><p>ed by repeated blows into the form of a closed ac- </p><p>cordion- Of the women and children it is needless </p><p>to speak; no description could convey an idea of </p><p>their condition. </p><p> In these circumstances, the real strength of Pro-</p><p>fessor Abiel Pludder’s mind was splendidly display-</p><p>ed. He did not lose his head, and he comprehended </p><p>the situation, and what it was necessary to do, in a </p><p>flash. He got out some provisions and distributed </p><p>them to the company, in some cases actually forcing </p><p>them to eat.' With his own hands he prepared cof- </p><p>fee, with the apparatus always carried by express </p><p>aeros, and made them drink it. </p><p> When all had thus been refreshed he approached</p><p>President Samson and shouted in his ear: </p><p> “We shall have to stay here until the downpour</p><p>ceases. To guard against the effects of a tempeBt, </p><p>if one should arise, we must secure the aero in its </p><p>place. For that I need the aid of every man in the </p><p>party. We have, fortunately, struck in a spot on </p><p>the mountain where we are out of the way of the </p><p>torrents of water that are pouring down through </p><p>the ravines on either side. We can make our </p><p>lodgment secure, but we must go to work imme- </p><p>diately.” </p><p> Stimulated by his example, the President and the</p><p>others set to work, and with great difficulty, for </p><p>they had to guard their eyes and nostrils from the </p><p>driving rain, which, sometimes, in spite of their </p><p>precautions, nearly smothered them, they succeeded </p><p>in fastening the aero to the rocks by means of </p><p>metallic cables taken from its stores. When this </p><p>work was finished they returned under the shelter </p><p>of the cabin roof and lay down, exhausted. So worn </p><p>out were they that all of them quickly fell into a </p><p>troubled sleep. </p><p> It would be needless to relate in detail the suf-</p><p>ferings, mental and physical, that they underwent </p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>861 </p><p>daring the next ten days. While they were hanging </p><p>there on the mountain the seaboard cities of the </p><p>world were drowned, and Cosmo Vers&amp;l’s Ark de- </p><p>parted on the remarkable voyage that has been des- </p><p>cribed in a former chapter. They had plenty of </p><p>provisions, for the aero had been well stored, but </p><p>partly through precaution and partly because of </p><p>lack of appetite they ate sparingly. The electric </p><p>generators of the aero had not been injured in the </p><p>wreck of the craft, and they were able to supply </p><p>themselves with sufficient heat and with light inside </p><p>the cabin at night. </p><p> Once they had a strange visitor—a half-drowned</p><p>bear, which had struggled up the mountain from </p><p>its den somewhere below—but that was the only </p><p>living creature beside themselves that they saw. </p><p>After gazing wistfully at the aero from the top of a </p><p>rock the poor bear stumbled into one of the torrents </p><p>that poured furiously down on each side, and was </p><p>swept from their sight. </p><p> Fortunately, the wind that they had anticipated</p><p>did not come, but frequently they saw or heard the </p><p>roaring downpours of solid watery columns like </p><p>those that had so much astonished Cosmo Vers&amp;l </p><p>and Captain Arms in the midst of the Atlantic, but </p><p>none came very near them. </p><p> Professor Pludder ventured out from time to</p><p>time, clambering a little way up and down the pro- </p><p>jecting ridge of the mountain on which they were </p><p>lodged, and at length was able to assure his com- </p><p>panions that they were on the northwestern face of </p><p>Mount Mitchell, the highest peak of the Appalach- </p><p>ian range. With the aid of his pocket aneroid, mak- </p><p>ing allowance for the effect of the lifting of the </p><p>whole atmosphere by the flood, and summoning his </p><p>knowledge of the locality—for he had explored, in </p><p>former years, all the mountains in this region—he </p><p>arrived at the conclusion that their place of refuge </p><p>was elevated about four thousand feet above the </p><p>former level of the sea. </p><p> At first their range of vision did not allow them</p><p>to see the condition of the valleys below them, but </p><p>as the water rose higher it gradually came into </p><p>view. It crept steadily up the slopes beneath, which </p><p>had already been stripped of their covering of trees </p><p>and vegetation by the force of the descending tor- </p><p>rents, until on the tenth day it had arrived almost </p><p>within reach. Since, as has just been said, they </p><p>were four thousand feet above the former level of </p><p>the sea, it will be observed that the water must </p><p>have risen much more rapidly than the measure-</p><p>ments of Cosmo Vera&amp;l indicated. Its average rate </p><p>of rise had been three instead of two inches per </p><p>minute, and the world was buried deeper than </p><p>Cosmo thought. The cause of his error will be ex- </p><p>plained later. </p><p> The consternation of the little party when they</p><p>thus beheld the rapid drowning of the world below </p><p>them, and saw no possibility of escape for them- </p><p>selves if the water continued to rise, as it evidently </p><p>would do, cannot be depicted. Some of them were </p><p>driven insane, and were with difficulty prevented </p><p>by those who retained their senses from throwing </p><p>themselves into the flood. </p><p> Pludder was the only one who maintained a</p><p>command over hia nerves, although he now at last </p><p>believed in the nebula. He recognized that there </p><p>was no other possible explanation of the flood than </p><p>that which Cosmo Vers&amp;l had offered long before it </p><p>began. In his secret heart he had no expectation of </p><p>ultimate escape, yet he was strong enough to con- </p><p>tinue to encourage his companions with hopes which </p><p>he could not himself entertain. </p><p> When, after nightfall on the tenth day, the water</p><p>began to lap the lower parts of the aero, he was on </p><p>the point of persuading the party to clamber up the </p><p>rocks in search of some shelter above, but as he </p><p>stepped out of the door &lt;1 * 'he cabin to reconnoiter </p><p>the way, with the aid of. search-light which he </p><p>had turned up along the rf&amp;ge, he was astonished to </p><p>find the rain rapidly diminishing in force; and a </p><p>few minutes later it ceased entirely, and the stars </p><p>shone out. </p><p> The sudden cessation of the roar upon the roof</p><p>brought everybody to his feet, and before Profes- </p><p>sor Pludder could communicate the good news all </p><p>were out under the sky, rejoicing and offering </p><p>thanks for their delivery. The women were es- </p><p>pecially affected. They wept in one another's arm3, </p><p>or convulsively clasped their children to their </p><p>breasts. </p><p> At length the President found his voice.</p><p> “What haa happened?” he asked.</p><p> Professor Pludder, with the new light that had</p><p>come to him, was as ready with an explanation as </p><p>Cosmo Varsal himself had been under similar cir- </p><p>cumstances. </p><p> “We must have run out of the nebula."</p><p> “The nebula I” returned Mr. Samson in surprise.</p><p>“Has there been a nebula, then?” </p><p> “Without question,” was the professor's answer.</p><p>“Nothing but an encounter with a watery nebula </p><p>could have had such a result.” </p><p> “But you always said—*’ began the President.</p><p> "Yes,” Pludder broke in, “but one may be In er-</p><p>ror sometimes.” </p><p> “Then, Cosmo Versal—”</p><p> “Let us not discuss Cosmo Vers&amp;l,” exclaimed</p><p>Professor Pludder, with a return of his old dic- </p><p>tatorial manner. </p><p>CHAPTER XV </p><p>Professor Pludder’s Device </p><p>DAY dawned brilliantly on Mount Mitchell </p><p>and revealed to the astonished eyes of the </p><p>watchers an endless expanse of water, </p><p>gleaming and sparkling in the morning sunlight. </p><p>It was a spectacle at once beautiful and fearful, and </p><p>calculated to make their hearts sink with pity no less </p><p>than with terror. But for a time they were dis- </p><p>tracted from the awful thoughts which such a sight </p><p>must inspire by anxiety concerning themselves. </p><p>They could not drive away the fear that, at any </p><p>moment, the awful clouds might return and the </p><p>terrible downpour be resumed. </p><p> But Professor Pludder, whose comprehension of</p><p>the cause of the deluge was growing clearer the </p><p>more he thought about it, did not share the anxiety </p><p>of the President and the others. </p><p> “The brightness of the sky,” he said, "shows that</p><p>there is no considerable quantity of condensing </p><p>862 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>vapor left in the atmosphere. If the earth has run </p><p>out of the nebula, that is likely to be the end of the </p><p>thing. If there is more of the nebulous matter in </p><p>surrounding space we may miss it entirely, or, if </p><p>not, a long time would elapse before we came upon </p><p>it. </p><p> “The gaps that exist in nebulse are millions of</p><p>miles across, and the earth would require days and </p><p>weeks to go such distances, granting that it were </p><p>traveling in the proper direction. I think it alto- </p><p>gether probable that this nebula, which must be a </p><p>small one as such things go, consists of a single </p><p>mass, and that, having traversed it, we are done </p><p>with it. We are out of our troubles.” </p><p> “Well, hardly,” said the President. “Here we</p><p>are, prisoners on a mountain, with no way of get- </p><p>ting down, the whole land beneath being turned in- </p><p>to a sea. We can’t stay here indefinitely. For how </p><p>long a time are we provisioned?” </p><p> “We have compressed food enough to last this</p><p>party a month,” replied Professor Pludder; “that is </p><p>to say, if we are sparing of it. For water we can- </p><p>not lack, since this that surrounds us is not salt, and </p><p>if it were we could manage to distil it. But, of </p><p>course, when I said we were out of our troubles I </p><p>meant only that there was no longer any danger of </p><p>being swallowed up by the flood. It is true that we </p><p>cannot think of remaining here. We must get off.” </p><p>“But how? Where can we go?” </p><p> Professor Pludder thought a long time before he</p><p>answered this question. Finally he said, measuring </p><p>his words: </p><p> “The water is four thousand feet above the</p><p>former level of the sea. There is no land sufficiently </p><p>lofty to rise above it this side of the Colorado plat- </p><p>eau.” </p><p> “And how far is that?”</p><p> “Not less than eleven hundred miles in an air</p><p>line.” </p><p> The President shuddered.</p><p> “Then, all this vast country of ours from here to</p><p>the feet of the Rocky Mountains is now under water </p><p>thousands of feet deep!” </p><p> “There can be no doubt of it. The Atlantic</p><p>Coast States, the Southern States, the Mississippi</p><p>Valley, the region of the Great Lakes, and Canada </p><p>are now a part of the Atlantic Ocean.” </p><p> “And all the great cities — gone! Merciful</p><p>Father! What a thought!” </p><p> The President mused for a time, and gradually a</p><p>frown came upon his brow. He glanced at Profes- </p><p>sor Pludder with a singular look. Then his cheek </p><p>reddened, and an angry expression came into his </p><p>eyes. Suddenly he turned to the professor and said </p><p>sternly: </p><p> “You said you did not wish to discuss Cosmo</p><p>Varsal. I should not think you would! Who pre- </p><p>dicted this deluge? Did you?” </p><p> “I—” began Professor Pludder, taken aback by</p><p>the President’s manner. </p><p> “Oh, yes,” interrupted the President, “I know</p><p>what you would say. You didn’t predict it because </p><p>you didn’t see it coming. But why didn’t </p><p>you see it? What have we got observatories </p><p>and scientific societies for if they can’t see or com- </p><p>prehend anything? Didn’t Cosmo Vers&amp;l warn you? </p><p>Didn’t he tell you where to look, and what to look </p><p>for? Didn’t he show you his proofs?” </p><p> “We thought they were fallacious,” stammered</p><p>Professor Pludder. </p><p> “You thought they were fallacious—well, were</p><p>they fallacious? Does this spectacle of a nation </p><p>drowned look ‘fallacious’ to you? Why didn’t you </p><p>study the matter until you understood it? Why </p><p>did you issue officially, and with my ignorant sanc- </p><p>tion—may God forgive me for my blindness!— </p><p>statement after statement, assuring the people that </p><p>there was no danger—statements that were even </p><p>abusive towards him who alone should have been </p><p>heard? </p><p> “And yet, as now appears, you knew nothing</p><p>about it. Millions upon millions have perished </p><p>through your obstinate opposition to the truth. </p><p>They might have saved themselves if they had </p><p>been permitted to listen to the reiterated warnings </p><p>of Cosmo Versal. </p><p> “Oh, if I had only listened to him, and issued a</p><p>proclamation as he urged me to do! But I fol- </p><p>lowed your advice—you, in whose learning and pre- </p><p>tended science I put blind faith! Abiel Pludder, I </p><p>would not have upon my soul the weight that now </p><p>rests on yours for all the wealth that the lost world </p><p>carried down into its watery grave!”</p><p> As the President ceased speaking he turned away</p><p>and sank upon a rock, pressing his hands upon his </p><p>throat to suppress the sobs that broke forth despite </p><p>his efforts. His form shook like an aspen. </p><p> The others crowded around excitedly, some of</p><p>the women in hysterics, and the men not knowing </p><p>what to do or say. Professor Pludder, completely </p><p>overwhelmed by the suddenness and violence of the </p><p>attack, went off by himself and sat down with hi3 </p><p>head in his hands. After a while he arose and ap- </p><p>proached the President, who had not moved from </p><p>his place on the rock. </p><p> “George,” he said—they had known each other</p><p>from boyhood—“I have made a terrible mistake. </p><p>And yet I was not alone in it. The majority of my </p><p>colleagues were of my opinion, as were all the </p><p>learned societies of Europe. No such thing as a </p><p>watery nebula has ever been known to science. It </p><p>was inconceivable.” </p><p> “Some of your colleagues did not think so,” said</p><p>the President, looking up. </p><p> “But they were not really convinced, and they</p><p>were aware that they were flying in the face of all </p><p>known laws.” </p><p> “I am afraid,” said the President dryly, “that</p><p>science does not know all the laws of the universe </p><p>yet.” </p><p> “I repeat,” resumed Professor Pludder, “that I</p><p>made a fearful mistake. I have recognized the truth </p><p>too late. I accept the awful burden of blame that </p><p>rests upon me, and I now wish to do everything in </p><p>my power to retrieve the consequences of my error.” </p><p>The President arose and grasped the professor’s </p><p>hand. </p><p> “Forgive me, Abiel,” he said, with emotion, “if</p><p>I have spoken too much in the manner of a judge </p><p>pronouncing sentence. I was overwhelmed by the </p><p>thought of the inconceivable calamity that has come </p><p>upon us. I believe that you acted conscientiously </p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>863 </p><p>and according to your best lights, and it is not for </p><p>any mortal to judge you for an error thus commit- </p><p>ted. Let us think only of what we must do now.” </p><p> “To that thought,” responded Professor Pludder,</p><p>returning the pressure of the President’s hand, “I </p><p>shall devote all my energy. If I can save only this </p><p>little party I shall have done something in the way </p><p>of atonement.” </p><p> It was a deep humiliation for a man of Profes-</p><p>sor Pludder’s proud and uncompromising nature to </p><p>confess that he had committed an error more fear- </p><p>ful in its consequences than had ever been laid at </p><p>the door of a human being, but Cosmo Versal had </p><p>rightly judged him when he assured Joseph Smith </p><p>that Pludder was morally sound, and, in a scientific </p><p>sense, had the root of the matter in him. When his </p><p>mental vision was clear, and unclouded by prejud- </p><p>ice, no one was more capable of high achievements. </p><p> He quickly proved his capacity now, as he had al-</p><p>ready proved it during the preceding adventures of </p><p>the President's party. It was perfectly plain to him </p><p>that their only chance was in getting to Colorado </p><p>at the earliest possible moment. The eastern part </p><p>of the continent was hopelessly buried, and even on </p><p>the high plains of the Middle West the fury of the </p><p>downpour might have spread universal disaster and </p><p>destroyed nearly all the vegetation; but, in any </p><p>event, it was there alone that the means of prolong- </p><p>ing life could be sought. </p><p> With the problem squarely before his mind, he</p><p>was not long in finding a solution. His first step </p><p>was to make a thorough examination of the aero, </p><p>with the hope that the damage that it had suffered </p><p>might be reparable. He had all the tools that would </p><p>be needed, as it was the custom for express aeros </p><p>to carry a complete equipment for repairs; but un- </p><p>fortunately one of the planes of the aero was </p><p>wrecked beyond the possibility of repair. He knew </p><p>upon what delicate adjustments the safety of the </p><p>modern airship depended, and he did not dare un- </p><p>dertake a voyage with a lame craft. </p><p> Then the idea occurred to him of trying to escape</p><p>by water. The aero was a machine of the very lat- </p><p>est type, and made of levium, consequently it would </p><p>float better than wood. </p><p> If the opposition of ship-builders, incited and</p><p>backed by selfish interests, had not prevented the </p><p>employment of levium in marine construction, mil- </p><p>lions of lives might now have been saved; but, as</p><p>we have before said, only a few experimental boats </p><p>of levium had been made. </p><p> Moreover, like all aeros intended for long trips,</p><p>this one had what was called a “boat-bottom,” in- </p><p>tended to enable it to remain afloat with its burden </p><p>in case of an accidental fall into a large body of </p><p>water. Pludder saw that this fact would enable him </p><p>to turn the wreck into a raft. </p><p> It would only be necessary to reshape the craft a</p><p>little, and this was the easier because the aero was </p><p>put together in such a manner with screw-bolts and </p><p>nuts that it could be articulated or disarticulated as </p><p>readily as a watch. He had entire confidence in his </p><p>engineering skill, and in the ability of the three </p><p>experienced men of the crew to aid him. He decided </p><p>to employ the planes for outriders, which would </p><p>serve to increase the buoyancy and stability. </p><p> As soon as he had completed his plan in his mind</p><p>he explained his intentions to the President. The </p><p>latter and the other members of the party were at </p><p>first as much startled as surprised by the idea of </p><p>embarking on a voyage of eleven hundred miles in </p><p>so questionable a craft, but Professor Pludder as- </p><p>sured them that everything would go well. </p><p> “But how about the propulsion?” asked Mr. Sam-</p><p>son. “You can’t depend on the wind, and we've got </p><p>no sails.” </p><p> “I have thought that all out,” said Pludder. “I</p><p>shall use the engine, and rearrange one of the aerial </p><p>screws so that it will serve for a propeller. I do not </p><p>expect to get up any great speed, but if we can </p><p>make only as much as two miles an hour we shall </p><p>arrive on the borders of the Colorado upland, five </p><p>thousand feet above sea, within about twenty-three </p><p>days. We may be able to do better than that.” </p><p> Nobody felt much confidence in this scheme ex-</p><p>cept its inventor, but it appeared to be the only </p><p>thing that could be done, and so they all fell to </p><p>work, each aiding as best he could, and after four </p><p>days of hard work the remarkable craft was ready </p><p>for its adventurous voyage. </p><p> Professor Pludder had succeeded even better than</p><p>he anticipated in transforming one of the aerial </p><p>screws into a propeller. Its original situation was </p><p>such that it naturally, as it were, fell into the prop- </p><p>er place when the “hull” was partly submerged, </p><p>and, the blades being made of concentric rows of </p><p>small plates, there was no difficulty in reducing </p><p>them to a manageable size. The position of the en- </p><p>gine did not need to be changed at all. </p><p> The “outriders,” made up of the discarded</p><p>planes, promised to serve their purpose well, and the </p><p>cabin remained for a comfortable “deck-house.” A </p><p>rudder had been contrived by an alteration of the </p><p>one which had served for guiding the aero in its </p><p>flights. </p><p> The water was close to their feet, and there was</p><p>no great difficulty in pushing the affair off the rocks </p><p>and getting it afloat. The women and children were </p><p>first put aboard, and then the men scrambled </p><p>in, and Pludder set the motors going. The im- </p><p>provised propeller churned and spluttered, but it </p><p>did its work after a fashion, and, under a blue sky, </p><p>in dazzling sunshine, with a soft southerly breeze </p><p>fanning the strange sea that spread around them, </p><p>they soon saw the bared rocks and deeply scored </p><p>flanks of Mount Mitchell receding behind them. </p><p> They were delighted to find that they were mak-</p><p>ing, at the very start, no less than three miles an </p><p>hour. Pludder clapped his hands and exclaimed: </p><p> “This is capital! In but little over two weeks we</p><p>shall be safe on the great plains. I have good hope </p><p>that many have survived there, and that we shall </p><p>find a plenty of everything needed. With the in- </p><p>struments that were aboard the aero I can make </p><p>observations to determine our position, and I shall </p><p>steer for the Pike’s Peak region.” </p><p> When the party had become accustomed to their</p><p>situation, and had gained confidence in their craft </p><p>by observing how buoyantly it bore them, they be- </p><p>came almost cheerful in their demeanor. The </p><p>children gradually lost all fear, and, with the </p><p>thoughtless joy of childhood in the pleasures and </p><p>To </p><p>PRACTICAL MEN </p><p>and </p><p>ELECTRICAL </p><p>STUDENTS </p><p> You can me this marvelous little</p><p>book for solving your problems in any </p><p>phase of electricity including Motor </p><p>Starters and Starting Boxes, Overload </p><p>and Underload Release Boxes, Rever- </p><p>sible Types, Elevator Controllers, </p><p>Tank Controllers, Starters for Printing </p><p>Press Motors, Automatic Controllers, </p><p>Variable Field Type, Controllers for </p><p>Mine Locomotive, Street Car Control- </p><p>lers, Connections for Reversing </p><p>Switches, Motor and Dynamo Rules, </p><p>Rules for Speed Regulation, Connec* </p><p>tions for Induction Motors and Start- </p><p>ers, Delta and Star Connections, Con- </p><p>nections for Auto Transformers, and </p><p>Transformers for Lightning and Power </p><p>Purposes. </p><p> If you are interested in calculation</p><p>you can find plenty of it in the various </p><p>work on Simple Electrical Mathemat- </p><p>ics, Electrical Units, Electrical Con- </p><p>nections, Calculation of Unknown Re- </p><p>sistances, Calculation of Current in </p><p>Branches of Parallel Circuits, Calcu- </p><p>lation of Weight of Wire, Wire Gauge </p><p>Rules, Orm’9 Law, Watt’s Law, Infor- </p><p>mation regarding Wire used for Elec- </p><p>trical Purposes, Wire Calculations, </p><p>Wiring Calculations, Illumination Cal- </p><p>culations, Shunt Instruments and Cal- </p><p>culation of Resistance of Shunts, </p><p>Power Calculations, Efficiency Calcu- </p><p>lations, Measuring of Unknown Resist- </p><p>ances, Dynamo and Dynamo Troubles, </p><p>Motors and Motor Troubles, Calcula- </p><p>tion of Size of Pulleys, Current Calcu- </p><p>lations in finding Impedance, React- </p><p>ance, Inductance, Frequency, Speed of </p><p>Alternators and Motors, Conductance, </p><p>Susceptance, Admittance, Angle of </p><p>Lag and Power Factor, and Formulas </p><p>for use with Line Transformers. </p><p>ARE YOU INTERESTED </p><p>IN ELECTRICITY? </p><p> If you are, this is your opportunity to get a book which is as</p><p>authentic as it is complete!

SERVISS </p><p>(Continued) </p><p>wonders of the present moment, </p><p>amused themselves in the cabin, and </p><p>about the deck, which had been sur- </p><p>rounded with guard lines made of </p><p>wire cable. </p><p> The water was almost waveless, and,</p><p>if no storm should arise, there ap- </p><p>peared to be no reason for anxiety </p><p>concerning the outcome of their ad- </p><p>venture. But as they drove slowly </p><p>on over the submerged range of the </p><p>Great Smokies, and across the valleys </p><p>of Eastern Tennessee, and then over </p><p>the Cumberland range, and so out </p><p>above the lowlands, they could not </p><p>keep their thoughts from turning to </p><p>what lay beneath that fearful ocean. </p><p>And occasionally something floated to </p><p>the surface that wrenched their heart- </p><p>strings and caused them to avert </p><p>their faces. </p><p> Professor Pludder kept them in-</p><p>formed of their location. Now they </p><p>were over central Tennessee; now </p><p>Nashville lay more than three thou- </p><p>sand feet beneath their keel; now </p><p>they were crossing the valley of the </p><p>Tennessee River; now the great Miss- </p><p>issippi was under them, hidden deep </p><p>beneath the universal flood; now they </p><p>were over the highlands of southern </p><p>Missouri; and now over those of </p><p>Kansas. </p><p> “George,” said Professor Pludder</p><p>me day, addressing the President, </p><p>with more emotion than was often to </p><p>oe detected in his voice, “would you </p><p>ike to know what is beneath us now?” </p><p>“What is it, Abiel?” </p><p> “Our boyhood home—Wichita.”</p><p> The President bowed his head upon</p><p>lis hands and groaned. </p><p> “Yes,” continued Professor Pludder</p><p>nusingly, “there it lies, three thou- </p><p>sand feet deep. There is the Arkansas, </p><p>ilong whose banks we used to play, </p><p>.vith its golden waters now mingling </p><p>feebly with the mighty flood that</p><p>covers them. There is the school </p><p>louse and the sandy road where we </p><p>ran races barefoot in the hot summer </p><p>iust. There is your father's house, </p><p>ind mine, and the homes of all our </p><p>?arly friends—and where are they? </p><p>Would to God that I had not been so </p><p>Dlind!” </p><p> “But there was another not so</p><p>Dlind,” said the President, with some- </p><p>thing of the condemnatory manner </p><p>)f his former speech. </p><p> “I know it—I know it too well</p><p>low," returned the professor. “But </p><p>io not condemn me, George, for what </p><p>[ did not foresee and could not help.” </p><p>“I am sorry, said the' President </p><p>jadJy, “that you have awakened those </p><p>jfd jnemorka. But I do not condemn </p><p>you, though I condemn your science— </p><p>or your lack of science. But we can </p><p>do nothing. Let us speak of it no </p><p>more.” </p><p> The weather was wonderful, con-</p><p>sidering what had so recently occur- </p><p>red. No clouds formed in the sky, </p><p>there was only a gentle breeze stir- </p><p>ring, at night, the heavens glittered </p><p>with starry gems, and by day the sun </p><p>shone so hotly that awnings were </p><p>spread over those whose duties re- </p><p>quired them to be employed outside </p><p>the shelter of the cabin. The impro- </p><p>vised propeller and rudder worked to </p><p>admiration, and some days they made </p><p>as much as eighty miles in the twenty- </p><p>four hours. </p><p> At length, on the fourteenth day of</p><p>their strange voyage, they caught </p><p>sight of a curiously shaped “pike” that </p><p>projected above the horizon far to the </p><p>west. At the same time they saw, not </p><p>far away, toward the north and to- </p><p>ward the south, a low line, like a sea- </p><p>beach. </p><p> “We are getting into shallow water</p><p>now,” said Professor Pludder. “I </p><p>have been following the course of the </p><p>Arkansas in order to be sure of a suf- </p><p>ficient depth, but now we must be very </p><p>careful. We are close to the site of Las </p><p>Animas, which is surrounded with</p><p>land rising four thousand feet above </p><p>sea level. If we should get aground </p><p>there would be no hope for us. That </p><p>peak in the distance is Pike’s Peak.” </p><p> “And what is that long line of</p><p>beach that stretches on the north and </p><p>south?” asked the President. </p><p> “It is the topographic line of four</p><p>thousand feet,” replied the professor. </p><p> “And we shall encounter it ahead.”</p><p> “Yes, it makes a curve about Las</p><p>Animas, and then the land lies at an </p><p>average elevation of four thousand </p><p>feet, until it takes another rise beyond </p><p>Pueblo.” </p><p> “But we cannot sail across this half-</p><p>submerged area,” said the President. </p><p> “There are depressions,” Professor</p><p>Pludder responded, “and I hope to be </p><p>able to follow their traces until we </p><p>reach land that still lies well above </p><p>the water.'' </p><p> Near nightfall they got so close to</p><p>the “beach” that they could hear the </p><p>surf, not a thundering sound, but a </p><p>soft, rippling wash of the slight </p><p>waves. The water about them was </p><p>ruddy with thick sediment. Profes- </p><p>sor Pludder did not dare to venture </p><p>farther in the coming darkness, and </p><p>he dropped overboard two of the aero’s </p><p>grapples, which he had heavily </p><p>weighted and attached to wire cables. </p><p>TheR took the groand at a depth of </p><p> !ity</p><p> GifU</p><p> RatlnfjcUoo jumnlijh' oxinar</p><p> loo Diamond Biogn bHowd b«r» *r©</p><p> aJI cxqmvKo creations io solid 18-fc</p><p> .

There was no wind and </p><p>no perceptible current, and so they </p><p>rode alt night at anchor off this </p><p>strangest of coasts. </p><p> At daybreak they pulled up their</p><p>anchors, and went in search of the de- </p><p>pressions of which the professor had </p><p>spoken. So accurate was his topo- </p><p>graphic knowledge and so great his </p><p>skill, that late in the afternoon they </p><p>saw a tall chimney projecting above </p><p>the water a little ahead. </p><p> “There’s all that remains of</p><p>Pueblo,” said Professor Pludder. </p><p> They anchored again that night, and</p><p>the next day, cautiously approaching </p><p>a bluff that arose precipitously from </p><p>the water, their hearts were glad- </p><p>dened by the sight of three men, </p><p>standing on a bluff? excitedly beckon- </p><p>ing to them, and shouting at the top </p><p>of their voices. </p><p>(To be concluded next month) </p><p>other word, went into the hall. But </p><p>when his face was no longer visible </p><p>to Trant, the hanging pouches under </p><p>his eyes grew leaden gray, his fat </p><p>lips fell apart loosely, his step shuf- </p><p>fled ; his mask had fallen! </p><p>“Besides, we need all the men we </p><p>have, I think,” said Trant, turning </p><p>back to the prisoners, “to get these </p><p>to a safe place. Miss Rowan,” he </p><p>turned then and put out his hand to </p><p>steady the terrified and weeping girl, </p><p>“I warned you that you had probably </p><p>better not come here to-night. But </p><p>since you have come and have had </p><p>pain because of your stepfather’s </p><p>wrong doings, I am glad to be able to </p><p>give you the additional assurance, be- </p><p>yond the fact, which you have heard, </p><p>that your fianc6 was not murdered, </p><p>but merely put away on board the </p><p>Elizabethan Age; that he is safe and</p><p>sound, except for a few bruises, and, </p><p>moreover, we expect him here any </p><p>moment now. The police are bring- </p><p>ing him down from Boston on the </p><p>train which arrives at ten.” </p><p> He went to the window and watched</p><p>an instant, as Dickey and Rentland, </p><p>having telephoned for a patrol, were </p><p>waiting with their prisoners. Before </p><p>the patrol wagon appeared, he saw the </p><p>bobbing lanterns of a lurching cab </p><p>that turned a corner a block away. As </p><p>it stopped at the entrance, a police </p><p>officer in plain clothes leaped out and </p><p>helped after him a young man wrap- </p><p>ped in an overcoat, with one arm in a </p><p>sling, pale, and with bandaged head. </p><p>The girl' uttered a cry, and sped </p><p>through the doorway.

Remember, it may be</p><p> used against you.”</p><p> “There is nothing to say," said the</p><p> prisoner, in perfect English, "except</p><p> that 1 killed Corey-”</p><p> “You confess?” yelled the Chief.</p><p> The man shrugged hopelessly</p><p> “Confess!” he echoed, “what else is</p><p> there to do? I suppose you want to</p><p> know why. Well, because Corey</p><p> ruined me financially. lie stole my</p><p> purse; I stole his life. But I’d like to</p><p> know how you picked up the trail.”</p><p> Fenner stepped over to the un-</p><p> fortunate man. "I found it,” he said,</p><p> simply. “Why didn’t you keep that</p><p> clothes line of yours indoors?”</p><p> The man started, paled, then cried</p><p> in anguish, “My God, I never thought</p><p> of that. I could have, couldn’t I?”</p><p> "You could,” agreed Fenner, grimly,</p><p> "and if you had, you never would have</p><p> been caught. Send him over, Chief,</p><p> and I’ll tell you how the trick was</p><p> done.”</p><p> The man departed in charge of the</p><p> two officers and Fenner tore the lid</p><p> off the wooden box which the officers</p><p> had brought. He turned to me. “And</p><p> here, Bill,” he said mockingly, "Is</p><p> your educated harpoon.”</p><p> And he placed before my aston-</p><p> ished eyes an educated harpoon in</p><p> very truth. It was a small airplane,</p><p> wirelessly controlled, and its nose was</p><p> a long, bayonet-like knife.</p><p> “Then the clothes line-”</p><p> "Was his aerial,” cut in Joe, “and</p><p> for the distance over which he wanted</p><p> to work he might just as well have</p><p> kept it inside. Just look this thing</p><p> over carefully, old man. It’s a shame</p><p> that fellow stooped to murder. He</p><p> has ideas worked out here that would</p><p> have retrieved his fallen fortunes.</p><p> Notice that the airplane attachment</p><p> is really two complete planes. I’ve</p><p> been wondering ever since I realized</p><p> how the job was done; how under the</p><p> sun, after the knife was buried in</p><p> Corey’s back, it was gotten out again.</p><p> Now I see. When it came through</p><p> that window, the wings were right in</p><p> back of the knife and the propellers</p><p> in back of the wings with the rudder</p><p> at the rear. Now notice the hinging</p><p> arrangement which folded the wings</p><p> into a rudder and opened the rudder</p><p> out into a set of wings. The whole</p><p> machine was reversed. Even an auxi-</p><p> liary propeller has been provided.</p><p> And the lag of the knife in the wound</p><p> held the whole thing like a brake</p><p> just long enough for the propeller to</p><p> get up speed before it gave and re-</p><p> leased the machine. At that the fel-</p><p> low must have had an anxious minute</p><p> until he got the contrivance out</p><p> through the window again. Only the</p><p> fact that it is a large room allowed</p><p> him to get the machine high enough</p><p> to clear that window sill on its way</p><p> out. The selective control offers noth-</p><p> ing new. The control points are con-</p><p> stantly traversed by a revolving,</p><p> clock-work driven switch, and these</p><p> miniature vari-colored lights were the</p><p> tell-tales that told the distant pilot on</p><p> what contact point' the blade rested</p><p> at any given minute. For instance,</p><p> when the light showed red, the rud-</p><p> der could be swung to the right; when</p><p> on green to the left. He followed its</p><p> course through powerful night glasses.</p><p> Take a look at .the coherer. You never</p><p> saw the like before. I’ll bet it’s a</p><p> peach. And this relay’s weight or</p><p> rather, lack of it, would amaze you.</p><p> But the masterpiece of the whole</p><p> thing is the power plant. He must</p><p> have .worked for months on this model</p><p> gasoline engine. I can imagine that</p><p> for its weight it produces an awful</p><p> power, and it is absolutely silenced.</p><p> “There are at least a dozen new</p><p> ideas involved here, and new applica-</p><p> tions of hundreds of old ones. Under</p><p> the spur of a great emotion—RE-</p><p> VENGE—this man has produced a</p><p> thing of terrible possibilities. You</p><p> have seen what happened to Corey.”</p><p> The Chief and I were gazing in</p><p> awe at the little plane. I appreciated</p><p> the disposition of wing surface which</p><p> cut down the span sufficiently to al-</p><p> low it to pass through a window three</p><p> feet wide. And I realized the patient</p><p> paring away of a fraction of an ounce</p><p> there that brought the total weight of</p><p> the machine low enough to allow of</p><p> the small supporting surface. There</p><p> was not an unessential piece of ma-</p><p> terial to be found on the plane. The</p><p> only thing not needed in the operation</p><p> of the thing was the knife, and even</p><p>OPPORTUNITY </p><p>AD-LETS </p><p> This column will appear monthly</p><p> in AMAZING STORIES.
