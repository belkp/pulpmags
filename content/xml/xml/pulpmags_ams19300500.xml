The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">B story was told that a British ship the "Hussar," carry-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing a quantity of gold coin,_ estimated to be about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">$4,000,000 in value, to pay the British soldiers in America,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in Revolutionary times, had sunk in that locality, and the barge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was supposed to be there to be used in recovering the gold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And this story, in a way, can be repeated of various localities</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the ocean's floor. Ship after ship has been sunk, in numberless</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cases carrying treasure enough to make many men's fortunes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if it could only be salvaged. Thus, if it were possible to get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into the treasure-room of the Lusitania, it is understood there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be a; very large sum of coin to be saved. Ship after</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ship carrying treasure has met this fate and has been sunk in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more or less deep water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now we may go the other way. One of mankind's ambitions,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">often a sporting achievement, if we may use that expression, has</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been the climbing of mountains. One after another, of what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we consider the gigantic eminences on the earth's surface, have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been scaled by Alpine climbers until few of the very highest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">remain unconquered. In the Himalaya range, a height of over,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">five miles above the sea level is reached by some of the peaks,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and they have not all been climbed. And while it is not safe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to make any such assertion, in view of what men accomplish, it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is somewhat doubtful if Mount Everest will ever be ascended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Near one of the West India islands, one of the deepest spots</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the ocean is to be found, going down to about the same</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">- distance that Mount Everest rises.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So mankind, living on the surface of the earth and moving</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about on it, has developed two desires--one to go up far above</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the surface of the earth; another to go down below the surface of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the ocean. If we consider his greatest achievements in these two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lines and determine their general proportional value to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">size of the earth, it will be seen that man can do virtually</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nothing in the departure from the surface level of the earth. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">greatest heights which have ever been attained have been in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">airplanes. As greater and greater heights are reached, the air</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">becomes rarer, and oxygen cylinders or other containers have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to be relied on to supply the necessary oxygen gas. The cold is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very great, so that every one of these record-breaking attempts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">has involved the greatest hardship, danger to life, and is an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">example of the heroic, if we can only figure to ourselves that it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">does any good to humanity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We may take the earth as being about eight thousand miles iu</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">diameter. It will be seen that the greatest altitude attained by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man is six eight-thousandths of the diameter of the sphere on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which we live. The impressiveness of magnitude, it may be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said, lies in proportion; the six miles that we have taken as a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rough approximation of the height'reached by the aviator is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">less than one one-thousandth of the earth's diameter--about three-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quarters of a thousandth. On a fair size globe, say one ten</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inches in diameter, this height, would be represented by about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one-hundredth of an inch, or a little less than that. To get an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">idea of what this is, you may take a book and you will find that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a page, if of reasonably thick paper, is about one two-hundredths</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of an inch thick, so that a couple of pieces of paper pasted one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on top of the other on the globe would represent the great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">achievement of the aviator and the approximate height of Mount.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Everest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This certainly seems to be very little. But when it comes to :</seg><seg type="columnLine">going down into, the earth instead, the best that -man can do</seg><seg type="columnLine">may figuratively be stated to be of microscopic extent. A good</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep level for a diver to attain is one hundred and fifty feet as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the practical view of the maximum which has ever been reached.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Take it in proportion to the diameter of the earth, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes to something like the thirty-thousandth part of the diame-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, so that on our ten-inch globe it would represent a depression</seg><seg type="columnLine">of about the three-thousandth of an inch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The question of the supply of oxygen for the lungs is one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great problems in flying to great altitudes. But, in going</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in the water, the diver has to be supplied with air at high</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure, so that he gets plenty of oxygen. About four-fifths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the air is nitrogen, an absolutely inocuous, harmless gas, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously enough, this is the gas which the diver has to think of;</seg><seg type="columnLine">this is the gas which gives him the divers' disease known as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"bends." As nitrogen is somewhat soluble in water, and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course much more so at high pressure than at low, the effect is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the diver's blood under the high pressure dissolves a quantity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nitrogen, and if brought up rapidly out of pressure, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitrogen, presumably assuming the gaseous form, fills the diver's'</seg><seg type="columnLine">veins with bubbles, and, perhaps it is fair to say, by its me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanical effect, gives the disease called the "bends." The cais-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son,worker, or the deep-sea diver, is protected from this disease</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a gradual release of the pressure. It has even been proposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to supply divers with a mixture of helium gas and oxygen. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">helium gas is supposed to have no effect upon the system on Sc-.</seg><seg type="columnLine">count of its insolubility in water. Often, to cure the "bends."--</seg><seg type="columnLine">an iron cylinder, into which the sufferer is introduced, forms1</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the outfit. In it the pressure is brought up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">original and then very slowly diminished. In this way the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitrogen escapes from the blood and the disease sucGnmBs to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect of the "iron doctor," as the cylinder is termed. Lack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen, one of the constituents of the atmosphere, prevents</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascending; excess of nitrogen, the other principal constituent*,</seg><seg type="columnLine">causes troubje in deep-sea diving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now it is said that Captain Simon Lake, the pioneer in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventor of the submarine^ wishes to attempt the recovery of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous "Hussar."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many of our stories bring in the fourth dimension and man</seg><seg type="columnLine">glories in living in a three dimensional world.

What might have happened to some of the other planets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps so much older than the earth, and what might be found upon them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">might easily exceed the pale of human conception. But that is exactly why</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subject of the possibilities of life 2000 millions of miles away from us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">opens such a fertile field for writers of scientific fiction.

That first news was contained</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a brief message sent out from the North</seg><seg type="columnLine">American Observatory, in upper New York, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed by Dr. Herbert Marlin, the observatory's head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It stated that within the last twenty-four hours a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">increase had been detected in the sun's rotatory speed, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate of spin, and that while that increase might only be</seg><seg type="columnLine">an apparent one, it was being further studied. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief first message was broadcast, a few hours later, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Intelligence Bureau of the World Government, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York. It was I, Walter Hunt, who supervised the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadcasting of that message at the Intelligence Bureau,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I remember that it seemed to me of so little general'</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest that I ordered it sent out on the scientific-news</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave rather than on the general-news wave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Late on the next day, however--the 4th--there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">another report from the North American Observatory in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which Dr. Marlin stated that he and his first assistant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an astronomical student named Randall, had checked</seg><seg type="columnLine">their observations in the intervening hours and had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was in reality a measurable increase in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's rotatory speed, an increase somewhat greater than</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been estimated at first. Dr. Marlin added that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the facilities of the observatory were being utilized in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort to determine the exact amount of that increase,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and although it seemed at first glance rather incompre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hensible, all available data concerning it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered. And at the same hour, almost, there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">corroborative reports from the Paris and Honolulu Ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servatories, stating that Dr. Marlin's first observations</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already been confirmed independently by their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">observers. There could be no doubt, therefore, that .the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun was spinning faster!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To astronomers this news of the sun's increased rota-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory speed became at once a sensation of the first impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance, and in the hours following the broadcasting of Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin's first statement, we at the Intelligence Bureau</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been bombarded with inquiries from the world's</seg><seg type="columnLine">observatories regarding it.

I had exclaimed, when the Intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief had handed to me that first report for broadcast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. "Dr-. Herbert Marlin--why, he was my astronomy</seg><seg type="columnLine">prof up at North American University, two years ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, you know him," the Chief had remarked. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose then that this statement of his on the sun's in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased rate of spin is authentic?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Absolutely, if Dr. Marlin gave it," I told him. "He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the three greatest living astronomers, you know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I became good friends with him at the University, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't seen him for some time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So that it was with an interest rather unusual for me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I followed the reports on this technical astronomical</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation in the next few days. Those reports were</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming fast now from all the observatories of earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Geneva and Everest and Tokio and Mexico City,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for almost all astronomers had turned their interest at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once toward this unprecedented phenomenon of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's increased rate of spin, which Dr. Marlin had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">first to discover. The exact amount of that increase, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered, was still somewhat in doubt. For not only did</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun turn comparatively slowly, but the problem was</seg><seg type="columnLine">complicated by the fact that it did not, like the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">or like any solid body, rotate everywhere at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, but turned faster at the equator than at its poles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to its huge size and the lack of solidity of its mass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Marlin, however, stated that according to his obser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vations the sun's great fiery ball, which had rotated pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viously at its equator at the rate of one rotation each</seg><seg type="columnLine">25 days, had already increased its rate of spin, so as to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning now at the rate of one rotation each 24 days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">12 hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This meant that the sun's rotatory period, or day, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">decreased 12 hours in three earth-days, and such an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">precedented happening was bound to create an uproar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement among astronomers. For to them, as to all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had any conception of the unvarying accuracy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">superhuman perfection of the movements of the sun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its worlds, such a sudden increase of speed was all but</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible. And when on the fourth day Dr. Marlin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a score of other observers reported that the sun's ro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tatory period had decreased by another 4 hours, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement of the astronomers was unprecedented. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">few of them, indeed, sought even in the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recorded observations to cast doubt on the thing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's rotatory speed, they contended, could be measured</seg><seg type="columnLine">only by means of the sun-spots upon its turning surface,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was well known that those sun-spots themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">often-changed position, so that this sudden increase in</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed might only be an illusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This contention, however, found small support in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the indisputable evidence which Dr. Marlin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fellow-astronomers had advanced in the shape of</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous helio-photographs and time-recordings. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun was spinning faster, that was undoubted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater part of the world's astronomers--but what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">making it do so? Was it due to some great dark body</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">passing the solar system in space? Or was it due to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strange changes within the sun's great fiery sphere? It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was the latter theory, on the whole, that was favored by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">most astronomers, and which struck me at the time as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">most plausible. It was generally held that a great shift-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing of the sun's inner layers, a movement of its mighty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">interior mass, had caused this sudden change in speed of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rotation. Dr. Marlin "himself, though, when questioned,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would only state that the increased rate of spin was in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">itself beyond doubt but that no sound theory could as yet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be formed as to the phenomenon's cause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">AND while the astronomers thus pondered and dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">puted over the thing, it had begun to arouse reper-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cussions of interest in the non-scientififc public also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">More and more inquiries concerning it were coming to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">us at the Intelligence Bureau in those first few days,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">those inquiries becoming so numerous as to cause us to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">switch the news on the thing from the scientific-news</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wave to the general-news wave, which reached every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'-.communication-plate in the world. It was, no doubt,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out of sheer lack of other topics of interest that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">world turned thus toward this astronomical sensation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">For sensations of any kind were rare now in this peace-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ful world of ours. The last mighty air war of 1972,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which had ended in the total abolition of all Rational</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">boundaries and the establishment of the World Govern-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment with its headquarters in the new world-capital of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">New York, had brought peace to the world, but it had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">also brought some measure of monotony. So that even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">such a slight break in the order of things as this increase</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the sun's rate of spin, was rather welcomed by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">peoples of the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And now, the thing had passed from the realm of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">merely surprising to that of the astounding. For upon the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fifth and sixth days had come reports from Dr. Marlin</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and from the heads of the other observatories of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">world that the strange phenomenon was still continuing,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the sun's rotatory speed was still increasing. In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">each of those two days, it was stated, it had decreased its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">period of rotation by another 4 hours, the same daily</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">decrease noted previously. And the exactness of this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">decrease daily, the smoothness of this strange accelera-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion of the sun's spin, proved that the acceleration could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not have been caused by interior disturbances, as had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at first been surmised. A great interior disturbance of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sun might indeed cause it to spin suddenly faster, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no such disturbance could be imagined as causing an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">exact and equal increase in its speed of spin with each</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">succeeding day. What, then, could be the cause? Could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it be that in some strange way the universe was suddenly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">running down?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But while Dr. Marlin and his fellow-astronomers dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cussed this matter of the phenomenon's cause, it was its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">effects that had begun to claim the attention of the world</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at large. For that increase of the sun's speed was al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ready making itself felt upon earth. Even the great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">storms in the sun's mass, those storms that we call sun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spots, indeed, make themselves felt upon earth by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">intense electrical and magnetic currents of force which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they throw forth, causing on earth electrical storms and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">auroras and strange weather-changes. And now all the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">usual phenomena were occurring, but enhanced in inten-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sity. On the third day of the thing, the 6th of May,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there occurred over the mid-Atlantic an electrical storm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of such terrific power as to all but sweep from the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">105</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the great air-liners caught in it, the Constantinople-New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York liner and a grain-ship bound from Odessa to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baltimore having been forced down almost to the sea's</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface by the terrific air-currents. Great auroras were</seg><seg type="columnLine">reported farther south than ever before, and over all our</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth changes in temperature were quick and sudden.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And among the other new phenomena called into being,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently by the sun's increased spin, were the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations discovered at that time by Dr. Robert Whitely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a prominent physicist and a colleague of Dr. Marlin's at</seg><seg type="columnLine">North American University.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Whitely's report, though rather obscured in inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est by the central fact of the sun's increased speed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spin, was yet interesting enough to physical students,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if or in it he claimed to have discovered the existence of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new and unknown vibratory force, emanating apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the disturbed sun. This was, he claimed, a vibra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion whose frequency lay in the octaves between light</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Hertzian or radio vibrations, an unexplored territory</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the domain of etheric vibrations. Dr. Whitely him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self had for some time been endeavoring to push his</seg><seg type="columnLine">researches into that particular territory, but though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had striven with many methods, he had been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce or find no etheric vibrations of that frequency</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the strange increase of the sun's rotatory speed had</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun. Then, he stated, his instruments had recorded</seg><seg type="columnLine">new vibrations somewhere out in space toward the sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jvhose frequency lay between the light and Hertzian</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequencies, and which seemed a force-vibration of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort, weak reflections from it only being recorded by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments. It seemed possible, he stated, that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange new force-vibration was being generated some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where inside the disturbed sun itself, and he was study-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it further to determine the truth of this theory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This discovery of Dr. Whitely's, however, interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it was, seemed to be but a side-issue of the real</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem, the acceleration of the sun's rotation. After the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixth day, there were no further reports from Dr. Marlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his fellow-astronomers. During all the seventh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight and ninth days there came no word to the Intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence Bureau regarding it, from any of the astronomers</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had formerly reported to us on it. And though we</seg><seg type="columnLine">got into touch with Dr. Marlin and the others by com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munication-plate, none of them in those three days would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make any statement whatever on the thing, saying only</seg><seg type="columnLine">ithat it was being carefully studied by them and that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement would be issued soon. It was evident from</seg><seg type="columnLine">this universal sudden silence on their part that the as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronomers of the world's observatories were acting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conjunction, but why they should want to withhold from</seg><seg type="columnLine">an interested world the news on this strange acceleration</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun's spin, we could not understand. The great</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical storms and temperature-changes that had pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vailed over earth continued,'and we were anxious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how much longer we might expect them to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One would think that Dr. Marlin and the other as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronomers had some great secret they were keeping from</seg><seg type="columnLine">us," I remarked to-Markham, the Intelligence Chief, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he skook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Secret or not, Hunt, they're doing us out of/the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual news-subject we've had for a year,"* he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why don'f they give us whatever they've learned about</seg><seg type="columnLine">this change in the sun's rate of spin?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a question repeated by more than one in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, for the great public having become interested in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter was irritated by this silence on the part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Marlin and his fellow-scientists. Whatever they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned or guessed as to the thing's cause, why did they</seg><seg type="columnLine">not give their information to the Intelligence Bureau for</seg><seg type="columnLine">distribution to the world ? It was hinted freely that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole matter was a hoax devised by Dr. Marlin, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had duped the astronomical world for the time being, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they were reluctant to acknowledge. It was sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested also that the World President or the World</seg><seg type="columnLine">Congress should take action to make the astronomers</seg><seg type="columnLine">give out their usual reports. The public was quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">working itself into a state of indignation over the matter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when there suddenly burst upon it that doom-laden and</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible statement by Dr. Marlin, which was to loose an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unprecedented terror upon the peoples of earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was on May 13th, the tenth day after Dr. Marlin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">first announcement of the thing, that he gave to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world through the Intelligence Bureau-that epochal state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and in it he referred first to his silence and to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence of his fellow astronomers in the preceding few</seg><seg type="columnLine">days. "In those days," he said, "every observatory in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world has been engaged in an intensive investigation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this acceleration of the sun's rotation, which I discovered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in each of those days the sun's rotatory speed has</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to increase at exactly the same rate! In each</seg><seg type="columnLine">day that speed has increased so much as to cut down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's rotatory period 4 hours more, so that now, ten days</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the beginning of the thing, its rotatory period has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been cut down by 40 hours. In other words, ten days</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago the sun turned as it had always turned to our knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge, at the rate of one turn in every 25 days, at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">equator. Now the sun's rotatory speed has increased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rate of one turn in every 23 days, 8 hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that increase of rotary speed continues.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With each passing day the sun's rate of rotation is grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing greater by the same amount, with each passing day</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is lessening its rotatory period by 4 hours. And that</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady increase of rotation of the sun, if it continues,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spells destruction for the sun as we know it! All know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the sun in rotating generates in its own mass a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain amount of centrifugal force, force which tends</seg><seg type="columnLine">to break up its mass. That force is not large enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, in our own sun to affect its great mass, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">our sun's speed of rotation is not great. We know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">over vast periods of time a sun's rotatory speed will</seg><seg type="columnLine">increase, due to the slow shrinkage of its mass, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the speed has increased to a point where its cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trifugal force is greater than its own power of cohesion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun breaks up like a bursting flywheel, breaks up or</seg><seg type="columnLine">divides into a double or multiple star. Thousands upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">tens of thousands of the stars of our universe are double</seg><seg type="columnLine">or multiple stars, having been formed thus from divid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing single suns, whose speed or rotation became too great.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But as I have said, our own sun seemed in no danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this fate, since the natural increase of a sun's rotatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, due to the shrinkage of its mass, is so unthinkably</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow, requires such unthinkable ages, that it is out of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">concern of ours. For our sun has rotated once in 25</seg><seg type="columnLine">days at its equator, and it has been calculated that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would need to reach a rotatory speed of once in one hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">before its centrifugal force would be great enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">divide it, to break it up. And because of that eon-long</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowness of a star's natural increase of rotatory speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there seemed, indeed, no slightest peril of our own sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividing or breaking up thus, because before it could</seg><seg type="columnLine">106</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">reach that speed of rotation required, unthinkable ages</seg><seg type="columnLine">must elapse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But now, due to some cause, which none of us have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able to guess, some great cause utterly enigmatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unknown to us, our sun's rotatory speed has begun</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly to grow greater, to increase! Faster and faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">every day the sun in spinning, its speed of rotation in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasing by-the same amount each day, its rotatory period</seg><seg type="columnLine">decreasing by exactly 4 hours each day! You see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">that means? It means that if the sun's speed of spin</seg><seg type="columnLine">continues to increase at that steady rate, if its rotatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">period continues to decrease by that amount each day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it shows every sign of doing, within 140 days more</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun's rate of rotation will have increased so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it will be turning at the rate of one turn in one hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have reached that speed at which our calculations</seg><seg type="columnLine">show that its great mass can no longer hold together!</seg><seg type="columnLine">So that 140 days from now, if this increase of rotatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed continues, our sun will infallibly divide into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">double star!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that division means death for earth and almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">all its sistcr-planets! For when the sun divides into two</seg><seg type="columnLine">great new suns, the first force of their division will send</seg><seg type="columnLine">those two mighty balls of fire apart from each other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pushing thus apart from each other, they will in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">evitably engulf in their fiery masses all the inner planets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most of the outer ones!

It cannot be doubted</seg><seg type="columnLine">then that whatever is causing this strange acceleration, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will keep on, until in a mere 137 days from the present,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun's rotatory period will have reached the figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hour.

Those two scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tists are well known to all of you, for they are Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herbert Marlin himself, who first discovered the fact of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun's faster spin, and Dr. Robert Whitely, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">physicist-colleague, who has been studying the new vi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brations recorded by his instruments since the beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that acceleration of the sun's rotatory speed.

Through the great windows there came a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">hum of sound from the sunlit surrounding city, but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big room itself was silence almost complete until</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Marlin's strong, deep voice broke it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It was thirteen days ago," he Said, "that the accelera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of our sun's rotatory speed was first noted, thirteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">days ago that it first began to spin faster. In those days</seg><seg type="columnLine">we of the world's observatories have sought unceasingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the cause, whatever it was, that was behind this</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange acceleration of the sun's spin, and have sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that cause even more intently in the last few days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since it was recognized by us, that this increasing rotatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed foreshadowed the division of the sun and the doom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of almost" all its planets. That acceleration of speed was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too exact, too uniform each day, to be the result'of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior disturbances. It could not be the result of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence of some dark body passing the solar system in</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, for such a body would affect the planets also.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What, then, could be the thing's cause? That is what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all astronomers have been seeking to solve in the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">days. That great enigma has finally been solved, not by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomer, but by a physicist--by Dr. Robert Whitely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my fellow-professor at North American University.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It will be remembered that when the first great effects</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun's increased spin became apparent on earth, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great electrical storms and temperature-changes that still</seg><seg type="columnLine">are troubling earth, Dr. Whitely announced the discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of new vibrations which were apparently emanating</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the troubled sun also. That new vibration lay in</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequency between the Hertzian and the light vibrations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unexplored territory in the field of etheric vibrations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed, Dr. Whitely then stated, a force-vibration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort, the weak reflected impulses from it, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached his instruments, affecting them as tangible force.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed reasonable to suppose, therefore, that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">new force-vibration or ray was being generated inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun's disturbed mass, just as light-vibrations and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat-vibrations and cosmic ray-vibrations and many</seg><seg type="columnLine">others are generated by and radiated from the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"TN the next days, however, Dr. Whitely continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">. A study this new vibration, and endeavored to trace it</seg><seg type="columnLine">accurately to the sun by using recording instruments</seg><seg type="columnLine">which recorded it as strongest or weakest in various</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters of space. By means of these instruments, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was able to plot the course of this force-vibration or ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">in space, to chart the path of its strongest portion in</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. And by doing this he found that this new force</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibration, contrary to his expectations, was not being</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiated out equally in all directions as one might expect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was being shot forth in a great force-beam or ray, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">which cut a straight path across half our solar system!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that mighty force-ray, whose weaker reflected puls-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings only struck his instruments here on earth, was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">being generated and shot forth by the sun, but was strik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the sun! And tracing its path out across the solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">system by his charts he found that the great force-ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being shot out from the planet Neptune, was stab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing across the great gulf from Neptune, the outermost</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, and striking the sun!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And it was that giant force-ray, as Dr. Whitely and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon saw, that was and is making our sun's rotatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed steadily increase! For that great ray, as we found,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is one that can stab across space and strike any object</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with terrific force, as though it were solid and material!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You know that even light rays, light vibrations, exert a</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite pressure or force upon the matter which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike. Well, these force-vibrations, of greater wave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">length than the light vibrations, also exert pressure and</seg><seg type="columnLine">force upon any matter which they strike, but they exert</seg><seg type="columnLine">an infinitely greater pressure, can stab across the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">void and strike any object with colossal and unceasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure. In this way, then, this great force-vibration or</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray hurtles across space and strikes all matter in its path</seg><seg type="columnLine">with terrific force, as though a solid arm were pushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the gulf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And this terrific ray of force, stabbing in through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar system from Neptune, was striking our sun just at</seg><seg type="columnLine">its edge, just at its limb, at its equator. It struck that</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge turning always away from Neptune, and striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">that turning edge of the sun with terrific force as it did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great pushing ray made it turn even faster away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune at that edge, made the sun turn faster and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster! Pressing always upon the turning sun's edge with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same great power, this mighty force-ray has made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun rotate faster each day, has made its rotatory speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">increase by the same amount each day. And since that</seg><seg type="columnLine">great ray is still stabbing across the gulf from Neptune</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sun, is still accelerating the sun's spin, it is to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray that we will owe the division of our sun into two</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts, 137 days from now, and the consequent wrecking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our solar system!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For Neptune alone will escape the cataclysm that</seg><seg type="columnLine">will take place when the sun divides, and it is from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune, from intelligent beings on Neptune, there can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be not the slightest doubt, that this great force-ray comes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For it cannot be doubted for an instant that this mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-ray is the work of intelligent creatures upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune. Never in all the many discussions concerning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the possibility of life on the other planets have astrono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mers conceded any possibility of life on Neptune, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outermost of the sun's worlds, for though we have al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways known it to have air and water, its great distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the sun must needs make it so cold a world as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be unable to sustain life. That was our belief before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but now with this great ray from Neptune swiftly wreck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing our solar system before our very eyes, we can no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer doubt that life, intelligent life, exists there!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is the beings of Neptune, therefore, the creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun's outermost world, who are making the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">spin faster and faster, who are deliberately planning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make our sun divide into a double star, to wreck its uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse! What their reason is for doing this, we cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">now guess. We know that Neptune, almost alone among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun's planets, will survive the great cataclysm of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">division, and we can but hazard the thought that it is for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some great advantage to themselves that the Neptunians</seg><seg type="columnLine">are engaged upon this colossal task.

True, we have managed to send</seg><seg type="columnLine">rockets to our moon and explode flares there by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, but never yet have any of us reached even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest of our neighboring planets. And thus to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose to go out to Neptune, the farthest and outermost of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the planets, the last outpost of our solar system, may</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear to you quite senseless.

He has been able to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vise small generators which produce the same force-ray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on that principle larger generators also can be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vised and constructed, to shoot forth a force-ray of im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense power. With such a force-ray, generated from</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside a strong, hermetically-closed flier, one could shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">out at will into the great void! For if such a flier, resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth, turned its powerful ray down upon earth, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray would strike earth with terrific force. Being so vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mass, and the flier from which the ray is shot down</seg><seg type="columnLine">being so small, it would not be earth that would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceptibly moved by the ray, but the flier itself would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be shot instantly up and outward into space by the ray's</seg><seg type="columnLine">great pushing reaction!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It would be necessary only to head the space-flier</seg><seg type="columnLine">out toward the desired planet upon starting, and the push-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing force of the great ray, constantly turned on, would so</seg><seg type="columnLine">accelerate the flier's speed that it would be pushed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward that planet at a terrific velocity, a speed which</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be controlled by the power of the pushing ray.

And when the space-flier neared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet that was its goal, it could gradually slow its</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress by means of a ray shot ahead toward that</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, braking its forward rush thus, and being able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">land smoothly and without harm upon that planet!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Such a space-flier as that might be built and operated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that way, with the great force-ray or vibration of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings of Neptune to propel it, and in such a flier it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be possible to go out across the gulf to Neptune</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself!

"Three more days," he said, "and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we'll be starting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We four, Marlin and Whitely and Randall and my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, were standing on the flat roof of the great World</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government building, that gigantic cylindrical white</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure that looms two thousand feet into the air at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the new world-capital, New York. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">around us there stretched the colossal panorama of New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York's mighty cylindrical buildings, each rearing sky-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward from its little green park, extending as far away as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eye could reach, many of them rising on great sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porting piers out of the waters of the rivers and bay</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the island. In the late afternoon sunlight above</seg><seg type="columnLine">them there swirled and* seethed great masses of arriving</seg><seg type="columnLine">and departing aircraft, unfolding their helicopter-vanes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from their long hulls as they paused to rise or descend,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seeming to fill the air, while away to the south the great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Singapore-New York liner was slanting smoothly down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">toward the great flat surface of the air-docks. Yet it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was to none of these things, nor to the masses of humans</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that swarmed and crowded in the city's streets far be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">neath us, that we four were giving our attention at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that moment, for we were gazing intently at the great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">object that stood on the roof before us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That object was a great gleaming metal polyhedron</seg><seg type="columnLine">that loomed in a supporting framework beside us like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge ball-like faceted crystal of metal. This great</seg><seg type="columnLine">faceted baH of metal, though, was fully thirty feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter, and here and there in the great, smooth, faceted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane-surfaces of it were set hexagonal windows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear glass, protected by thick raised rims of metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">around them. There were also set in six of the facets six</seg><seg type="columnLine">round openings a foot in diameter, one of these being</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the. faceted ball's top, one in itsvbottom, and four at</seg><seg type="columnLine">equi-distant points around its equator. In one of the flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">facet-sides, also, was a screw-door of a few feet diameter</seg><seg type="columnLine">that now was open, giving a glimpse across a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestibule-chamber inside through a second open screw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">door into the great polyhedron's interior. That interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed crowded with gleaming mechanisms and equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, attached to the inner side of the great metal shell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marlin was contemplating the great thing intently</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we stood there on the roof beside its supporting</seg><seg type="columnLine">framework. "Finished--in three more days," he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated. "Everything's ready for the last generator."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That will be done in two days more," said Randall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside me. "Everything else at the World Government's</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratories has been suspended in order to get these</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators ready for us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They've worked fast to get three of the generators in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flier already," Marlin acknowledged. "Especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">since Whitely here, in directing them, had only his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">first crude models to work on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lucky we are to get'the generators completed and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-flier finished in the month we estimated!" I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed. "If the whole world hadn't centered its energies</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the space-flier's completion we'd never have done it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even so it's been a tremendous task."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had, indeed, been a period of tense and toiling ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tivity for Marlin and Whitely and Randall and me, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time of four weeks that had elapsed since Marlin had</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposed his great plan to the World Congress. In those</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks all our efforts, and all the efforts of the world too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed, had been concentrated upon the building of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that space-flier in which we four, first of all men, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to venture out into the great void, to flash out to Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune in our attempt to halt the great ray that was spinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">our sun ever faster to its destruction and to ours. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">each day of those four weeks the rotatory speed of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun had grown ever greater, its rotatory period decreasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">by an exact four hours each day. The instruments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Whitely, too, showed that the mighty force-ray was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still playing unceasingly from Neptune upon the turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's edge, spinning that sun ever faster. Already the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific pressure of that great ray had lowered the sun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotatory period to 18 days, 4 hours, and in hardly more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a hundred days more, we knew, would have brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun's rotatory period down to that critical figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hour at which it could no longer hold together, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it would divide into a double star and plunge earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">to doom and wreck the solar system.</seg><seg type="columnLine">110</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And with that knowledge, all the world had sought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid in the construction of our space-flier. Dr. Marlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">had directed that construction, aided by his assistant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">young Randall, whom I had met for the first time and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a sunny-haired fun-loving fellow of my own age.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And it had been Dr. Marlin who, after consultation with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world's greatest engineering authorities, had chosen</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the flier the form of a great polyhedron. Such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, it had been found, could resist pressure from</seg><seg type="columnLine">within and. without much better than the spherical form</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been at first suggested, and it was realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this power of resistance would be necessary. For upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">venturing out from earth's gravitation-field into gravi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tationless space, the very interior stresses of such a space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier would tend to explode it unless it was braced against</seg><seg type="columnLine">those stresses. Also the space-flier was to be shot out</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the void and maneuvered in that void by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushing reaction of its own great force-rays against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth or other planets, and though that force would thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtle the flier out at terrific speed, it would also crumple</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flier itself unless it were strong enough to withstand</seg><seg type="columnLine">the force-ray's terrific pressure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH the space-flier's form decided and the plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it drafted, work upon it had begun at once. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the World President's suggestion, it was being set up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great flat roof of the World Government building.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From over all earth had come the world's most brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineers and scientists to aid in its construction, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world lay still beneath the great shadowing wing of fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been cast over it, when the peoples of earth had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned first of the doom that Neptune and its beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">were loosing upon the solar system. So that though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's first wild panic had subsided, it had been re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed by a waxing realization and dread that had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peoples of earth and their representatives offer to us</seg><seg type="columnLine">their help in this plan of ours, which alone held out any</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance, however slender, of escape from the annihila-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that was nearing earth. Laboring ceaselessly day</seg><seg type="columnLine">and night therefore, in picked crews of workers that every</seg><seg type="columnLine">few hours replaced each other, Dr. Marlin and Randall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and myself and our eager workers had swiftly brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great space-.flier's metal shell into being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That great crystal-like shell, at Dr. Marlin's sugges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, had been made double-walled, the space between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two walls being pumped to as complete a vacuum as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible so that vacuum might insulate the flier's in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior from the tremendous differences in temperature</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it would meet in space. For where the sun's heat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiations struck the flier in space it would be warm, hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">even, but those parts in shadow would be subjected to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the absolute zero of empty space. Each of these thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">double walls, in turn, was itself built up of alternate</seg><seg type="columnLine">layers of finest steel and of non-metallic, asbestos-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">insulating material, pressed and welded together by titanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces into a single thickness. And the great faceted wall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sections of the flier, when in place, had been so welded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fused one to the other by the new molccular-diffusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusing process, that the great ball-like faceted flier might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been and was, in fact, a single and seamless poly*</seg><seg type="columnLine">hedron, its strength enormous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In one of the flier's facets was the round screw-door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitting one through a small vestibule-chambered, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then through a second hermetically-sealing door into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier's interior. In that interior, all the flier's mechanisms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and equipment had been attached directly to the inner</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">side of its great crystal-like Ball, with hexagonal windows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made double and of thick unbreakable glass, here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in the walls, between the mechanisms. Just inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of those large windows, at what might be called</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ball-like flier's front, were ranged on a black panel of</seg><seg type="columnLine">several feet in length the space-flier's controls. The most</seg><seg type="columnLine">central of these controls were six gleaming-handled levers</seg><seg type="columnLine">which controlled the flier's great force-rays, shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">theiri forth from any one of the six ray-openings in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, to send the flier hurtling through space by reac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, or to use against asteroids or other objects as a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon. Supported from the wall in front of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">levers was a metal chair that swung on pivots and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliding pneumatic shock-absorbing tubes, a metal strap</seg><seg type="columnLine">across it to hold its occupant in it. And the occupant of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that chair, with the six force-ray controls before him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus controlled the flier's flight through space, and could,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if necessary, use its great rays as weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the left of those controls were the recording dials</seg><seg type="columnLine">and switches of the four great generators. Those four</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming cubical generators themselves were attached to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other side of the flier's hollow interior, along with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marvelously compact and powerful Newson-Canetti</seg><seg type="columnLine">batteries. Operating from those batteries whose power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stores were almost exhaustless, the generators, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned on, would generate the great force-vibrations</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, of a wavelength higher than that of light vibra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, exerted a terrific pressure or force beside which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pressure of light was as nothing. These vibrations</seg><seg type="columnLine">were carried by thick black cables running between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier's double walls to the projecting-mechanisms inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the six ray-openings, and from those openings the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-vibrations were released as great force-rays by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operator of the flier's six controls. These great force-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays, we had found, almost equalled the speed of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself in the velocity with which they shot out from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier's ray-openings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In front of the generators' recording dials and switches</seg><seg type="columnLine">was suspended a metal chair like "that of the control-</seg><seg type="columnLine">operator, while between those two was a third chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">before which, on the control-panel, were ranged the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struments recording the space-flier's conditions of flight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a space-speed indicator, working by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ether-drift, a set of dials that accurately recorded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitational pull of celestial bodies in all directions, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and outside temperature recorders, inside and out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side air-testers, and beside others the controls of a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of the necessary mechanisms attached at different</seg><seg type="columnLine">points inside the hollow faceted ball of the flier. Among</seg><seg type="columnLine">these were the controls of the flier's air-renovator, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatically removed the carbon-dioxide from the flier's</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed air by atomic dissociation and replaced it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen from the compact tanks of compressed liquid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen; the controls of the heating-mechanism, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside its own heating coils was to utilize the heat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun on the flier's side in space; and the control of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooded lights set above the flier's control-panel *and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanisms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the right of the control-operator's chair, too, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a fourth similar chair before which were ranged on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the control-panel a compact but extremely efficient bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery of astronomical instruments. There was a ten-inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">refracting telescope, its lens set directly in the big hexa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gonal window over the control-panel, the tube of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescope, thanks to the new "re-reflecting" principle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being but a score or so of inches in length. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">111</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">also a small but efficient spectroscope similarly mounted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a xnicrometric apparatus for accurate measurements of</seg><seg type="columnLine">celestial objects, and a shielded bolometer for ascertain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the radiated heat of any celestial body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These four metal chairs, suspended there in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long control-panel and with the big hexagonal win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow before and above them, were mounted all upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">special shock-absorbing tubes of pneumatic design which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would enable us to withstand the pressure of our flier's</seg><seg type="columnLine">acceleration upon starting, and the pressure also of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">deceleration upon slowing and stopping. Seated in them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would be able to look forth over the space-flier's</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls into the void before us, and since gravitation</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be lacking in the flier, once out in space, metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">straps across them would hold us in them. Here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there among the mechanisms that lined the ball-like flier's</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior, too, were hand-grips by which we could float</seg><seg type="columnLine">without harm among the mechanisms and equipment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the metal bunks attached at one point to the flier's</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior were provided with metal straps to hold us in</seg><seg type="columnLine">them during sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RANGED among the mechanisms, that lined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier's interior, were the cabinets that held our stores</seg><seg type="columnLine">and special equipment. Among these were ample stores</seg><seg type="columnLine">of food in thermos-cans, kept hot thus and obviating all</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity of cooking, the tanks of compressed water, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the extra liquid-oxygen tanks. Also attached to hooks</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the walls were the four space-walkers that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">constructed for us to enable us to venture outside of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier into airless space, if necessary. These space-walkers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were cylindrical metal structures seven feet or more in</seg><seg type="columnLine">height and three in diameter, tapering at the top to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth dome in which were small vision-windows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each held a small generator of force-vibrations, and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally small air-renovator. There were two hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal jointed arms that extended from the upper part,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on entering the cylinder and closing its base-door</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thrust his own arms inside those hollow metal ones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They ended in great pincer-claws that could be actuated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one's own hands inside, while the space-walker itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">was moved through the void by its generated force-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations being shot out from a small ray-opening in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinder's bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standing inside the hollow, ball-like polyhedron of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier, therefore, its mechanisms and equipment extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about and above and beneath one, attached rigidly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every case to the flier's inner surface. That equipment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">those mechanisms, indeed, had taxed all the powers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great World Government laboratories to provide in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the short time that was ours, but by a miracle of effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been done. And now, as we four gazed up toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great gleaming faceted thing, resting beside us there</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its framework of metal girders, we knew that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained only the last of the four great generators to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be completed, and that in two days more, as Randall had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, that too would be completed and installed and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-flier would be ready for its final tests and for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">start of our great trip. Looking up at the great thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">towering there beside us in the waning afternoon sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, I was struck with a sudden realization of the stu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendousness of the task that we had set ourselves; of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that lay before us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To go out in that from earth to Neptune--to Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune!--it seems impossible," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marlin nodded, his hand on my shoulder. "It seems</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">strange enough," he assented, "but to Neptune in three</seg><seg type="columnLine">more days we're going, Hunt. For no other chance is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there to save earth from the doom marching upon it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But can we save it?" I exclaimed. "Can we four</seg><seg type="columnLine">really hope to contend against beings who, whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">their nature, have power enough to reach across the solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">system and speed our spinning sun on to its doom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ours ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marlin looked gravely at me, and at Whitely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall beside me. "A chance there is--must be," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said solemnly, "even though little time now remains to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. And with that chance--with earth's chance--in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, we must strike out to the last with all our power</seg><seg type="columnLine">for earth!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those words of Marlin, I think, steadied us all in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling rush of activities that was ours during the next,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last, diree days. For in those three days, as the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">generator approached completion and was completed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">installed, we four were ceaselessly busy with the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparations for our start. Whitely, who had designed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was to have complete charge of the space-flier's</seg><seg type="columnLine">great generators, was busy inspecting and testing those</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators. Randall and I were familiarizing ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the flier's controls, for we two were to alternate in</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlling its flight through the void. Marlin, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not only command our little party but would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of the astronomical equipment in it, and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">chart our course out through the trackless gulf, was oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupied beside numberless other tasks in plotting, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the assistance of some of the world's foremost astrono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mers, that course that we must follow now. So that as</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came upon us the last day of June 16th, that day</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon whose night we were to start our momentous</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey, it found us working still upon our last prepara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time that day and night had come, too, it found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the excited expectation of the world keyed up to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">agonized point. For days, indeed, great crowds had</seg><seg type="columnLine">swirled about the base of the huge World Government</seg><seg type="columnLine">building, on whose roof we worked, and, as the last hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached, it seemed that all the world's thoughts, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, were concentrated upon that roof, upon the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming space-flier on it. For all knew that upon that</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier and upon the mission which we four were attempt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in it depended the one chance of escape for earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For steadily, remorselessly, the sun was spinning still</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever faster, the great pushing force-ray from Neptune</seg><seg type="columnLine">still stabbing across the solar system to spin the sun on</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on with greater and greater rotatory speed, until it</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided and doomed earth and its sister-planets. So that</seg><seg type="columnLine">those last days, those last hours, seemed to all the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to ourselves to pass with nerve-tearing slowness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came at last, however, the night of the 16th, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night of our start, with the space-flier complete and ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its framework at last. The last work of Marlin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitely had been to check over the construction-plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fiier, which were to be left behind so that a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet of space-fliers, as the World President had said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be constructed. Were we to return from Neptune</seg><seg type="columnLine">with knowledge of the position and nature of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">doom-ray's source there, that fleet of space-fliers would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be ready to sally out and attempt to bring an end to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great ray. But that knowledge, if we gained it, we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring back ourselves, since there was no method of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munication from our space-flier to earth, the well-known</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Heaviside layer" surrounding earth being impene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">112</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trable to all radio and. communication vibrations and</seg><seg type="columnLine">making such communication impossible. With this last</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparation completed, however, we four stood ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the night of the 16th for the start of our great</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was an hour after midnight that we were to start,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was not until some minutes past midnight that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin and Whitely and Randall and I left our quarters</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the World Government building and ascended to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof. As we emerged upon that roof we stopped in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluntarily. For the great roof itself and all the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounding colossal city of New York were lit now with</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant white suspended lights, and beneath them upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof and in the streets far beneath were masses upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses of waiting men and women. Those upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof were the twelve hundred members of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">World Congress, assembled there to see our start out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the void on our desperate venture. At their center</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a clear, roped-off space on the roof in which there</seg><seg type="columnLine">towered the framework that held our great space-flier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming in the brilliance of the lights about it, and just</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside that clear space stood the World President, a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen officials beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we paused there for that moment, Marlin's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave and intent with purpose, Whitely coolly looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him, and Randall and I endeavoring to conceal the</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement that pounded at our hearts, the whole scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">was imprinted indelibly upon my brain. The crowds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brilliant lights about and beneath us, the great space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier's faceted bulk looming into the darkness, the colos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sal buildings of the great world-capital that stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">away in the darkness in all directions, a great mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining lights among which swirled a packed sea of hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manity gazing up toward our flier--these formed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty panorama about us, but in that moment we turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">our gaze up from them, up toward the great constellations</seg><seg type="columnLine">of summer stars that gleamed in the black skies overhead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Away in the southern skies, not high above the horizon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned the equatorial constellations, Scorpio and Sagit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarius and Capricorn, with the calm white light-globule</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Jupiter moving in Scorpio and the bright red dot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars and yellow spark of Saturn in Capricorn. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was toward Sagittarius that we were gazing, for among</seg><seg type="columnLine">that constellation's stars there shone also Neptune, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible to our unaided eyes but almost seen by us, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed, in that tense moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then we four were moving across the roof toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the looming framework that upheld the space-flier, paus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing inside its dear space to face the World President.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a moment of cosmic drama, that moment in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth and the silent peoples of earth, that had gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in millions there to watch us, were sending forth four of</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves into the trackless void for the first time, send-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them forth with earth's one chance for life in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. The World President, facing us, did not speak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though*; did not break the thick silence that seemed to lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">over all the mighty city. He reached forth, gripped our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands with his own, grasped them tightly, silently, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady eyes upon ours, and then stepped back. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin leading, we were clambering up the framework</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the flier's screw-door, passing silently inside and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">screwing that great door hermetically shut behind us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That done, we passed across the little vestibule-chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">and through the second screw-door, closing it likewise</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, clambering up to the four suspended chairs in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the control-panels, we took our places in them;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin in the right chair, his telescope and astronomical</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment before him, I in the next one, with the six</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls of the space-flier's movements before me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall in!the third chair, the recording dials and minor</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls of the flier before him, and Whitely in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth or left chair, the dials and switches of the gener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ators before him. Seated there, the constellation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sagittarius and the other southern stars were full before</seg><seg type="columnLine">us in our big window, for our space-flier was so sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported in its framework that by turning on its great</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-ray from the lower ray-opening we would be shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">out by the terrific repulsive force straight toward Sagit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarius, toward Neptune, slanting out tangent-wise from</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's surface. And now Marlin was peering through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the short, strange-looking tube of the telescope, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching its focusing wheels lightly, peering again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then turning to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Neptune," he said quietly. "We'll start when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaches the center of this telescope's field of view--when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flier is pointed directly toward it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we can maneuver the flier in any direction in</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, could head out from earth and then toward Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune," Randall commented, as I applied my own eye to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telescope, and Marlin nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can, but by starting straight toward Neptune</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll use less of our generators' power."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While he spoke I was gazing through the telescope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and though I had gazed upon Neptune many times before</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was never with such feelings as gripped me now. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little pale green spot of calm light it was, floating there</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the darkness of the great void, its single moon not</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible to me even through the powerful telescope. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I straightened from the telescope's eye-piece Marlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken it again, gazing intently into it now, to call</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to me the moment when the planet reached the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its field of view, when our space-flier would be headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight toward it. For it was then, as Marlin had said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we planned to hurtle out toward the planet with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power of our great force-rays, not only reacting but</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushing against earth as light pushes. But since we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessarily change our course once in space, to allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Neptune's own movement among other things, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would use less power by making our first start straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, as we sat tensely there, I had turned, nodded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitely, and he had thrown open the switches before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that controlled the great generators, their throbbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly sounding behind us as they went into operation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">generating the force-vibrations that in a moment would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be released backward from our flier as mighty force-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays. As Whitely moved the switches, the throb of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators died to a thin hum, then rose to a tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">drone, and then slowly sank to a smooth throbbing beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">at which he rested the switches. And now Marlin, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side me, was calling' out to us the divisions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">specially-designed telescope's field, as Neptune passetl</seg><seg type="columnLine">across them to the zero mark at which we would hurtle</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">• "--45--40--35--30--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As his steady voice sounded periodically beside me I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat as though a poised statue, my hand upon that lever</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the six lever-switches before me that would send</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power of our throbbing generators stabbing out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal force from the flier's ray-opening behind us, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">113</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would send that flier hurtling outward. "--25--20--</seg><seg type="columnLine">IS--As the calm voice of Marlin broke the silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside me I felt my heart racing with excitement, saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Randall, and even Whitely, beside me, had hunched</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely forward as the moment approached. I glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a moment through the flier's windows, seeing in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurred impression the breathless, watching crowds, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant lights. "--10--5--zero l" And as that last</seg><seg type="columnLine">word sounded I threw open in one swift motion the lever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch in my grasp!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The next instant there was a colossal roaring about us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we seemed pressed down in our chairs with titanic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushing force, and saw crowds and lights and great</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings vanishing from about our flier with lightning-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like swiftness as a great pale ray of light, of colossal</seg><seg type="columnLine">force, stabbed down and backward from the flier's ray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening behind us!. In a split-second all about us was</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness and then the great roaring sound about us had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased, marking our passage out past the limits of earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere! Now through the windows before and</seg><seg type="columnLine">about us, as we clung there, we saw the heavens around</seg><seg type="columnLine">us brilliant with the fierce light of undimmed hosts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars, while as our great flier reeled on at mounting speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the great gulf, we saw behind and beneath us a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray cloudy ball that was each moment contracting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">size. Earth was receding and diminishing behind us as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we flashed out through the void toward distant Neptune,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to save that earth from doom!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through Planetary Perils</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">" IT ARS ahead and to the left--we ought to pass</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> |%/fl it in three more hours!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> X T A At my words Marlin nodded. "We won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">Be bothered much by the pull of Mars," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We sat again in our chairs before the control-panel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitely to my left, gazing through the big window be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore us. Ahead and above and all around us there</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched a great panorama, stunning in its brilliance, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">.vast panorama of the starry heavens as seen from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">airless interplanetary void. Blazing in their true bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant colors on all sides of us, the hosts of stars were like</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewels of light set in the black firmament. And as our</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier throbbed on through the great gulf of empty space</seg><seg type="columnLine">at terrific speed, its acceleration still pressing us down</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat in our chairs, we could see now amid the flam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing stars dead ahead the far green spot of light that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune, our goal, visible now to our unaided eyes in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearness of empty space. Nearer toward us and to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right Jupiter was like a brilliant little disk of white light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, the four white points of its greater moons visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. To the left, too, yellow Saturn shone, much</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighter, while nearer toward us on the left, almost be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side us, hung the dull-red little shield, white-capped at</seg><seg type="columnLine">its poles, that was Mars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Behind us, by this time, earth had dwindled to a steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot of bluish light that was like a tiny moon, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller spot that was earth's moon gleaming near it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardly visible as earth was in the blinding glare of the*</seg><seg type="columnLine">great sun that beat upon us from behind, its great corona</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mighty prominences appalling in their splendor, yet it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was visible enough to show how far from it out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">void our flier had already flashed. For forty-eight hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, our great space-flier had rushed outward at a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">speed that had already reached over a million miles an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, and that was steadily mounting still beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific reaction of our great force-ray, that great pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray only visible at its ray-opening source, that was stab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing back with colossal power and by the reaction of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">push sending us hurtling on at greater and greater speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Out and out we had flashed, Randall and I relieving each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other every four hours at the controls, and already now</seg><seg type="columnLine">had almost reached the orbit of Mars, more than fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">million miles outward. Now, as Marlin and Whitely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gazed out toward it, the red disk of Mars itself was but</seg><seg type="columnLine">several million miles from us, to the left and ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gazing toward it, we could see clearly the great ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">caps of the poles of Mars, brilliant white upon its dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">red sphere, and could see clearly also the long straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">markings upon it, a network of inter-connecting lines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that for long had been the subject of discussion and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">putation among earth's astronomers. It was with fasci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated eyes that we gazed toward the red planet as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew nearer to it, and now Randall had joined us, mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with great efforts against the acceleration-pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside the flier. Marlin, though, had turned the telescope</seg><seg type="columnLine">by that time toward the crimson planet, was gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">intently toward it. Minutes he gazed before he straight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened, shaking his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There can be no doubt that those canals--those lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">--are the work of intelligent creatures," he said. "I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">great geometrical forms that seemed structures of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort, but our space-flier is moving at such tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed that it's all but impossible to get a clear focus on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet in the telescope."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We stared toward the red disk and its dark markings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If we could but stop there--who knows what wonders</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars may hold, what science--," 'Whitely mused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marlin nodded thoughtfully. "Neptune's our goal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we can't stop for Mars now, whatever may be there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But if we succeed in our great task, if earth is saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this doom that Neptune's beings are loosing on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar system, we'll come yet to Mars--and to all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">othe'rs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the meantime," I told them, "Mars is pulling our</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier out of its course more and more. I thought our</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed would take us by it, but it seems we'll have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">use another ray."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For even as we had gazed toward the red planet, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had noted from the dials before Randall that the gravita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional pull of Mars upon our space-flier from the left was</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming more and more powerful as we approached it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pass it, and that it was pulling us slowly toward it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of our course toward Neptune. Our deviation to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left was not great as yet, but even the slightest deviation</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could not permit, since not only must we head as</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight toward Neptune as possible to save time, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was necessary that we avoid also the colossal force-ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was stabbing from Neptune across the solar system</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the sun's edge, which was turning that sun ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster. That great force-ray, invisible to us, but lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to our left, we knew", would mean death for us if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we blundered into it, would drive our flier with titantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">force and speed straight into the sun!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So that now, as our space-flier moved nearer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer toward the distant red -shield of Mars, pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther and farther out of its path toward Neptune, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly manipulated the ray-direction dials on the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol-panel, then grasped and threw open another of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">six ray-opening switches. At once there leaped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">114</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">our racing flier's side, from one of its ray-openings there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second great force-ray like that which stabbed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier's rear toward earth. This second ray, though,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguely visible like the first at its source, but fading into</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisibility in space, shot out toward the red sphere of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars, away to our left. And in a moment more, as that</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-swift ray reached Mars and pressed against the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet with all its force, our flier was being pushed away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it, was being pushed back to the right, back into its</seg><seg type="columnLine">original line of flight! Thus we hurtled on, the great rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray of the flier pushing back with terrific force and send-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing us hurtling on through space, while the side-ray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking Mars with lesser force, was sufficient to keep us</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the red planet's grip as we flashed onward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within a few hours more Mars was behind us, its red</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere fading rapidly into a crimson spot of light to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left and behind. The planet's two tiny moons, Phobos</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Deimos, we had not yet seen despite our nearness to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, but it was with something of regret that we saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimson world and all the strange mysteries that we felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">existed upon it, dropping behind us. Neptune alone, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin had said, was our goal, and on toward its calm</seg><seg type="columnLine">green light-dot we were rushing. I turned off our side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray, therefore, which was no longer needed to counter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">act Mars's pull, and we gave all our attention to the pano-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rama ahead. Save for Neptune's distant green dot, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only planets now visible amid the brilliant hosts of stars</seg><seg type="columnLine">before us were Jupiter and Saturn. Saturn was shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever more brightly to the left, its strange ring-formation</seg><seg type="columnLine">already becoming visible to our eyes. But it was Jupiter</seg><seg type="columnLine">that now dominated all the scene before us, his mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere, its oblateness plainly visible, moving in majestic</seg><seg type="columnLine">white splendor at the center of his four great moons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not the planets ahead that held my attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, though, as our throbbing flier raced onward, Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its orbit dropping behind. "The asteroids!" I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed. "We're almost into their region now--will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them soon!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And they're one of the greatest perils we'll en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter," Marlin said. "Hold ready to the controls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hunt, for if we crash into one it means our end--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of earth's chance!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I DID not need his admonition, though, to make me</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense my hands upon the control-switches, gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">intently forward. I knew we were now passing into one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the most dangerous regions of all the solar system--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that great belt of whirling asteroids that lies between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. More than a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">in number, ranging from the great sphere of Ceres,*480</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles in diameter, down to the smallest asteroids of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few miles diameter only, they whirled there around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun between the four inner and four outer planets, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbits a maze of interwoven circles and ellipses. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater part of them were so small, indeed, that at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous speed with which our space-flier was flash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on they could be seen only in the moment that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed upon them. And yet in that moment we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirl aside from any before us, since otherwise, pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer by the asteroid's own gravitational power, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would infallibly crash into it and meet our doom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steadily, therefore, we watched now, as hour followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, as our flier rushed on with speed still slowly mount-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, traveling finally at more than two million miles an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour. The throb of its four great generators was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady as ever, and the pressure of its decreasing acceler-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ation still weighed upon us, but already we had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed to that pressure. So now while I gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth with Marlin-ahead, Randall was at one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right windows and Whitely at one of the left, keeping a</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar watch. And it was Randall, a few hours later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who sighted the first of the asteroids. He uttered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift exclamation, pointing to the right and ahead, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we looked there we saw a small bright point in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness of space, a point that with the swiftness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning was expanding into a great, dull-gleaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere, rushing toward us and drawing our space-flier</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward itself! A moment we saw it rushing thus toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, a great sphere of barren, jagged rock, airless and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waterless, turning slowly in space; and then it was loom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing gigantic just beside us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In that moment, though, my hand had jerked open</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one of the six levers before me, and instantaneously had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shot from our flier's side a great force-ray toward that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">looming asteroid beside us. The next instant the aster-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">oid's giant rock sphere seemed to flash away from us and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">disappear with immense speed, but in reality it was our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flier that had been pushed away from the asteroid .with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">colossal force by the force-ray I had shot toward it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Instantly I snapped off that ray, the space-flier flashing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on in its straight course as formerly. And as I did so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Marlin turned for a moment from his watch at the win-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dow toward me, gestured to the right toward the asteroid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from which we had. so narrowly escaped. In the moment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we had seen it, I had estimated that one to be a hundred</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">miles or more in diameter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That would be Vesta," he said, "one of the largest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It's the only one of that size in this part of their region</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Large or small, I want to see no more of them that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">close," I said.

Not as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">great in size as the first one, but it was approaching us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with terrific speed, and even as I jerked open one of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">switches before me, sent a force-ray stabbing from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flier toward the rushing asteroid, it seemed that that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">asteroid was touching us, its great rocky surface shutting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out all the firmament as it towered there beside us! My</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ray, though, had been shot forth just in time, had whirled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">us aside from the onrushing monster's path at the last</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moment, and as we reeled on, it too had vanished behind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">us. But now I had glimpsed two larger ones ahead and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the left, and was jerking the flier away from them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Still we were racing onward, our great space-flier</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hurtling on and on through that asteroid-filled region, es-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">caping those great rushing spheres of death, sometimes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by the narrowest of margins. Hour upon hour, keeping</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">our sleepless watch at the flier's windows, we flashed on,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">its colossal speed still mounting as more and more of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">our generators' power was turned into the great rear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">force-ray that pressed back towards earth and that shot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">' us outward. By that time earth had become but a bright</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">white star behind us, the sun's size and brilliance de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">creased by a third or more already. But it was not back-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ward we were gazing; it was ahead. We were striving</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with all our powers to avoid the asteroids that hurtled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about us.

On we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">raced, veering now to this side and now to that, with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jupiter looming ever greater ahead and to the right as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we approached the end of the asteroidal belt. But it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as we approached its end, at last, that our greatest peril</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came suddenly upon us. For I had shot the space-flier</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sidewise with terrific speed to avoid an onrushing small</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">asteroid, and the next moment when it slowed its side-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wise rush, found that I had unwittingly shot it into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the very heart of a great family of full two-score of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little planets!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All about us in that moment it seemed WS're asteroids,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming spheres at the very center of whose swarm</seg><seg type="columnLine">our flier flashed, and into which by some miracle our</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewise rush had projected us, unharmed! I heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarse cries of Marlin and Randall beside me, in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, the shout of Whitely, and knew that only an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other miracle could ever take us out of that swarm un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmed. Already, in that split-second, three of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were looming great to our right, another one ahead and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left, and to escape one was to crash upon another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no time for thought, no time for aught save a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning-like decision, and in that fractional instant I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made that decision, and as our flier hurtled through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great swarm of asteroids, had shot out its great force-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays to right and left and above and beneath us, driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in all directions from our flier as it flashed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great swarm!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was an instant in which the space-flier seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be jerking and flashing in wild aimless flight amid that</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarm, as its striking force-rays pushed it now to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and now to another, away from the asteroids about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. Were two of those rays to strike asteroids in oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">site directions, balancing each other, the space-flier, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of being pushed aside, would be crumpled to instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">annihilation between the push of the two great rays, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, and we expected nothing but annihilation in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad moment as we shot on. But after reeling to right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left with dizzy speed for a crazy instant, the aster-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oids of the swarm had vanished suddenly from about us</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we shot out of that swarm! We had escaped, had es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caped a death that for the moment had seemed certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all of us, and that I had managed to evade by instinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">and luck rather than by reason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Close enough--that!" I exclaimed as we raced for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward through the void on our straight course once more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If we meet many more swarms like that, our chances</seg><seg type="columnLine">of getting to Nepture are small!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marlin shook his head. "We seemed gone that time,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he admitted. "But I think we're almost out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">asteroidal region now--we should be crossing Jupiter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbit in another twenty-four hours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The space-flier's doing four million miles an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">now," I said, glancing over at the space-speed dial.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We're beginning to feel Jupiter's pull a little already."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We were, indeed, already deviating a little to the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">from our straight course in answer to the gravitational</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull of the tremendous mass of Jupiter, looming ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater now ahead and to the right. We were to pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">it by some fifteen million miles, more than twice the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance at which we had passed Mars, but the colossal</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, larger than all the other planets of the sun to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, was already attracting us strongly despite our</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific speed and momentum. For the time being,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, we gave it but scant attention, concentrating our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">attention, as we did, upon the watch for farther asteroids,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since we had not yet emerged from-their great belt be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Sleepy and weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we were from our hours upon the watch, we dared not</seg><seg type="columnLine">relax from that watch, and so Whitely and Marlin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall still kept up their constant survey of the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounding void, while I held the flashing space-flier's con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trols, turning more and more of our generators' power</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the great force-ray that was hurtling us on. We had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not dared to use the generators' power too swiftly upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">our start, lest the too great acceleration kill us, despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">our shock-absorbing apparatus. But steadily our speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">already colossal, was mounting, and we were racing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the gulf toward the distant green spot of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was Neptune.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">/"AN and on in those hours we shot, until it seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">V./ me, seated there at the controls, that always we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had flashed thus through endless realms of tenantless</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. For now but a few asteroids were sighted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">our watching' eyes, and the eventlessness and strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">tension of our rush onward through space made it seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a strange flight in some unending dream. On and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, with Marlin and Randall and Whitely watching cease-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly about me, on with the throbbing of our generators</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating in my ears in unhalting rhythm. Behind us</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's bright white star was steadily growing smaller,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but still our great force-ray, stabbing ceaselessly back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from our flier with colossal power, was sending us racing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on faster and faster with its huge reacting force. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">our start from earth, days, hours, before, the great mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion upon which we were speeding outward to Neptune,</seg><seg type="columnLine">these things I had forgotten, almost, as the dream-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality of our onward flight gripped me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as we raced still onward, as Jupiter's mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere loomed greater and greater to the right ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, my bemused faculties were shaken into wakefulness</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the necessities of our situation. By that time we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed out of the dangerous asteroidal region, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their watch no longer necessary Whitely and Randall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after preparing for us all a quick hot meal from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thermos-cans in which all our food supplies were packed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken to their bunks for some much-needed sleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin sat beside me as we rushed on, his astronomical</seg><seg type="columnLine">preoccupation holding him to a contemplation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great planet, despite his own weariness. And weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough he was, and I too, since for almost forty-eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours we had been flashing through the perils of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">asteroidal belt. It was now the beginning of the fifth day</seg><seg type="columnLine">since our start from earth, and already for a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours we had been flashing at tremendous and mounting</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed through the airless void. Like Marlin, though, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot my weariness in the spectacle of giant Jupiter, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right and ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For it was a spectacle of magnificence, indeed. Swing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing like a giant disk of soft white light in the blackness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of space to our right, Jupiter spun amid its four greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">moons, the smaller moons being of diameter too small to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen with unaided eyes even thus close. But of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant sphere of Jupiter, of that great sphere's surface,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing was to be seen. For all the mighty planet's sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was covered by the colossal masses of great clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">that enclosed it, floating in its dense atHiosphere and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling it in great belts, the mighty cloud-belts that for</seg><seg type="columnLine">long have been to astronomers the most characteristic</seg><seg type="columnLine">feature of Jupiter's surface.

At sight of it,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Marlin had prepared and trained his spectroscope</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon it, but after observations of a few moments he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">raised his head, perplexed. He glanced about him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for a moment, then seized the bolometer, which by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">virtue of its new "shielded" principle was able to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">record accurately the amount of heat radiating from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">any one point of a planet of star, as well as from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whqle planet or star. But upon checking its reading</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for a moment, after turning it toward the pink area</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the great red spot, Marlin straightened from it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">also, shaking his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">117</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It's strange, Hunt," he said, turning toward me. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">always been believed that the great red spot is .a part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jupiter's surface still molten and flaming, but the spectro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope and bolometer show that it can't be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Strange enough," I admitted, gazing myself toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">that glowing pink area on the mighty planet.

Hours before I had shot a force-ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the great planet from our flier's side, to counter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">act'its growing pull upon us, but now as we came level</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it, were passing it, that pull upon us was so enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous that it was only with a force-ray of immense power</seg><seg type="columnLine">that' I was managing to keep the space-flier from being</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn inward. Passing thus close, Jupiter's stupendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud-belted sphere was an awe-inspiring sight, whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">at immense speed also, since the great planet, more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand times greater than earth, rotates upon its</seg><seg type="columnLine">axis at hardly more than a third of earth's rotatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">period or day, its day being less than ten hours. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing it thus, too, the great red spot upon its lower half</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an even greater enigma, for that gigantic pink oval</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, we knew, fully thirty thousand miles in length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater by far than all our earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It-\vas with awe that Marlin and I, and Whitely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall who had awakened now to relieve us, stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the gigantic monarch of the sun's planets as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped slowly behind on our right. A side-ray of colos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sal power it had taken, indeed, to hold us out from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gffcat world's pull, and only slowly could we decrease</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ray's power as we moved farther out from it. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">now at well over four million miles an hour, we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing out beyond Jupiter's orbit, and ahead there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming brighter to the left the yellow spot of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was Saturn, the last planet that we must yet pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">before reaching Neptune, since Uranus was in conjunc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in regard to Neptune, being far on the other side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solar system from us. And as Randall now took my</seg><seg type="columnLine">place at the controls, I pointed toward the little yellow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing, ring-circled disk of Saturn ahead and to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep the flier heading straight toward Neptune,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall," I told him.

"I'll try to keep her straight," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinning, "though I'm beginning to wish that, if there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be trouble, it had come back on Mars or Jupiter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I smiled a little as I swung back from the control-panel</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the flier's inside wall. I went from handhold to</seg><seg type="columnLine">handhold with the pressure of its acceleration still upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, until I had thrown myself into my metal bunk to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall almost instantly asleep, and to dream nightmare</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams of rushing on through endless space toward a</seg><seg type="columnLine">goal that ever receded from us. And in the hours that</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed, in the next three days that our space-flier shot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-	on -and on with Saturn growing ever- greater ahead, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightmare quality of my experience-persisted. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible, at times,, that we four were in reality doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that which men had never done before; that we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">flinging ourselves out into the great, void, out through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar system toward the planet that was its last outpost.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were watching and eating and sleeping, indeed, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in a dream, so strange and utterly unreal seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us this unending rush through unending space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT though we slept, and ate, and watched at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">control-panel like men in a dream, there were times</seg><seg type="columnLine">in those hours when realization of our position, of oitr</seg><seg type="columnLine">great mission, came sharply hopie to us. Those were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">times that Marlin trained his'instruments upon the-sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had by then dwindled to a tiny blazing disk behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. And with those instruments Marlin found that the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still .spinning ever faster and .faster, its rotator pe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riod decreasing still by the same amount each day, its day</seg><seg type="columnLine">of division and doom steadily approaching. And with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own recorders Whitely found that the colossal force-ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Neptune still was stabbing toward the syn, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning it faster and faster toward its doom and that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its universe. That great force-ray, we found, was stab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing toward the sun on a line between our flier's course</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Saturn, but was on a somewhat higher level, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in reality the great ray did not lie between our flier and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saturn but above both.	.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The consciousness we had of that great ray's existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the knowledge we had of the doom it was loosing</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the peoples of our world served to prevent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream-like lassitude of our conditions from overpower-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing us, and we were further awakened by- the' swift ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pansion of Saturn, ahead, as our flier neared it. For by</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the great faceted ball of our flier was hurtling on</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the void at five million miles' an,, hour, slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching the limits of its speed as our mighty rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-ray drove us forward with tremendous power.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And at that speed, in the next three days, Saturn loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger and larger ahead, until we saw at last that upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fourth day's beginning we would pa;ss the mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet. And at that our interest rose to excitement, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause we would pass closer by Saturn than any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets in our straight flight out to Neptune, passing it</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed by no more than \ a million miles. So that as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last hours of those three days passed, we observed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big, yellow-glowing disk of Saturn ahead with intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And a strange sight indeed was great Saturn as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed greater before us and to the left, for strangest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the suns planets to the eye is this one.

"It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is well for us that Saturn is not our goal," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Those titanic meteoric masses that are the rings--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">blunder into them would mean instant annihilation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whitely nodded. "As it is," he said, "there must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">many meteors in this region about Saturn--many that</seg><seg type="columnLine">have broken loose from the rings or are flying toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">those rings."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's hope that you're wrong on that, at least," I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "We'll soon be passing within a million miles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those rings, and I want to meet no meteorites--not after</seg><seg type="columnLine">our experience with the asteroids."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">By then, indeed, we had drawn almost level with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saturn, its huge sphere and colossal rings almost directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the left, the edge of those rings, but a half hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles or less in thickness, being a scant million miles or</seg><seg type="columnLine">more from our racing space-flier. The great maze of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet's nine greater moons seemed crowded now upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">its other side from us, Titan, largest of those moons</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining brilliantly as a small white disk near the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow bulk of Saturn and its colossal rings. Before then</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, I had been forced to shoot out from the flier's side</seg><seg type="columnLine">a force-ray toward Saturn, to counteract the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet's pull upon us, but though if loomed beside us now</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost as immense as great Jupiter itself', its recorded</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull upon us was many times less. This was due, I knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the comparatively small mass of Saturn, since though</seg><seg type="columnLine">of immense size and possessing a vast atmosphere, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to be the least dense of all the planets, being of</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than 0.7 the density of water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> .Even so, however, it was requiring a force-ray of</seg><seg type="columnLine">great power to hold our rushing flier out from the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet. Though lesser than Jupiter's, its pull upon us</seg><seg type="columnLine">was great, nevertheless. And now that we were passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huge world so closely, it seemed to us with its vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">rings and great family of whirling moons to be of uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse-size itself, so mighty did it loom beside us. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">great rings, of small thickness compared to their huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">width and circle, were edge-on to us now, a million miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the left, and we could see that they were in reality but</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast swarms of countless meteors, great and small, whirl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at great speed about Saturn and forming by their divi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion three rings, the innermost a darker one. Yet despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">their strange appearance and colossal size, it was not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great rings that held our interest so much in that moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the cloud-hidden surface of Saturn itself. For even</seg><seg type="columnLine">as in passing Mars and Jupiter, we were gripped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire to veer in toward the planet and explore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange wonders that might exist upon it, or upon its</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater moons. But none suggested that thought now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All four of us knew that only the growing green spot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, that was distant Neptune ahead, must be our goal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS the flier raced on, almost passing the huge planet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•	now, Randall uttered a swift exclamation,.pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead and to the left a little. At the same moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, I had seen the thing that had caught his eye--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small dark point growing with lightning swiftness as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed toward us; a great dark meteor, perhaps five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet in diameter, rushing toward our flier, whirl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing far out from .Saturn's rings in the same direction as</seg><seg type="columnLine">those rings! Instantly, upon seeing it, I had turned more</seg><seg type="columnLine">power into the ray that held us out from Saturn, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were pushed sidewise in the next moment by that in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased power, the big meteor had flashed past us far to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the left! And a moment later, I had caught sight of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar meteors, one smaller than the other, rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward us in the same direction from ahead. But these</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had seen soon enough to avoid collision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was evident that, as Whitely had suggested, we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">encountering some of the stray meteors that might be ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected to whirl here far out from the meteor-swarms 4o.f</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great rings. And as we watched tensely now for</seg><seg type="columnLine">more meteors, it was with something of awe that we.</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed toward the huge rings, that we knew to be rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarms of countless similar jmeteors. It was well, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin had said, that we were not called upon to pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trate through or- around those great rings, since in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful whirling swarms of meteors no craft would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to live even for a moment. But our space-flier was</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing the midmost point of those rings; already huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saturn was beginning to drop a little behind us; and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed more freely. And, ironically enough, it was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that very moment of our relief that catastrophe came</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us. There was a wild shout from. Marlin, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">simultaneously I saw a huge round dark mass looming</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead ahead and whirling toward us. Just as I snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the control-levers, that great dark meteor's mass-had</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck our onrushing flier with a tremendous stunning</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an instant, as the flier reeled and spun there crazily</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the gulf'of space, it seemed the end to me, but in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment more I realized that the great faceted walls had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been penetrated, for the air in the flier was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed. Had those walls been pierced, the result would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been the instant freezing to death of all of us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But that death had not as yet come upon us, and as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled forward in my chair I saw that the space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier was still whirling crazily around from the shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the throbbing of its great generators had ceased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beside me Marlin and Whitely and Randall were com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing back to realization of their surroundings after that</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal shock, Whitely bearing a nasty cut upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple. And as Marlin sprang to the flier's side-window,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed obliquely from it, he uttered an exclamation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That meteor just grazed us!" he exclaimed. "If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't jerked the controls over at the last moment, Hunt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would have hit us head-on! As it is, it smashed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flier's outer wall, but didn't pierce the inner wall w</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the generators!" cried Whitely, who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumbling at their switches. "They've stopped! When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meteor crashed through the outer wall it must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken some of our generator-coniiections between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two walls!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the flier's falling!" I cried in turn. "It's falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Saturn now, with its force-rays dead--we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling into the great rings!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For as I glanced outward I had seen that was what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was happening. The halting of the generators by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking of their connections between the flier's double</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls had halted also the force-rays that had been push-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing us out toward Neptune and that bad-been holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">us out from Saturn's pull. With the halting of those fays</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pull of the mighty planet had at once gripped our</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-flier and now we were moving at swiftly-accelerat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing speed toward that planet's mighty bulk, toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great rings but a million miles to our left! Were falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">helplessly, faster and faster each moment, toward those</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty rings, toward their vast swarms of whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteors in which our space-flier and all within it could</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet only an annihilating death!</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS	' 119</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the Solar System's Edge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"UT of the flier!" Marlin cried to us. "Our one</seg><seg type="columnLine">I 1 chance is to get out and repair those broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">connections from the outside."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how-" Randall began, when the astronomer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">broke in on him. "The space-walkers! In them we can.</seg><seg type="columnLine">get outside, can try to repair those connections before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall into the great rings !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment we stared toward him in sheer surprise, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then as one we were leaping toward the four big space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walkers, suspended from the flier's wall. For though we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not dreamed, in taking them with us, of any such</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergency as now confronted us, we saw that, even as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin had said, our one chance to escape the annihila-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that soon would be ours otherwise lay in their use.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swiftly, therefore, we unhooked the great cylindrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-walkers, neither they nor aught else in the flier</seg><seg type="columnLine">having any but small weight now, that weight being</seg><seg type="columnLine">the result of the pull of great Saturn, toward which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were falling. Quickly swinging open the section near,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinder's base that was its door, therefore, I pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself up into the cylinder, then closed its hermetically-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sealing door with the small inside lever provided for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was standing, therefore, in a metal cylinder seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in height and three in diameter, its top tapering</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a rounded little dome in which were small windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which I could look outward. My arms I had thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the great hollow jointed arms of metal that projected</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the cylinder's sides, and had at my fingers' ends</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside those arms the controls of the great pincer-hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which those arms ended outside, and the control also</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the small generator inside the cylinder whose little</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-ray was shot down from the cylinder's bottom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This could be shot straight down, sending the space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walker upward by pushing against some larger body*</seg><seg type="columnLine">or could be shot out obliquely sending the space-walker</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizontally in any direction. Once inside the space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walker therefore, with its tiny generator throbbing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the equally small air-renovator and heater functioning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was ready to venture out into the airless void.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Glancing out through the vision-windows I saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin and Whitely and Randall had struggled into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-walkers also, and were signalling their readiness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We grasped therefore the tools and materials we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily assembled for our task, these being spare plates</seg><seg type="columnLine">to repair the flier's outer wall and a small molecular-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diffusion welder, and then with those in the grasp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our great pincer-hands were pulling ourselves toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flier's screw-door. In a moment we had that open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were crowding into the little vestibule-chamber which</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay between the outer and inner doors. Closing the inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">one tightly behind us, we swiftly screwed open the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. As it opened there was a rush of air from about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us as the air of the little vestibule-chamber rushed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the great airless void outside, and then Marlin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading the way out of that door, out into sheer space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside our falling space-flier!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw Marlin drawing himself in his space-walker</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the door and then floating gently out that door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating in space a few feet from our flier and falling at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same rate as it toward mighty Saturn! In a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">more I was following him, Whitely and Randall behind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and as I too propelled myself with a slight push</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the door, my cylindrical space-walker floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward. I found myself, therefore, cased within that</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-walker's cylinder, and floating in it in the sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty void of interplanetary space! Beside me was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great gleaming .faceted ball of our flier, falling at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same rate as ourselves toward the huge rings of mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saturn, to the left. Beneath and before and on all other</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides of me, though, was only space, the tremendous gulf,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming with the great hosts of stars on all sides, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun's brilliant little disk shining far behind us. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment our position was so strange, so utterly alien</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unprecedented, as we four floated there beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling space-flier in our four great metal cylinders, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could only gaze about us in sheer awe and wonder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Marlin, with one of the great metal jointed arms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his space-walker, motioned to us and toward the flier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we realized that we had but little time left in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accomplish the task now before us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For with every moment the flier and our four space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walkers were falling at greater speed toward the colossal</seg><seg type="columnLine">rings of huge. Saturn, to the left, and the whirling titanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteor-swarms of those rings were growing larger and</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger. But a few hours remained before, with the grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing acceleration of our free-falling flier, it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting its end in those clashing, crashing meteors of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great swarm, so that if we were to repair the damage</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it, and get its generators functioning again before it</seg><seg type="columnLine">met its doom, we must work fast. Our four space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walkers were falling toward Saturn at the same rate as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great flier beside us, so that we hung just beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">that flier in space without need to use the propelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-rays of our four cylinders. And now Marlin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasping with his great metal pincer hands one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">projecting joints of the flier's great faceted walls, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulling himself around it even as he fell with it through</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, was pulling himself around to its other side, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meteor that had struck us a glancing blow had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">its damage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment Whitely and Randall and I had followed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving clumsily in our great cylinders as we fell with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier on toward Saturn's rings, and as we reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side where Marlin was hovering now in his space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walker we saw that the meteor that had grazed us had</seg><seg type="columnLine">demolished two of the great facets of the flier's outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, and had shattered and crumpled a third. Save for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight denting, though, the inner wall seemed unharmed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fact that alone had saved us, but the black cable-</seg><seg type="columnLine">connections between the walls were broken in a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">score places, we saw. It was that severing of the connec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions that had halted our great generators, we knew,, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">now our first task was to repair those connections, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was upon that task that we began at once to work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surely never had men worked under stranger circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances than those, was my thought as we began the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">of re-matching the severed connections. For we four,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cased in our four great cylindrical metal space-walkers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were falling through space at a tremendous and ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasing rate, even as we worked upon our great flier</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling with us, we were falling through -the mighty void</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the whirling rings of Saturn, looming immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">in space beside us. It meant annihilation for us, if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not complete our repairs in time to escape them!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as we toiled there at the connections, it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me that never could we complete them in time to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great rings. For not only were there a half-score</seg><seg type="columnLine">120</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">breaks in the intricate cables, but each cable held within</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself a dozen smaller connections or strands that in each</seg><seg type="columnLine">break must be exactly rematched. And working as we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the great pincer-claws of the space-walker our prog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ress was terribly slow. Minutes passed into an hour and</seg><seg type="columnLine">another hour, as we labored furiously there outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier with those connections, and by then it seemed to us</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the colossal rings of Saturn, a huge whirling storm of</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteors, were but a few minutes from us, so vastly did</seg><seg type="columnLine">they loom before us, and so swiftly were we and our flier</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling. With the energy of utter despair we labored on</seg><seg type="columnLine">there at the seemingly endless task of rejoining the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricate connections, our tools and materials that we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not using at the moment being simply released by us be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side us, since they fell with us and our flier at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate toward Saturn and thus were within our grasp, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">tools floated there beside us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW we were approaching the last of the connec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, but now too we saw that it was only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of minutes before our space-flier and we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be whirling into the edge of the mighty rings of Saturn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that loomed now gigantic in their spinning meteor-masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">before us! Already meteors were driving about us in</seg><seg type="columnLine">space more thickly, and only by a miracle had our</seg><seg type="columnLine">lielplessly-falling flier escaped them so far. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible that we could complete our task before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier and ourselves were shot into the crashing death of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those colossal whirling meteor - swarms, but we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">working with the mad energy of a forlorn hope, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now too Marlin was leaning toward us with his space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walker to shout something to us. For when one space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walker touched another, their two occupants could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other's shouts, the sound-vibrations. carried through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the touching metal sides. Marlin was crying to us that</seg><seg type="columnLine">but minutes were left us, and was ordering Randall to</seg><seg type="columnLine">return back inside the flier and stand ready there to shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">it away from the great-looming rings the instant that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">connections were repaired!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment Randall had obeyed, pulling himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the falling flier to its door and inside, white</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin and WHitely and I worked tensely upon the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the connections, matching and joining them with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest speed of which we were capable. Now it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that greater meteors were all about us, and now the huger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">denser masses of the mighty rings were towering vastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside us, as at plummet-like speed our flier and our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves whirled toward them and toward death! Hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in sheer space at the falling flier's side, working</seg><seg type="columnLine">madly upon those last connections, with all about us the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittering hosts of the stars and with beside us the titanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk of great Saturn and its colossal rings, we seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught in some unreal and torturing nightmare. Then as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huge meteor-masses of the mighty rings loomed just</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside us, as I reached with the pincer-hands of my space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walker toward the last of the connections, I heard from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin in the space-walker touching mine a hoarse cry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">despair. But at that last moment my claw-hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly joining the last connection and in the next instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the steady throbbing of the great generators inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flier! In that instant we had grasped our tools with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one metal arm and with the other each of us had gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the flier's shattered outer wall. And then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as the flier and ourselves seemed hurtling straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the mighty wall of whirling meteors that was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great rings beside us, the space-flier, with us three hang-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing desperately to it, was hurtling away from those rings</seg><seg type="columnLine">as its great force-ray shot from inside toward them, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing at terrific mounting speed out from them into</seg><seg type="columnLine">space!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an instant, so terrific was the accelerating speed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flier beneath Randall's control inside, that we three,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging to the broken outer wall in our sp^ce-walkers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed on the point of being torn away from our grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it, of falling back to Saturn once more. But in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment more, with a great distance already between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flier and the huge rings that had almost been our</seg><seg type="columnLine">doom, Randall had halted it, was holding it motionless</seg><seg type="columnLine">in space by means of a steady force-ray. Then we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly repairing the break in its outer wall, by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the plates and tools to which we had clung, setting</seg><seg type="columnLine">those great plates in place to replace the three shattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones, and then welding them swiftly into the flier's outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall integrally by means of the molecular-diffusion in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strument. That done we pulled ourselves around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier's faceted surface to its outer door, opening that</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and closing it again once inside the vestibule-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber. Then as Marlin touched a stud the vestibule-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber was filling with air, and in another moment we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were inside the flier once more,' were pulling ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the great space-walkers, with Randall already out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his and at the controls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was almost our trip's end!" cried Marlin as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he emerged from his space-walker. "Another few min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes and we'd have been inside the rings--would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been pounded into instant annihilation by the meteors</seg><seg type="columnLine">there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I passed a hand over my brow. "Never again do I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to find myself in a situation like that," I said. "As</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was, it was the space-walkers alone that saved us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marlin nodded, gazing out toward great Saturn loom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing gigantic still to our left. "If ever we come back,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "if ever we try to reach Saturn and explore It</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we may some day, we'll have our work cut out for us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those mighty meteor-masses--those rings-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, at present the farther we get from Saturn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">better I'll feel," Whitely told us. "And I'm glad enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there's no other planet between us and Neptune, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least, for Uranus is far way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, recovering from the first shakiness of.the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">action from our awful peril, we turned with R'andall to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the consideration of our position. Our great ray that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shot back from the flier, and had pushed us by its</seg><seg type="columnLine">force out through the solar system, had been snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out by the halting of the generators, and we had now only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side-ray that was holding us out from Saturn. I sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested, therefore, that for the remainder of our trip out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Neptune we turn the space-flier's rear force-ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Saturn instead of earth, since earth by now had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwindled to a small bluish-white star far behind. To train</seg><seg type="columnLine">our rear force-ray upon earth and to adjust the mechan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ism that kept the ray trained automatically afterwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the object suggested, would take more time thanjf</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were simply to push the rear force-ray against great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saturn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marlin approved the suggestion, so after sending the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier out farther from Saturn and ahead of it by oblique</seg><seg type="columnLine">applications of the side-ray, we held it carefully in space</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it was headed toward the far green spot of Neptune,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then turned on the rear force-ray with half its full</seg><seg type="columnLine">power at the start. At once, with terrific acceleration, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were flashing on toward Neptune, the giant power of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">121</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ray pushing against Saturn and driving our flier ever out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. So tremendous was that acceleration, indeed, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite the shock-absorbing apparatus of our chairs we</seg><seg type="columnLine">came near to being overcome by the awful pressure upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. Yet it was necessary that we use the highest possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed and acceleration, now, for our former speed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">acceleration had been completely lost when the halting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the generators had allowed Saturn to pull us inward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And though we were now flashing out past Saturn's orbit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with only the orbit of'Uranus between us and our goal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune, we had still two-thirds of our journey before</seg><seg type="columnLine">usl So colossal are the distances between the great outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets, distances beside which the gaps between Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and earth and Venus and Mercury seem tiny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the utmost acceleration of speed that we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand, though, our space-flier was now hurtling-outward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its great force-ray pushing against Saturn with more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more power and sending us flashing forward with</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater and greater velocity. In the next dozen hours of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our flight we had reached again to the speed of five mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion miles an hour that had been ours before we had met</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our misadventure at Saturn. And as we hurtled on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune was slowly largening before our eyes, its dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant, tiny little spot of calm green light becoming bigger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighter, though very slowly. But the eyes of Marlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Whitely and Randall and myself were always upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">that green light-spot as we hurtled on, hour following</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour and day following day in our eventless onward flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the solar system's outer immensities of space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And still our speed was steadily growing until at last, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">thejime we approached Uranus' orbit, we were flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the great void at the space-flier's utmost velocity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than eight million miles an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was a speed colossal, yet so accustomed had we</seg><seg type="columnLine">four become to the space-flier's tremendous velocities</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it seemed not unusual to us. Flashing through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">void as we were, the only objects by which one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure speed were the planets before and behind us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and these changed in size so slowly as to make our speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem small. The greatest change to us in the attaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the space-flier's immense utmost speed was the change</seg><seg type="columnLine">of conditions inside the flier itself. Formerly the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of our constant acceleration had replaced to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">degree the effects of gravitation, that pressure forcing us</seg><seg type="columnLine">always towards the flier's rear, as we turned more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more power into our giant pushing ray, as we shot out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with greater and greater speed. But now, with our utmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed attained and that acceleration's pressure missing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we floated inside the flier as though entirely weightless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being attracted only very slightly toward the walls by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slight gravitational attraction of the flier's mass itself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So that now the straps across chairs and bunks and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">handholds here and there on the walls that we had pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided proved indispensable to us, indeed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was upon the fifteenth day after our start from</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, the first day of- July as I noted by earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckoning, that we crossed the orbit of Uranus. As we</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached that orbit, only our recording distance-dials,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, marking the fact that we were nearing the path</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Uranus, I stood or rather floated with Marlin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitely at the flier's rear windows, gazing backward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind us gleamed in the star-swept heavens the planets</seg><seg type="columnLine">past which we had come, and those others beyond them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Saturn with his vast rings that had almost been</seg><seg type="columnLine">our deaths was already dwindling fast, as our flier shot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">out from it with its force-ray pressing with ceaseless</seg><seg type="columnLine">power against it. Already the huge ringed planet was but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tiny yellow disk of light to our eyes, so far out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">it we were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the left, too, shone the white star of giant Jupiter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">small but intensely brilliant still, while farther distant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">infinitely fainter was the red spark that was Mars. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes shifted from these to the bluish light-point that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, and then beyond it to the little disk of brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire that was the sun, its light and heat reaching us now</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the smallest of quantities as we fled on into the chill</seg><seg type="columnLine">immensities of the outer reaches of the solar system.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There close beside that fiery little sun-disk we could also</seg><seg type="columnLine">make out the silvery little light-point that was Venus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by making use of a small hand-glasS could also</seg><seg type="columnLine">discern closer even beside the sun the tiny point of rosy</seg><seg type="columnLine">light that we knew to be Mercury, smallest and inmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all the planets. But as we watched there, as our space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier hurtled on at unvarying, colossal speed over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbit of Uranus, it was toward Uranus itself we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing. Far back from us on the solar system's other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side hung the green spot of light that was Uranus, boom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing onward in its vast path around the sun, but though</seg><seg type="columnLine">we watched steadily through the hand-glass toward it</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were unable to make out the four small moons that</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompany the great green planet, which shone with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper green even than the greenish spot of Neptune,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Uranus--Venus--Mercury-," said Marlin, as he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed musingly backward. "Those three we have not</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed, yet they're no greater mysteries to us than those</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we have passed. But some day-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some day-I repeated, staring back, lost in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thought myself, not completing, any more than Marlin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought that I had started to express.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor did I need to complete it, for as Marlin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitely and I stared back to where the sun's disk sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">its light bravely out across the unthinkable reaches of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space that separated us from it, our thoughts were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">on those three planets, on Uranus and Venus and Mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cury, and on those others, Mars and Jupiter and Saturn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we had passed. What wonders, unknown to us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">might not exist upon any of those worlds? But they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonders barred to us for the time, since time was the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of which we had the least, in our great rush out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward to the sun's outermost planet, in our desperate race</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward to attempt to save our own earth from the doom</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hovered over it. For still that doom cast its shadow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wing darkly over earth, still Whitely's instruments</seg><seg type="columnLine">informed us that the giant force-ray from Neptune was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbing back toward the sun, turning the sun ever faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same remorseless rate. So that it was toward Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune, after minutes, that we turned, taking our places in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our chairs beside Randall, at the controls, and gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him toward the planet far ahead that was our goal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now that we had crossed the orbit of Uranus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some two-thirds of our colossal journey's length lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind us, and Neptune was becoming ever brighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, its pale green spot of light having become almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">as brilliant to our eyes as Saturn, behind us. As we</seg><seg type="columnLine">viewed it through our telescope, too, we could make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiny light-poiht of Triton, the single moon of Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune. Somewhat larger than our own moon was Triton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we knew, and we could see through our glass what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">long been known by earth's astronomers, that this single</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon of Neptune's revolved about it in a plane sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">122</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">slanted or inclined to the plane of Neptune's equator, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the general plane of the ecliptic or solar system. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">close indeed seemed the light-point of this single moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Neptune, since we knew that it was at almost the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance from the great planet as our own moon is from</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was toward Neptune and its little moon that our</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes turned now and in the hours and days that fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed, while gradually our excitement became tense as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great planet loomed ahead of us. Soon it had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come a perceptible pale green disk, widening out as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot on and on toward it. We would reach it, we cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culated, upon the twenty-first day of our journey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-one days after starting from earth. An eternity</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed, that period of three weeks, such vast realms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of space we had come through, such tremendous perils</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had dared and passed. But now all those" perils</seg><seg type="columnLine">and worlds we had passed, Mars and the deadly asteroi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dal belt, great Jupiter and Saturn ^and the doom that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had almost been ours there, all these things faded from</seg><seg type="columnLine">our minds as we found ourselves with our thoughts con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated wholly upon the far planet that from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first had been our goal, that planet which we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach if earth was to be saved. For ever, ever, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great force-ray of Neptune was turning the sun faster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now less than a hundred days remained before</seg><seg type="columnLine">that turning sun would be no longer able to hold together,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be dividing and releasing fiery doom upon earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and almost all its other planets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What was awaiting us at Neptune? That was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question that was foremost in all our minds as we shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">on in those last tense days. What manner of beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would they be who, we had assumed, were stab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing this ray of doom toward the sun? What manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of beings could they be who could exist at all, if exist</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did, upon such a planet as Neptune, a planet moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the sun at the unthinkable distance of almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">three billion miles? Upon a planet that could receive</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a minute fraction only of the sun's light and heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">compared to that received on earth? Upon a planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">which astronomers had always believed to be of far</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesser density than earth, of a density little more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of liquids rather than of solids. Was it possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">that upon this farthest of all the sun's circling worlds</seg><seg type="columnLine">there could exist life of any kind, not to speak of life</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligent enough to stab across the solar system and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spin the sun itself faster to its division and its uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse's doom?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THOSE were the questions that throbbed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">our brains now as our hurtling space-flier shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">on and on, Neptune growing with each hour before us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By the nineteenth day its disk had expanded to such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a degree that we were able to discern upon it the cloud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">belts that had already long been seen upon it by earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomers. By the twentieth those great vapor-belts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were plainly perceptible, and also Triton, its moon, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become visible to our unaided eyes, revolving close about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great planet in its sharp-slanted plane, being now</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the planet but so much above it as to be com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely' visible to us. By the twentieth, too, the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind us had become hardly more than a super-bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant star, its tiny fiery disk bathing us still with a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain amount of light, although long before this we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ceased to rely upon its heat on our flier's sunward</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and had had recourse to our own -heating-mechanism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By this time too, of all the planets, only Jupiter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saturn were visible behind us; the rest were invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us at the colossal distances which now separated us</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not behind but ahead, though, that we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing, as our space-flier flashed over the last portion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its great trip, as Neptune apparently grew in size be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore us. Seated in my control-chair, with Whitely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin and Randall in their chairs beside me, I watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mighty planet fascinated, as we hurtled on toward it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the early hours of the twenty-first day, that day</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we had calculated would bring us to our goal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And truly, now, Neptune was looming in something of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its true greatness before us. Only a tiny point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light in a telescope on earth, hardly more than that on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long days of our journey outward, we saw it now</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some size and splendor, a huge cloud-belted world as</seg><seg type="columnLine">large almost exactly as Uranus, outrivaled in the solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">system only by it and by the two giants of Jupiter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Saturn. Over sixty times larger than our own earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was, a huge world spinning far out here at the solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">system's very edge, the last outpost of that solar sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem with beyond it only the awful emptiness of inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stellar space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silently we gazed toward its great, green disk, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">small gleaming moon, as our space-flier throbbed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward it. Whitely, as usual, was checking from time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to time the performance of the never-ceasing genera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors whose great force-ray, pressing against Saturn still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hurling us forward. Randall was gazing forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me, helping me now and then to ascertain from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed and distance dials our distance from the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet. Marlin had applied himself to the telescope, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing ahead through it toward the big world's cloud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreathed surface, touching a focusing wheel now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then. For minutes we throbbed on thus, the beat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators the only sound in the hurtling space-flier's</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior, but at last Marlin drew back from the telescope's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyepiece and frowned as he gazed toward the great green</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can make out nothing through those cloud-belts,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "Those belts show, as astronomers have always</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed, that Neptune has a great atmosphere. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">what lies beneath them we'll not know until we pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trate through them to the planet's surface."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That won't be long," I told him. "We're already</seg><seg type="columnLine">only fifty million miles from Neptune--should reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in seven or eight hours more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You'll be slowing the flier's speed before long then?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Whitely, and I nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll wait until we're ten million miles from it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then cut out our rear-ray that's pushing us on, and send</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a front force-ray toward Nepttrtie to break our</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those next several hours, however, seemed to us in</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing to be drawn out to infinite length, so great had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become our suspense. At last, however, as we stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely ahead, Randall gave the word beside me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked our place as within ten million miles of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great planet, which had now grown to a vast pale-</seg><seg type="columnLine">green cloudy disk in the heavens before us. And as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave that word I snapped shut one of the six switches</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me, turning off the great rear force-ray of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier, and at the same moment snapped open another</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch that sent a great force-ray stabbing straight out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ray-opening in the flier's front, stabbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">straight out toward the great disk of Neptune ahead!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost at once our mad flight toward that huge world</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to diminish in speed. Minute by minute the fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures on the speed-dial crept backward, so that from</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight million miles an hour our speed dropped quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to six million, and then to four and to three and to two</seg><seg type="columnLine">million.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With this swift decreasing of our speed we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiencing now the reverse of that pressure that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been ours upon our acceleration, since now we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">straining upward and forward against the straps of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs, the pneumatic shock-absorbing apparatus of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs functioning now as it had done then. But though</seg><seg type="columnLine">we felt again the dizziness and slight nausea attendant</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon these tremendous changes of speed, we forgot that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our intent contemplation of the huge world that</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed but a million miles ahead, its tremendous pale-</seg><seg type="columnLine">green sphere, belted with great cloud-masses, seeming</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fill the heavens before us. Already Marlin, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments, had found as we neared Neptune that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant world's rotatory speed was a little more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty earth-hours, solving a problem that long had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied earth's astronomers by the discovery that the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet turned on its axis each score of hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An involuntary thrill of pride ran through me even</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we shot in toward those great cloud-masses_ that en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled Neptune. Neptune! The sun's farthest world, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we four had reached it, had shot across the awful gulf</seg><seg type="columnLine">that none had ever thought to span! Marlin, beside me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gazing forward into the great cloud-layers now with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the astronomical curiosity of all his career gleaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his gray eyes, as we approached this farthest of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar system's worlds. Whitely was contemplating it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his usual cool detachment, but thoughtfully. Ran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dall's face was as eager with interest as my own must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been, and when, a little later, there came a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounting roar of sound around our flashing space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier, the roar of an atmosphere through which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rushing, he uttered a low exclamation, swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">manipulated our outside air-tester, and then turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An atmosphere to Neptune, surely enough!" he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed. "About twice the pressure of earth's, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">this far out, and the air-tester shows a large percentage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water-vapor and rather larger amount of oxygen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Otherwise it seems much the same as earth's."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marlin nodded. "We should be able to move in that,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "but the greater gravitation of Neptune will</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably be such as to make it necessary to keep inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the space-walkers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now the space-flier was hurtling into the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapor-layers, that swirled about us in white mist-masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the pale light that came to us from the tiny, distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun. Onward and downward through those vapor-lay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, through the cloud-belts about the great planet, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-flier shot, while we four gazed ahead and down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, now with excitement keyed to an utter tenseness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then with sudden stunning surprise, for we had thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">those cloud-layers of immense thickness, our space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier shot out and down from them, shot down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear air, clear atmosphere. And as it did so, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four of us came simultaneous cries. For there in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale, dim unearthly light there stretched far away be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath us the surface of the planet that for so long had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been our goal on our great race to save earth from</seg><seg type="columnLine">doom, the surface of great Neptune!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg><seg type="columnLine">Into Neptune's Mysteries</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">" 1^ JW ETAL, over all Neptune's surface!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> VI "A metal-covered world!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> » A Our stunned, astounded exclamation sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">together there as we gazed downward from our flier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose drop I had instinctively halted. For it was metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed that lay beneath us, a gigantic surface of smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark metal or metallic substance that glinted dully in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pale light that fell on it, and that stretched away</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all directions to the horizons, completely covering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant planet Neptune as far as we could see! A metal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered world! In amazement, in awe, we stared down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it in that moment. For we had expected many</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, many aspects which the surface of Neptune</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have had, frozen ice-fields or flaming craters or</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a liquid world, but never had we expected what</seg><seg type="columnLine">we now saw beneath us. Never had we expected to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the huge planet thus sheathed in a dark metal cover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that apparently extended over all its gigantic surface!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in all its vast smooth expanse, we saw, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">110 higher structure of any sort, nothing but the level</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain of smooth dark metal,'sweeping far away to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat horizons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Neptune a metal-covered world! And I think I see</seg><seg type="columnLine">why, now," said Marlin quickly as we gazed down. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that I can understand why the beings of Neptune</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have covered their world with this shield-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But what lies beneath it ?" Randall asked. "Do you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mean that these beings of Neptune-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I mean that beneath this great shield they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">built must lie the real world of the being? of Neptune--</seg><seg type="columnLine">must lie the source of the giant force-ray that they're</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbing toward the sun I".-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how to get down inside?" said Whitely. "There</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seems no opening in this gigantic metal shield-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must go on, then," Marlin told us. "Must go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on until we .find some way of getting beneath, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath that shield there lies our goal!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment we stared toward each other, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had snapped open one of the switches before me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning the ray-direction dial, sending down slantwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the metal surface a force-ray, instead of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertical ray that had upheld our flier. The pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this slanting ray at once sent our ball-like space-flier</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving forward across Neptune's surface, across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth vast dark metal plain whose presence was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounding to us. I glanced at the outside-temperature</seg><seg type="columnLine">dial as we shot forward, saw that the atmosphere through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we moved though dense was cold indeed, hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">above zero in temperature. Then with Marlin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitely and Randall I turned my attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth great metal surface over which we were driving.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On and on we shot, though, without finding any slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">change or opening or structure in that, unending, dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal surface, that swept away in its vast, bare curve</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the horizons, which were very far from us, so great</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the radius of curvature of Neptune's mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere. But after tense moments of this fruitless watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">from our racing flier, Whitely uttered a low exclama;</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and pointed ahead, toward a round lighter circle in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark metal plain far to the left, a circular opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the giant metal shield!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> None other of us spoke as we gazed toward that</seg><seg type="columnLine">124</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">opening, but at once I had sent the space-flier rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward it. As we raced nearer to it we saw that that</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening's circle was a full five hundred feet in diameter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that we could see down through it a great, bright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit space beneath! Tensely we watched, until in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment I had sent the space-flier directly above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great opening, so that it hovered motionless above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular opening's center. And as it hung there we</seg><seg type="columnLine">four, forgetful for the moment of all else, were gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">down through the space-flier's window through that</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening, down into the great more brightly-lit space</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we could see beneath, beneath the huge metal shield</seg><seg type="columnLine">that covered all this world!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first thing that I noted, gazing downward, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the space beneath the giant metal roof of Neptune</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a great one, since it was a full mile from the open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in that roof to the surface of the world far below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gazing down toward that surface, seeing at last the true</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of Neptune lying in the brighter light that ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isted in some strange way beneath the gigantic metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof, we gasped. For upon that surface there loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless strange structures such as we had never seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. Rectangular in shape were those structures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with straight black walls, of great size but seeming</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather low in height, and they were without exception</seg><seg type="columnLine">roofless! In them we could dimly make out from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">great height the gleaming shapes of what seemed huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines of one sort or another, but could not at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">height see whether living beings of any sort moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the structures. The great circle of the world be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath that we could see, hanging above the opening, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely covered with these structures, the black walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one roofless building being surrounded on all sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the walls of others, there being no streets or open</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaces whatever between them! It was as though, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, all the surface of the great world beneath had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided into great compartments by a great checker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board arrangement of intersecting black walls!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marlin's eyes were gleaming with excitement as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed down. "The,city of the creatures of Neptune!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he breathed, as in awe we four stared down. "The city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Neptune that lies beneath the colossal roof, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">must hold somewhere that which we have come to seek!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're going to venture down into this city--down</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the great roof ?" I asked, and he nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must, Hunt, to find the giant force-ray's source.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But stand ready to flash the space-flier back upward--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for if we're discovered by whatever beings inhabit this</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange world, I think we'll get short shrift!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment we paused there, and then as my hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved upon the switch-controls, decreasing the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the force-ray that held us upward the space-flier was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinking smoothly and slowly downward, down through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great Opening! Tensely and with fascinated inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est we gazed about now as we sank into the great space</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lay beneath the huge metal roof. That space was</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighter-lit than above the roof, we saw, and as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned a moment to glance upward we saw that looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">upwards, the roof was perfectly transparent! Dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">opaque metal when seen from above, it was almost in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible in its transparency when seen from below! And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing that, we understood the great roof's purpose. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been constructed and placed above all Neptune, en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling the great planet and enclosing it, to retain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet's heat as much as" possible. For it was apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">that heat and light radiations or vibrations could not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pass up through the metal of the roof from beneath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making it appear black and perfectly opaque from above,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but could pass freely down through it from above, mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it appear almost perfectly transparent .from below!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EVEN as we grasped the wonder of that, though, we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-	had forgotten it, in the greater wonder of the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lay now before our eyes. For as we sank down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our space-flier into the great space beneath that roof we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the surface of great Neptune itself, stretching</seg><seg type="columnLine">far away beneath that mighty enclosing shield above it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and covered to the horizons by the strange rectangular</seg><seg type="columnLine">and roofless structures such as we had already seen. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">were formed, indeed, by smooth black walls of some two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet in height that ran in straight lines in</seg><seg type="columnLine">checker-board arrangement across all the surface of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge planet, apparently, forming upon all its surface,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without streets or parks or openings of any kind, a vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">city of rectangular compartments, large and small! A</seg><seg type="columnLine">titanic streetless city that covered apparently all the-sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of giant Neptune!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But most wonderful of all the things that lay before us</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that moment was the fact that nowhere about us could</seg><seg type="columnLine">we see any sign of supporting pillars or piers for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant roof that stretched far above us! For though we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could gaze far away to the distant horizons of this great</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, we could find no single support for that huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal roof that apparently covered all the great planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whose weight must have been incalculable! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">another feature of the giant roof puzzled us. It puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zled us to see the great openings in it like that down</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we had come, great circular openings which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see in it here and there at great distances from</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other. Those openings were provided on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">under-side with great sliding shutters for closing them</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly, yet all were open! Why should they be open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we silently asked ourselves, if the purpose of the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to retain Neptune's heat within that roof? For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the existence of those great and unclosed openings in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof must surely be defeating that purpose, for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside-temperature dial recorded the same zero tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture as prevailed above the roof!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet even these strange things could not wholly draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">our interest and attention from the strange compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment-city beneath, as our space-flier sank toward it. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were within a few hundred feet of it, now, and as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped nearer, Marlin and Whitely and Randall star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing eagerly down beside me, my hands were tense upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the switch-controls, ready to send our flier leaping in-*</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly upward. For if the beings of the city beneath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever their nature, caught sight of us, we could ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect nothing but instant attack. So that a tenseness held</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of us as our great flier's faceted polyhedron dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">on through the pale light beneath the great roof toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black-walled, checker-board like city that stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the surface of the great world beneath us. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, as we sank lower, our eyes were making out ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">more clearly the details of that amazing city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rectangular black-walled compartments held, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had half-realized from above, various strange-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanisms and objects which we could even now only</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguely discern. We could see clearly, though, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there across all the vast city's compartmented</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface there stood giant metal globes, each a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in diameter and each occupying a square compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of its own. There seemed hundreds of these great</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">125</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming globes, scattered here and there in compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments across the city's surface as far as we could see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though their purpose was then quite incomprehensible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. But as we sank lower still, ever more cautiously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not the globes or the compartments' contents that</seg><seg type="columnLine">held our attention so much as the astounding, stupefy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fact that now was thrust upon us--namely that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the gigantic compartmented city, in all its strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">great black-walled rectangular and roofless enclosures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there moved no living being!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dead !" Randall's cry expressed in that instant the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupefaction of all of us. "A dead world!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Neptune--a dead world!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dead world! For truly it seemed a dead world that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay there in the dim pale light beneath us! A world</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose strange contiguous compartments stretched away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from horizon to horizon to form the colossal city above</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we hovered, but a world, a city, in which was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">single discernible thing of life! The endless black-walled</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartments, the strange-shaped structures and mech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anisms, the great enigmatic globes--all these things lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath us in a silence and a death that were stunning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our senses! Lay beneath us as though death had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the unknown to annihilate suddenly all living</seg><seg type="columnLine">things upon this alien world, leaving in it only the cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the silence and the death that enwrapped it now!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune--we had flown across the awful void toward it</seg><seg type="columnLine">for week upon week, prepared to find within it any</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange beings, any alien and terrible form of life, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">never had we been prepared to find it without any life</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever--an utterly lifeless world!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we stared down toward it in utter silence it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me that my brain was spinning from the stupefying</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock of amazement that was ours. For if the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath us was truly a dead one, if Neptune lay now</seg><seg type="columnLine">without life, its colossal compartment-city entirely life-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, whence came that giant force-ray that was stabbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the solar system from Neptune to turn the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever faster toward its division? Whence came that</seg><seg type="columnLine">doom which was being loosed upon our earth and upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the solar system, almost, by that gigantic ray ? Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that great ray, after all, only some incomprehensible</seg><seg type="columnLine">freak of natural forces, impossible to withstand, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had Neptune, once the home of some alien, mighty civi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lization, lain for eons in silence and death? Had our</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate mission which alone held a chance for earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our terrific race out through the unthinkable reaches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the solar system's spaces toward its outermost planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in vain?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marlin must have felt something of the same despair</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that moment, but his strong face betrayed no trace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it as he turned to us. "It's evident that his vast com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment-city, this whole world, perhaps, is deserted,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "But where does the great ray come from?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whitely shook his head, glancing at his instruments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Impossible to say," he said. "The recording-instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments here show only that we are close to the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray's source, that that source is in the region around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune. But the emanations or reflections from it</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking the instruments are so powerful as to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">it imposible to determine the ray's source exactly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the city beneath!" I cried. "Even if it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead, deserted, we might be able to find in it some clue</seg><seg type="columnLine">to what has happened here, some idea of what manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of creatures the Neptunians were, and perhaps some clue</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the great ray's source!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">, Marlin pondered, then nodded. "Hunt's right," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "If we explore this deserted compartment-city be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath we may find some suggestion that will lead us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great ray's source. And we must find out soon, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">only eighty-five days are left before the sun divides into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a double star and dooms earth!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But we shouldn't risk all of us on this venture," I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said. "The safest way would be to keep the space-flier,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with two of us inside, hovering here above the city while</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the other two go down to it and explore it in their space-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">walkers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This we finally agreed to do, and Marlin and I in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sisted upon being the two to make the venture, Whitely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and Randall reluctantly agreeing at last to remain within</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the space-flier, watching and waiting for us. So, bring-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing the space-flier down to a height of a thousand feet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">above the compartmented city, I set the force-ray to hold</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it motionless there, Randall taking my place at its con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trols. Then Marlin and I were quickly getting into our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">two cylindrical space-walkers. Once inside them, we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">each gripped in a great pincer-hand the pointed bars of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">steel that we were to take with us, and then unscrewed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the inner door and passed into the vestibule-chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Another moment and with the inner door closed, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">outer one was swinging open, and the denser and colder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">air from without was rushing into the vestibule-chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We did not feel its cold, however, snug in the insulated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and heated cylinders of the space-walkers, but drew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ourselves to the outer door, turning on the force-rays</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the bottoms of our cylinders. Then as we drew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ourselves out through the door and into empty air, we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were both sinking gently downward, our fall slowed to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a mere floating drop by the down-pressing power of our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">force-rays.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">DOWN through the dim pale light of Neptune's day</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we sank, down until just beneath us l$y one of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">intersecting black walls. As I saw this I shot my sup-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">porting force-ray outward at a slant, and as this sent me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down obliquely, I floated down past that wall, Marlin</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">doing the same beside me, and in another moment we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had come gently to rest just above the black smooth floor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of one of the great compartments, the force-rays from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the bottoms of our space-walkers holding us a foot or so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">above the floor. Resting there, Marlin and I looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up first. Beside us towered the black two-hundred foot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wall of the compartment, and far above we could make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out the hovering space-flier, its great gleaming poly-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hedron hanging motionless and watchful above. We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">waved the great metal arms of our space-walkers toward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it, toward Whitely and Randall inside it, and then turned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to examine the place in which we stood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was an oblong compartment some four hundred feet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in length, and half that in width, its great black walls</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">towering on all sides of us. Ranged around the compart-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment against those walls were rows of strange squat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mechanisms of a roughly pear-like form, that loomed each</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a score of feet in height. Marlin and I shot our space-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">walkers toward the nearest of these mechanisms, to ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">, amine it. We saw that in the top of it was an odd cone-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like opening, and that there ran out of the gleaming</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">metal cover of the thing a thick pipe or tube that con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nected with a larger pipe that encircled the compartment,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">connected to each of the mechanisms. Then as we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reached forward, swung aside the metal cover of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mechanism, exposing an intricate system of sections in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">126</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">side it through which ran slender tubes acted upon by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what seemed projectors of electro-magnetic force about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them, Marlin pointed toward them, leaned toward me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">until his space-walker touched mine and spoke to me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through the touching metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A water-making mechanism this seems to be, Hunt,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "In some way it must draw down ceaseless sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plies of hydrogen and oxygen atoms from the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapor-masses above the roof, and then recombine tiiem</seg><seg type="columnLine">here into water."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded, gazing at the thing. "But it hasn't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">used for years--for centuries, perhaps," I said. "Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that dust upon it-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For upon the pear-shaped mechanism before us, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on all those others and all other things about us, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested a coating of fine dust that was inches thick, a dust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coating that we knew only a great period of time could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have deposited there. A moment we stared at that, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">grotesque figures there in the great cylinders of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-walkers, and then were moving on, along the wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That black smooth wall, we saw now, was composed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a material that looked much like a black seamless</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone, but one that seemed diamond-hard. For our</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed steel bars could make not the slightest impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it, and it was evident, from the monolithic construc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the great walls about us and of the smooth black</seg><seg type="columnLine">paving upon which we walked, that this diamond-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth stone had been artificially made. Later we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn that it was constructed by a building up of mole-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cules into a deliberate crystalline formation that far ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded the strength and stability of any other material's</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystalline structure, and thus gave to the black artificial</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone a diamond-like hardness and a tensile strength ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeding that of steel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Around the great compartment we walked, our eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranging over the great pear-shaped mechanisms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great pipes connecting them, and then Marlin and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped short. For there in the black wall before us was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a door, an opening that connected with the adjoining</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment on that side. It was by means of doors like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, it was plain, that the necessity of streets in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment-city bad been obviated, making it possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pass across the city through the compartments them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves if needed. Yet it was in stupefying surprise that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin and I now gazed toward that door. For it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of six feet in width, but hardly more than four feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in height! Its opening stretched there in the black wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though an ordinary door-opening of one of earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings had been set in that wall sidewise! And as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we looked stunnedly about we saw that all the doors set</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the compartment's four walls were of the same size</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shape!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those doors!" I cried to Marlin, leaning beside'me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Those were never made for human beings or for near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then these Neptunians that once were here--" Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin began, and then stopped; we-gazed in silence at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other through the vision-windows of our space-walkers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And silence seemed oppressive all about us then, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence that lay as thickly over the deserted compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment-city as the thick dust of unguessable years that cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered it. A chill seemed to have struck home to us in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some strange fashion with the discovery of those gro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tesque door-openings and their significance. I glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward, saw that the faceted ball of the space-flier was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still hanging motionless high above, and then as I turned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">back saw that Marlin had moved toward the low door</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward which we had been gazing. A moment he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">templated it, then motioned to me with the big metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm of his space-walker, and as I came to his side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped that door's edge with his great arms and lowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his space-walker's big cylinder until it lay on its side on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smooth black paving. Then he was drawing it</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the door, aiding himself with a force-ray shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the opening in its bottom toward the compartment's</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite wall behind us. When he was through, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew himself erect, and in a moment I had followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Him and was standing with him in the next compartment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That second compartment, we found, was a replica</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the first, being of the same size and holding within</seg><seg type="columnLine">it several dozen more of the pear-shaped water-manu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">facturing mechanisms. We passed through it, therefore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the dust-strewn paving and through the low similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">door on its opposite side, to find ourselves in still another</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment of water-manufacturers. Pressing on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly becoming able to pass through the low strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors easily in our cumbrous space-walkers, we passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a half-score more of similar compartments all</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding only the dust-covered, pear-shaped water-mech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anisms, and then at last we passed into a different com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment, one that held a strange shelving that covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">all its walls, at which we stared in perplexity for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This shelving consisted of horizontal and perpendicular</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelves of smooth black stone like that of the walls them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves, running along and up and down those walls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming thus a continuous series of box-like openings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each some four feet in length and two in height. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hundreds of these'shelves in the compartment, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see, yet all of them were quite empty, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment there seemed to be no other object. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested the equipment of'a store-room, yet there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no faintest clue as to what had been stored in those shelf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiers of openings, ranged one above the other all around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls. Had Marlin and I been able to guess the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounding truth as to those tiers of compartments as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their significance and purpose, much would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear to us right then. As it was, after vainly endeavor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to fathom the purpose of the things, we gave it up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and moved on out of the compartment, and through</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar shelf-tiered compartments beyond it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BY this time we had passed some distance from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath our hovering space-flier, but still could see its</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming polyhedron hanging high in the air behind us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reassured by the sight of it, we passed on, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next half-hour progressed through many more com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partments. Some of these contained water-manufactur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing mechanisms or tiers of strange shelf-openings such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we had already'seen. But many others held mechan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isms or objects strange to our eyes, before which Marlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I stood entranced. We almost forgot, in the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">powering interest of the things that we found in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartments, the object of our exploring search through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange compartment-city, our search for clues as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beings of Neptune and as to the great force-ray that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was turning the sun ever faster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Compartments we found in which were structures</seg><seg type="columnLine">that puzzled us as completely as had the tiers of shelf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings. These structures were great flat metal con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainers, each scores of feet in length and width but</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly more than a foot or two in depth. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">127</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged one above the pther in great supporting frame-</seg><seg type="columnLine">works, and each container was filled with black fine soil.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The compartments that held these had set in their walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">great white disks which were connected to intricate ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus that seemed generators of some kind of force,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but more than that we could not ascertain from our in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spection of them. The whole arrangement, the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">shallow containers of soil, the disks in the walls, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators connected to them--all was utterly enigmatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and perplexing to us, and we were forced to give up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">riddles and pass on into other compartments, in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were other things almost as mysterious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some held giant globes of burnished metal, now dust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered, which occupied almost a whole compartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">each. These great gleaming globes were among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most puzzling things we had found, since there was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the compartment of each one, no other object or indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation of their purpose, save for a few switches mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a panel, the combination of which we could not dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover, opening and closing them in vain. We had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">these great globes from above, dotting the vast compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment-city here and there in great numbers, but we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn no more of their purpose standing there beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">them than we had been able to guess from above. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">near these there were strange looming machines, many-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cogged and with a great hopper above whose purpose we</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed, at least, guessing that these were the mechan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isms that produced from some raw materials the arti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficial diamond-hard black stone-material that made up</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the intersecting walls of this strange huge city-world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each of these machines had before it a very low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">round metal seat, with in front of that seat the controls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the machine, a half-dozen burnished metal levers. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw them Marlin and I exchanged startled glances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had the being who operated that machine, who sat be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore it, held and operated all those control-levers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism? Back to our minds flashed the strange low</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings of the doors through which we had come, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment the same strange sense of dread chilled me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I shook off the feeling, followed Marlin on into</seg><seg type="columnLine">another compartment, glancing back through to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">our space-flier poised in the air now far across the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was into another long rectangular compartment that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we passed, one that held, like that out of which we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just come, rows of strange many-cogged mechanisms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But one feature of that compartment caught our atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion instantly, held us motionless and staring. And that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that those rows of great mechanisms were not com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete! Here and there in those rows were gaps, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though machines had been removed from the compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and where those gaps were, where the missing</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines had stood, were squares on the floor where</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bases had rested, squares that were entirely free of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inch-thick dust that lay over all else! And even as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we stared, as we comprehended the astounding sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificance of that, we saw that upon the dust-coated floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">before us were many tracks, small round and strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks in the thick dust that were of great number and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been made, it was apparent from their dust^</seg><seg type="columnLine">free condition, but days or hours before!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Marlin!" I whispered, grasping my companion's</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-walker with the great metal arm of my own and</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching head casing to head casing. "Marlin--those</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks--someone, something has been here---and but re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cently!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "It can't be!" he exclaimed, his voice hushed strangely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like my own. "Neptune--all this great compartment-city</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--it's all dead, deserted-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But those tracks!" I insisted. "Those squares in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the dust--something's been here and has taken a half-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dozen of these great machines away with them! And we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">know that something on Neptune is sending the great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">force-ray out to the sun!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It can't be," Marlin repeated. "We found no source</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the great ray on Neptune's sunward side, and, too,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">how can that ray shoot always toward the sun from some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spot on Neptune, when Neptune itself is constantly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turning? No, Hunt, I think that this means--but look</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As he cried out he was gazing suddenly upward, his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">space-walker's great arms pointing up, and at that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">horror-stricken cry, I glanced up to see a sight that froze</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me motionless there in astonishment. For there, high</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">above us and above the great compartment-city, a dozen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strange great shapes were dropping down through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">air toward us, were dropping down through one of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">openings in the great roof! Long great cylinders of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gleaming metal those shapes seemed, dropping silently</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and smoothly down from the opening, toward the com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">partment-city, but even as we looked in amazement and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">terror up toward them, they had halted in mid-air, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">though seeing the faceted ball of our hovering space-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flier hanging above the city far behind us. Then the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">next instant all the dozen great cylinders were flashing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with unbelievable speed toward our space-flier, a half-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">score narrow, pencil-like rays of pale, almost invisible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">light or force stabbing ahead of them toward the space-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flier!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Marlin and I cried out in the same instant as those great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cylinders whirled through the air toward the space-flier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and in that moment it seemed to us that our wild cries</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had been heard, for we saw the space-flier whirl itself to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one side suddenly, as though Randall and Whitely in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it had caught sight suddenly of that onrushing menace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The pale, almost unseen stabbing little rays of force or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">light shot past them as they swerved thus, and then the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">next moment cylinders and space-flier seemed to be whirl-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing in a wild melange of geometrical metal forms there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the pale dim light above the great compartment-citv.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We saw the slender, pencil-like shafts of force stabbing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this way and that, saw one cylinder, struck by the shafts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of its fellows, riven asunder by those shafts as though</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by swords of steel and then suddenly the gleaming poly-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hedron of the space-flier had plunged up out of the wild</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">melee and was rocketing up toward one of the great open-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ings in the vast roof above!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As Whitely and Randall thus whirled the space-flier</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up in an effort to escape their outnumbering, unkhown</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attackers, we saw three of the great cylinders rushing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up after them. In another moment the space-flier, closely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">followed by its three pursuers, had rushed up through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the opening and disappeared above, and as they did «b</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we saw'that the remaining eight cylinders were dropping</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">now again toward the compartment-city! Watching</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">, stupefied still in our amazement, Marlin and I saw that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">four of the cylinders were heading down toward a point</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the great city somewhat to the right of us, while the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other four were slanting down now almost straight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">toward the compartment in which we stood! And as I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saw that, as I saw and understood the significance of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tracks and missing mechanisms in this compartment,.</seg><seg type="columnLine">128</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I grasped Marlin's great metal -arm with one of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own, again touching head-armors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're coming down to this compartment!" I cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It was they who took the missing mechanisms from</seg><seg type="columnLine">here--they've come for more!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Out of the compartment, then!" Marlin shouted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They're after Whitely and Randall in the flier, and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they find us here-!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the words we were throwing ourselves, prisoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our great cumbrous space-walkers as we were, toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the low door through which we had come. In a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were through that door, were in the adjoining com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment, but hardly had we gained it than there swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the pale light from high above four great</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylindrical shapes, slanting smoothly down toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment we had just left! From above they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see us easily, whatever beings were inside those descend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cylinders, so that as they shot down over our roofless</seg><seg type="columnLine">great compartment, Marlin and I poised motionless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">praying that our great gleaming space-walkers might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaken for mechanisms. Far across the compartment-</seg><seg type="columnLine">city we could glimpse the four other cylinders dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">down toward a different point, also, and then in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next moment the four above us had shot down over us</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with a throbbing sound coming clearly to us from</seg><seg type="columnLine">those cylinders' interiors, were coming to rest in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment we had just left!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GLANCING for a moment at each other through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision-windows -of our space-walkers, Marlin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I then softly moved in them toward the low door through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we had just come. For though our fear was great,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our curiosity, our realization of the mission that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought us out here to Neptune, was greater. In a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment we were at the door, were lowering ourselves awk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wardly and silently to a position from which we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze through it into the adjoining compartment. In that</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparunent, we saw now, the four great cylinders had</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed, and were resting upon the floor at its center.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each cylinder was of forty feet diameter and twice that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in height, and their gleaming metal sides were broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there by small windows. They were broken too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw with a start, by ray-openings like those of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own space-flier, and it was evident from those that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders were propelled through space by the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-rays that moved our flier!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before we could fully comprehend the meaning of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, though, there came a low clanking of metal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">before our eyes a section in each of the curving sides of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinders, near the base of cach, was abruptly sliding</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside, leaving in the metal wall of each cylinder a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">oblong door-opening like those of the compartments</seg><seg type="columnLine">about us. Now we heard from inside that opening a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stir of movement, and saw vaguely a shape or shapes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that moved in the cylinder's dark interior. Then, as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed with tense nerves toward that opening, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved out of the cylinder's dark interior through that</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening, into the pale dim light of the Neptunian day, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature at which Marlin and I stared in that moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">with horror-stunned minds! A being so grotesque and ,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so awful in appearance that for the moment it seemed '</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me that it needs must be a creation only of our over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained nerves and brains!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a creature that bore no conceivable resemblance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the human form or to any other in our knowledge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The body was a great flat disk of pale-green flesh, five</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in diameter and hardly a foot in thickness. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">supported in a flat or horizontal position above the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">by seven short thick limbs of muscle or flesh, which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">each three feet in length and which projected down from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big disk-body at equal intervals around its circle. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only visible features of the creature were the eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. The eyes were two in number, and were set close</seg><seg type="columnLine">together in the edge of the disk body. They were like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of some insect, being each inches across and bulging</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward, being composed each of a myriad smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistening lens-divisions, like the eye of a fly! And as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw with shuddering horror those two bulging strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes gazing about, it came to me that it was only by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of such great, powerful eyes and their many lenses</seg><seg type="columnLine">that any creature here in the dim light of Neptune could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see clearly all things about it !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mouth was a white-lipped circular opening, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was set at the very center of the horizontal disk-body's</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper surface! No stranger combination can be imagined</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that which presented itself thus in the appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that creature before us, with the two bulging glassy</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes staring forth from the edge of the great disk-body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the round mouth gaping there in that disk-body's</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat upper surface. Slung around the disk-body the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture wore a flexible armor or dress of connected straps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flexible metal. In a loop of this rested a metal tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed by the joining together of two tubes of dissimilar</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickness. And attached to the flexible straps in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">position, at the disk-body's edge, was one of the strangest</seg><seg type="columnLine">features of its appearance, a small metal ball that seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing with unceasing radiant light!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The creature gazed about him, unaware of our awe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken gaze, and then half-turned and seemed to call</seg><seg type="columnLine">to others in the cylinder from which he had emerged, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange sound issuing from his mouth-opening. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound was like a swift succession of staccato snaps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound, as clear and sharp as the snap of metal on metal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the variation in their utterance, though they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a single pitch only, it was evident that they formed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech of the strange creature, and as he gave utterance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them, others like him, other similar disk-bodied green</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings, were emerging from the cylinder behind him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the other cylinders. In a moment a score or more</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gathered there, moving toward the great cogged</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanisms beside them, and as they did so the staccato</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapping of their strange speech came loud to our ears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as they did so, too, we saw that the seven strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs of each of them served him as arms as well as sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porting legs, since some used some of those limbs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry tools, holding them tightly in fingerless, muscled</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Neptunians!" whispered Marlin beside me. "Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunians, Hunt--those squat, flat disk-bodies--those great</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes-!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neptunians! Yet I had seen myself that they must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, that only on a great planet like Neptune, with far</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater gravitational power than earth, could.those squat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat bodies have evolved. For the greater the power of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet's gravitation, the lower and the more squat will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forms of life,that evolve upon it. And just as these</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunians had evolved in their strange disk-form here</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the great planet, due to its greater gravitational power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so had their great light-gathering eyes been evolved by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dimness that reigned here always. And it was these</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings, it was clear, who had built the vast compartment-</seg><seg type="columnLine">city that covered all of the great planet's surface about</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">129</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">us, since it was only beings like these who would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">built such strange, low doors in it for their own flat disk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies, only such beings as these who, with their seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">great limbs, could manipulate the controls of the mechan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isms we had seen!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Neptunians!" I whispered it, myself. "But if it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings like these who inhabit Neptune, who have sent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great force-ray stabbing toward the sun to divide it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where are they all? Why have they left all this city, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this world, dead and deserted?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marlin, inside his space-walker, shook his head. "God</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows, Hunt! If all these Neptunians have deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">their world, where have they gone? I know no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than you. But it's clear that they've come back for more</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those great mechanisms."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was, indeed, evident that that was the object of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunians' visit to the compartment-city, for now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">score or more in the adjoining compartment were busily</seg><seg type="columnLine">working with their tools upon three or four of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">cogged mechanisms that loomed there. Swiftly they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking down those mechanisms, were dissembling them</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a myriad intricate parts which were stowed away</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the four great cylinders. More than once some of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed close to the low door through which Marlin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I were gazing, but none ventured through it into the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment in which we hid, seeming all to be intent upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the business at hand. And as they worked on we began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand some of the features about them that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled us in our first horror-stricken sight of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had been puzzled, indeed, that they were able thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move about unheedingly without protection of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort in the zero-cold that reigned about us. But now as</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or two of them passed close to the door by which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we crouched, I gazed closely at the glowing little ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">that each had attached to his metal armor, and guessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">then what I was later to learn was the truth, that that ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">was glowing with radiant heat and had the power of heat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to comfortable temperature the atmosphere for a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet directly around its wearer. Thus the wearer of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved always in a little volume of warm air, though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air outside that area might be at zero temperature. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus it was that the Neptunians were able to withstand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the bitter cold about us, from which we were protected</seg><seg type="columnLine">by our space-walkers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we gazed toward the Neptunians, they were com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleting the process of dissembling and stowing away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great mechanisms, and now I moved closer to Marlin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my thoughts being on retreat from the dangerous position</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which we were. Not only might we be discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">at any moment by the Neptunians before us, but some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where in the compartment-city behind us were others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we knew, who had landed in their four cylinders at an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other point. Whatever had happened to Whitely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall in the space-flier, Marlin and myself were in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most perilous of positions. Even were we to escape the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunians we could not exist for long in our space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walkers in this dead and deserted city, in the cold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this strange and terrible world of death. Yet to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them was our first consideration, and I whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much to Marlin through our touching space-walkers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've got to get clear of these Neptunians," I whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered to him. "Back farther in the city we can hide until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was gazing toward the strange creatures and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tools and mechanisms with intense scientific interest, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned toward me at my whisper. "We'll get back, then,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he whispered. "It may be that Whitely and Randall-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a sentence that he never finished. For we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly turned to cross the compartment in which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched than we had to stop short in our space-walkers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There behind us a dozen or more great disk-creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been standing--a dozen or more great Neptunians!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even as we faced them there in that stunned moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bulging glassy eyes upon us, I saw the tracks in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thick dust at our feet, realized that these creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of the others who had landed in the compartment-</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, and that finding our space-walkers'-tracks here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in the thick dust, they had followed them, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">trailed us and stolen behind us while we watched their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows!

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes often refer to a microscope of some kind, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he could not have made the discoveries that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did. This instrument must have possessed such power</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could see atoms within the molecules, perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the electrons and protons within the atoms. In this</seg><seg type="columnLine">way he could actually see and study a life-cell, atom by</seg><seg type="columnLine">atom, molecule by molecule. And so he could find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they contained and how they were put together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In this way he analyzed those complex organic substances</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a way that left nothing to be desired. After analysis</seg><seg type="columnLine">came synthesis, and my father worked out the most intri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate chemical processes and equations in the world and</seg><seg type="columnLine">put them on paper. We can duplicate his results, but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot perform the analysis without his lost instrument.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We have no instructions for the creation of a dog; with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his instrument, which is perhaps the greatest part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his discoveries, we could not discover the process that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would lead to the making of a dog. But that does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that a dog could not be artificially produced. A dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">or, for that matter, a human being, consists only of a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain number of elements, put together in a complex man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner. As a result we have life, and an imperfect organism</seg><seg type="columnLine">that will support life for a period of time averaging</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat less than a century.

After we had carried out several</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand separate operations and had put together the</seg><seg type="columnLine">few cells that were to be this rabbit, we found we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing more to do! The rabbit developed to maturity</seg><seg type="columnLine">in astonishingly short time. In three hours he was full</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown, for we provided him with food enough. First</seg><seg type="columnLine">we nourished him with injected carbohydrates made up</seg><seg type="columnLine">of suitable organic compounds, then later we fed him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the usual way. He grew before our eyes. Metabolism</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded at an unprecedented rate, a rate that I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">never have believed possible if I had not seen it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight of us were astounded by the thing. In the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">most exciting hours of my life that thing grew from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">microscopic artificially manufactured egg to a full-grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabbit. Then the hectic rush ceased.

All things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even time, are relative. A day is many years to the fly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lives for that period only. All the first half of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabbit's life was crowded into three hours, incredible as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seems. Oh, there's some reason for it, but we don't ,</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what. When it reached maturity it stopped, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowed down to a normal life. I wonder why. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are dealing with unknown forces. As we do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">possess that instrument of my father's we can only fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low his instructions blindly.

We are doing that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think you are going too far, Graham," I replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Even admitting that you could duplicate the body of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, would you not be entirely powerless to give him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul? The soul is not an intricate compound of carbon</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydrogen, nitrogen, and other elements; it is independ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent of the body. If you create a man, he will be a soul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, conscienceless, artificial product, not a human being.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He might be very dangerous. It is always dangerous to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meddle with the affairs of God and nature."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, Von. Let me show my side of the case. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first place, you seem to be a victim of the popular and</seg><seg type="columnLine">widespread idea that if man creates intelligence, that in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligence will destroy him, the superstitious and unkill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able idea of Frankenstein, who crcated the famous mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster. There is no logical justification for such a belief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why should not a man, produced artificially in a labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory, be in every respect as fine a man, mentally, morally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and physically, as any man naturally born? The latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">product is nowhere near perfection even yet, after these</seg><seg type="columnLine">few thousand years of humanity. I'm inclined to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my laboratory specimen will be a better man than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">average. He will not be handicapped by the inherited</seg><seg type="columnLine">weaknesses and ancestral faults which influence the all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us, even the best of us. In the second place, again</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrary to popular delusions, that thing we call soul,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever it is, is dependent upon the body. If a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes drugs habitually, not only his body will be wrecked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but very soon his entire character undergoes a change.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every outward manifestation of the soul is changed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet drugs are not spiritual, but actual physical objects,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which do not act through the fourth dimension or in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other mysterious way to reach his soul. They affect</seg><seg type="columnLine">the physical body upon which that soul, whatever it is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is dependent. In the third place, all 'spirit mediums,' to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contrary, we have not yet even one authentic, prov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able case of communication with a disembodied spirit, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">we reach the conclusion that the body is a necessity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">any soul to make itself known on earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We do not know where the soul of a newborn child</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes from, but it's there. It's there as a consequence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the body being there. We do not believe any child</seg><seg type="columnLine">is bom without a soul, do we? Nor do we know of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul coming into being without a physical body. In all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our experience so far, we find that the former is de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendent upon the latter, and we do not find any case of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one without the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see no reason why my laboratory man should be an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exception to the rule.

The other girl, the one the news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers call the Flaming Atom, must have glanced up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white plane just in time to get that pencil of heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">across her eyes. She'll never see again, sir. I just came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from attending her as well as I could. She has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffering great pain, but she doesn't want an anaesthetic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had just finished bandaging her and was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">advise Garciac to call the police to investigate that white</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane when you crashed here. That same thin beam of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat rays crossed your wrist, and a minute ago I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticing where it had partially burned through your tail</seg><seg type="columnLine">surfaces. I hope the police catch the flyer. He hasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">got more than one full minute's start, but there are many</seg><seg type="columnLine">white planes in the sky at any hour of the day. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a good chance to escape, damn him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two stretcher-bearers were gently placing the Atom</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the cot in the ,Red Cross three-motored biplane. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">spotless white bandage was over her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will you take me to him, Vonnie?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am taking you to him, Elsie." (It was seldom that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham or I used her real name.) "If anyone in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">universe can give you back those eyes, he can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said nothing and leaned back against the cushions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I climbed into the cockpit. The escort of three police</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes, armed with deadly guns and manned by expert</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunners, had just arrived. We flew back to Atlantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">City. There was no trace of the white plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was soon in Graham's arms, on that high porch</seg><seg type="columnLine">overlooking the wide beach and the ocean. Neither of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them said anything. Words were superfluous. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing near them, I was slightly embarrassed and ill</seg><seg type="columnLine">at ease, and my shadow fell across the Atom's face. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to sense it somehow, held out her hand, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a blind step toward me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you, Vonnie," she said. "I--I guess I'm out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. I hope you get first place.",</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She's game through and through, that girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A short, heavyset man rushed out of the house and</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffed up to Graham. I recognized "him as Bronnsen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the seven scientists who were helping my friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his experiments. His excitement was so great that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was several moments before he could utter a coherent</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It has started, Greene. The man! The experiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been a success! It grows before our eyes 1 Soon we</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall have a synthetic man! What a triumph for science!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You must come quick!" He took hold of Graham's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeve and tried to pull him bodily toward the door lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the interior. Graham shook him loose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SYNTHETIC</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">135</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bronnsen, I can't come now. The seven of you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to take care of that from now on. Or six of you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather. Tell Arnold that I must see him. He must at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tend to this girl's eyes as well as he can, right now. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">we take care of the underlying tissues immediately maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">--please God--we can give her new eyes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arnold, I knew, was a surgeon of exceptional ability</seg><seg type="columnLine">and almost superhuman skill. Just what Graham's plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in regard to the girl's eyes, I did not know, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever it was, he could have confidence in the kindly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient and astoundingly skillful Arnold, who was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a remarkably able surgeon but a remarkably fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bronnsen hurried back to notify Arnold. Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greene led the Atom into the house and had her lie down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a luxurious couch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The radiophone on the porch again rang insistently. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the nearest to it, so I answered the call.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is this the residence of Graham Greene?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to speak to Hermann von der Konz."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am he."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am Smith, of United Aircraft. Your absence from</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York has caused us much inconvenience in the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">two days. The Nemesis VI is ready for the many final</seg><seg type="columnLine">tests, and we have only twenty-nine days before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">races. It is essential that you come immediately to New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York and cooperate with our men, according to the terms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your contract. Your delay has set us back, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have to keep you busy from now until after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">races. Come at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smith hung up. I went to New York. I had to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">my contract. It was up to my company's rivals to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">another pilot to take the place of the incomparable Flam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Atom. , Many aspired to such honors, but very few</seg><seg type="columnLine">could qualify. I knew that American Aviation had lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the most nervy and daring flyers in the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps I should have been glad that my only dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">rival could not take part in the race. But I was not glad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the greater part of the United Aircraft people</seg><seg type="columnLine">were. So I went to New York and for three hectic</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks and more buried myself in the mass of work there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be done; detailed tests of every part of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane that was aspiring to break the present record by</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing over the ten-mile course in fifty seconds or less.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was I who was to pilot that man-made meteor, so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sure not to let any detail escape me.

I learned nothing of the success or failure of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cxperimants. He must have been a busy, weary man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the strain of attending to the development of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">artificial man, and his treatment of the Flaming Atom</seg><seg type="columnLine">at one and the same time must have been very great. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not blame him for not answering my calls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three days before the races the Nemesis VI was ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I was advised to rest up. to relax.

He put down the book and smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello.

The shock of the operation was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">great. You do not know?

You're a blue-eyed girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">now!" I said, and it was true. Her eyes had- previously</seg><seg type="columnLine">been brown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Isn't it wonderful ? Arnold here won't let me fly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the races this year though. He's awfully cautious. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">says I'm too weak."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A tall blonde man with an exceptional physique entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room carrying a letter. He handed it to the Flaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atom. She read it and then overwhelmed him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">congratulations. Arnold performed the introduction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is Robert Nelson, the synthetic man," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My mouth fell open from pure amazement. Nelson</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed it and smiled. He repeated my name. "Aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you," he asked, "the man who tried to tell Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greene that I would not possess a soul?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't--I can't understand--you speak English!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Certainement. Mais aussi je parle le meilleur</seg><seg type="columnLine">frangais!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me explain," broke in Arnold, as I hesitated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering if I were the victim of a practical joke. "One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the associates of Graham Greene, the gentleman with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name of Bronnsen, made a particularly careful study</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all the circumstances connected with the abnormally</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast development of that rabbit you saw, and reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conclusion that its growth was only relatively fast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and otherwise quite normal. It was Bronnsen who saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the synthetic man would grow at the same terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate until he reached full physical and mental maturity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So he provided, with exceptional foresight, for the educa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of Nelson by means of the hypnotic machines which</seg><seg type="columnLine">are just now being adopted in the schools. Bronnsen</seg><seg type="columnLine">also was careful to have these machines employed under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the supervision of one of our best modern educators, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have the machines speeded up to a rate corresponding</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the abnormally fast growth. There were'many other</seg><seg type="columnLine">problems, such as feeding, exercise, and so on, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were also solved more or less satisfactorily. Bronnsen</seg><seg type="columnLine">can tell you more about it than I can, for I have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoting all of my time to the restoration of the girl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and Greene's legs. But anyway, it took just nine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen days for Bob Nelson to reach adult manhood, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the growth stopped the same way that an electric light</seg><seg type="columnLine">stops when you snap off the current. Bronnsen says he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is very near to the secret of the rapid growth, but hasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved it yet. I hope he does. It fascinates me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I assure you that Bob Nelson has a soul. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can see for yourself that he has a magnificent body, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will take my word for it that he has a well-trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">and intelligent mind. He speaks two languages and can</seg><seg type="columnLine">136</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">do trig, and calculus, not to mention the fact that he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">become an excellent fancy diver, and if I guess right</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the congrats he has just received from a formerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind racing pilot, he has just qualified to fly the Kani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mura Fensu the day after tomorrow 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bob Nelson smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has," stated the Flaming Atom. "The same re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markable skill that made him an expert fancy diver in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hours has just enabled him to qualify for the races.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I asked American Aviation Company to take him as my</seg><seg type="columnLine">substitute, so they took him in preference to the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">good pilots who had qualified. That's what you call pull,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Von. I warn you, you're going to be flying against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">superman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later that afternoon, after I had watched the syn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thetic man throw a heavy triplane around the atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the skill and nerve of an expert and experienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot, I reached the conclusion that truly I was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">matched against a human flyer, but against an efficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific machine. I often wonder what my reaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been if I had seen into the future and learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was to happen at the race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He, who waAcalled Bob Nelson, was not hindered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the age-old faults and inbred defects of humanity. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was perfection plus, a marvelous machine with a brain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An ordeal that would tire an athlete was nothing to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous body of his. He learned difficult processes</seg><seg type="columnLine">with incredible rapidity. I watched with wondering ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miration that evening when he did a back triple flip from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thirty-foot diving platform and entered the water with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly a splash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Von," I said ruefully to myself, "you can feel your</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed title slipping." And it was so. My confidence was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later that evening Arnold let me see Graham for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short while, though the operation had greatly weakened</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, as the Atom's had weakened her. But my friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a brand-new pair of legs, and he was supremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can see now," he said, "what a great benefit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to humanity my father's process will be. And yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost eleven years ago, when he announced that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could create living beings and living tissues in the labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory, men persecuted him and practically drove him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappear. I often wonder if he's really dead. Eleven</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, without a word from him, the greatest scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world. I shall never begin to approach his ability."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still later that evening I became an unwilling eaves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropper at a conversation that filled me with a vague,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy misgiving, and the memory of which helped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">account for the events that occurred at the race. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper I had wandered into the parlor and had seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself in the big overstuffed chair in the corner, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly picked up the Shakespeare that Arnold had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading earlier in the day. Hardly had I seated myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the Flaming Atom entered at the opposite end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room at one side at precisely the same minute that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob Nelson entered at the other side. The back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big chair was toward them, and I was completely un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed. I didn't pay much attention to them until I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard their conversation. Then curiosity held me, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew that they thought they were alone and I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have left silently by a door near me. I doubt if my</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening in was justified.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Atom," said Bob imploringly, "can't you give me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little hope? You know I love.you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her voice was very serious as she replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think you're foolish, Bob. I'm the only girl you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquainted with, and you think you're in love with me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are many things about the world you have still to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn. There are millions of other girls in the world,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">much more attractive than I am-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There couldn't be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "--and if you knew a few of them you would soon get</seg><seg type="columnLine">over your silly infatuation for me, Bob. You really</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't lived long enough to know what love is. I like</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and admire you, but I loved Graham Greene before</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were ever--created."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were silent for a moment. When the boy re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied there was a' bitterness in his voice that hurt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know. You couldn't love a--synthetic man. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">just an imitation, a scientific experiment. Just a chemi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal reaction. I wish Graham Greene had never-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Please don't. You know it isn't that. You're not an</seg><seg type="columnLine">'imitation.' You're far better than most men could be.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I know that you have honor, Bob. I know you're a</seg><seg type="columnLine">game sport. So I know that you'll realize that I'm en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaged to a man I love, a man who has given me back my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. But I loved him long before that-happened, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to keep on loving him. Realizing that, you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that you mustn't be making love to me. You'll get</seg><seg type="columnLine">over this disappointment, Bob. You'll probably fall in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and out of love several times, and there are lots of lovely</seg><seg type="columnLine">unattached girls in the world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Nelson answered, the bitterness was gone, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its place was taken by something admirable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I beg your pardon, Flaming Atom. I'll never speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the matter again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you, Bob."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Robert Nelson never did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day Graham received a letter from his step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle, Elmer Calvroon. The letter was long, boastful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and threatening, characteristic of the man. Calvroon dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the details of his escape from prison, defied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police to discover his present hiding place, explained that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had altered his features and even his fingerprints until</seg><seg type="columnLine">any positive identification would be impossible, and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded his letter by revealing himself as the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been in the white plane that had caused the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashes at Philadelphia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A voluminous postscript gave many of the details of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his device for projecting a long, narrow beam of intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat, which he said he had invented while carrying on</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiments with the rays above the heat-rays proper but</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the infra-reds. Calvroon's pride in his accomp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lishment was in every word of his description of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. I had previously been acquainted with his boast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulness, so the letter was what I would expect from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. It is hard to adequately describe Calvroon so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can get some understanding of him. Perhaps his</seg><seg type="columnLine">most dominant characteristics were a cold daring or</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve, selfishness, egotism, great scientific ability,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially along mechanical or electrical lines, and an al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most blind determination to get what he wanted, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter who opposed him. So it did not surprise me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Calvroon demanded that Graham turn over to him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'secret of synthetic life immediately. It had been be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of an unsuccessful attempt to kill Greene to obtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that same secret, that Calvroon had been imprisoned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This time, he stated, unless Graham gave it to him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would kill him with that heat ray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had already seen two examples of the effectiveness</seg><seg type="columnLine">SYNTHETIC</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">137</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of that beam of heat. At the Flaming Atom's sugges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, Graham showed the letter to the police and asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for protection. He got it at once. The police were par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly anxious to locate Calvroon because of his jail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking exploit, so that very afternoon a detachment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">police arrived to act as Graham's bodyguard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We never expected that Calvroon would make his</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack on Graham Greene the next day at the races. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all, it was characteristic of his coolness and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">determination that he would take the earliest opportunity</seg><seg type="columnLine">to surprise his victim. He. must have learned about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police guard and decided that Graham was not going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrender that discovery of his father's, even under</seg><seg type="columnLine">threat of death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning of the races was clear and a trifle cold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was hardly any wind at all. Most of us who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been staying at Graham's house went to the race-courses</seg><seg type="columnLine">in south central New Jersey in a luxurious cabin mono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane piloted by the Atom's girl-friend, Joey Vincennes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both the Flaming Atom and Graham Greene were</seg><seg type="columnLine">present, the latter against the advice of Arnold. Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nelson and I were present, conversing pleasantly on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject of plain and fancy diving, though neither of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thinking as much about that, as we were about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten-mile dash. Arnold was present to keep an eye on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greene, and Bronnsen was present to see the artificial</seg><seg type="columnLine">man win the races. Because of the injury to the girl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes which had occupied all of Graham's attention, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the later operation on his own legs, it had been Bronnsen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more than Graham Greene, who was responsible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the magnificent development of the synthetic man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bronnsen was there to see the laboratory product prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">his superiority over a natural man. Bronnsen informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that I didn't have a chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thousands of spectators had come by train, plane, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">car, to see the races. Of course, traffic was jammed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">accidents occurred and both the air and ground police</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a hard time of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> High above, with powerful binocular telescopes, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the various preliminaries; the 'chute-jump ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hibitions, the fireworks display, the sham battle, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunting exhibitions, the various longer races. The fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon passed;: each minute replete with thrills. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time approached for the ten-mile dash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ten-mile dash is the most fascinating of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">events, both to the spectator and to the contestant. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is in the, ten-mile races that the supreme speed-records</seg><seg type="columnLine">are madf and broken. In a longer race, the pilot does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not dare to use the ultimate maximum of speed and power</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his plane, for neither the man nor the plane could</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand up for any period of time longer than a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a half under the terrific acceleration necessary. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the six-hundred and more miles an hour, as you know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the course must be a mathematically straight line, for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot taking a corner even at three hundred goes uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious for a few seconds, and a pilot taking a corner at</seg><seg type="columnLine">four, five, or six hundred miles an hour, in ninety-nine</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases out of a hundred, rapidly becomes a quite dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot. Either he doesn't recover his senses in time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep his plane from crashing or else the turn is too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his brain. In either case he's done for good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joey Vincennes landed the cabin-plane in the space</seg><seg type="columnLine">reserved for contestants, and Bob and I got out and ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gauntlet of television scouts, cameramen, sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">movie makers and snapshot hunters. Side by side were</seg><seg type="columnLine">parked the gleaming little Nemesis VI, blood-red and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">burnished gold, and the Kanimura Fensu, in the milder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tones of gray and green. These two were the only en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trants, each representing one of the two great aircraft</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">manufacturers. Trusted employees, expert mechanics,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were seeing to the last minute detail of the tuning up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the planes. The radio announcer spoke into his micro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">phone, informing all the world that the pilots of the two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">planes were, respectively, Hermann Von der Konz, holder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the present record, flying for United Aircraft, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Robert Nelson, an unknown pilot, flying in the place of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the tremendously popular "Flaming Atom" for American</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Aviation Company. The announcer explained that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Flaming Atom had been put out of the race by an acci-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Of course, none of the thousands upon thousands of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spectators, except that little group in the cabin plane,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had the slightest idea that Bob Nelson was a "synthetic"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man. The world was still in ignorance of the work of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that group of seven scientists, who had followed the di-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rections left by the missing Thornton Greene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In spite of all that the police could do, betting was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">high, and literally millions of dollars, in the aggregate,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were wagered on the outcome of the race. Each year</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that happens. The gambling instinct cannot be stamped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out by law.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It will be impossible for me to describe that race in as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">short a time as it took to fly it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   There was a little delay at the start because of an acci-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dent to one of the six high-speed movie cameras that,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">taking exactly one thousand pictures a second, and per-:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fectly synchronized, were used to record the time of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">race, accurately to the thousandth of a second. Races</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have been won by as close a margin as three one-thou-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sandths of a second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Bob Nelson had never before seen an airplane race,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so he was ignorant of many of the customs and rules of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the game. The officials assumed that he must have been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cognizant of the rules, or he wouldn't be flying, so they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">failed to enlighten him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Literally speaking it is not a race. Each plane flashes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over the course separately, and then the records on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">films are compared. The fastest (or in this particular</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">instance, the faster) plane wins. This was the detail that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the synthetic man didn't know. So when the starter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fired his pistol, as a signal that I could start whenever I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was ready (the plane parked to the left always starts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">first), Bob Nelson, thinking that we were both to fly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">against each other, instead of against time, started too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But I didn't notice him. I was too much occupied by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Nemesis VI. ,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Five miles are allowed to get up speed. That is, we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had five miles to fly before flashing between the first two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pylons that marked the real beginning of the race, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then the ten miles of the race itself to the finish line,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">marked by two other pylons. The time made in those</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">preliminary five miles does not count in the score. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pilot tries to cover them, not any faster than necessary,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but to accelerate up to his absolute maximum speed just</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">before reaching the start, and to keep that maximum</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">, until he has finished the ten miles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In order to be sure, that the course will be a straight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">line, control locks are used. As he passes the start the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pilot pulls down a lever that locks the controlling sur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">faces of his plane immovable, as the pilot could not, at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that terrific speed, keep his plane in a straight line unless</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he possessed superhuman strength. Besides, the control-</seg><seg type="columnLine">138</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lock leaves the pilot's hands free to handle the throttle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crushed against the back of my glass-enclosed cockpit</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the terrific acceleration, I noticed, just after I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached my maximum, flashed between the pylons at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">start, and jerked down the control lock, that close behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">me was the gray-and-green Kanimura Fensu, and it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LOCKED ON A COURSE THAT GRADUALLY APPROACHED MY</seg><seg type="columnLine">OWN.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two planes, each at its maximum speed, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping even with each other, at least as far as could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined by the naked eye. It took very few seconds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at better than six hundred and fifteen miles an hour, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that the two planes were due for a crash, that their</seg><seg type="columnLine">two courses were not parallel, but slanting towards each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. And still they kept even. If either could have in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased its speed by fifty or sixty miles an hour, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was impossible, one could have passed in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, and no wreck would have taken place. But they</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept even.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In order to avoid the crash that would be the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">both planes and both flyers, one of us had to slow down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereby losing the race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a supreme battle of nerve, and it lasted less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than forty-five seconds. When the Kanimura Fensu</seg><seg type="columnLine">was actually within a hundred feet of me, and drawifig</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily nearer every fraction of a second as the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">little planes hurtled over their intersecting courses, I cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throttle of the Nemesis VI to save my skin. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">more important to myself than any race is.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But an airplane has no brakes like an auto, and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">celeration is never quick, I perceived that I had waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole seconds too long. Bob Nelson's plane was per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptibly gaining on me the second I surrendered, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so close to my side that I could see we would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have had several close calls, and I am intensely in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested in remembering and speculating about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidity and clearness of thought in times of danger. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems as if time had slowed down. Each split second is</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear, and action is instantaneous. Hardly three seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">after I had cut the throttle I had seen what was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, and by a combination of reflex and reasoning, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done the only thing that could have saved my life, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob Nelson had held steady on his course at his maxi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mum speed, coolly taking a chance with death. He judged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">correctly too, that I would concede the race to save my</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I saw that further action was necessary, I jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the control lock, kicked the rudder bar violently to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, and jerked back the control in order to send the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane up at a sharp angle, for I knew that I would lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness as I swerved, and I figured that the higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went the farther I would have to fall, the farther I fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greater chance there was that I would come to in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to save myself. At three hundred miles an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unconsciousness is momentary. At a faster turn it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is longer, and too great a speed on a curve will kill the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot. In spite of my deceleration, which had hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lasted three seconds when I made the curve, I was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling at more than five hundred miles an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the Kanimura Fensu, piloted by the synthetic man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed between the finish .pylons to set a new world's</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed record for man-carrying planes, the blood-red and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold rival, Nemesis VI, was reaching the top of its up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward climb. It stalled, hesitated motionless for half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second, snapped back, and dove. It fell crazily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I came to when it was close to the ground, landed it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clumsily, and got out just in time to witness the incident</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that closes this story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   For the dramatic things happened then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   A white electric plane approached at great speed, high</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">above the course. It flipped over on one wing, turned,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dove, and passed over the cabin-plane where the other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">members of our party had been watching the race</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through the binocular telescopes, and as it passed, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beam of heat severed the control wires of the tail sur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">faces. The cabin plane started down in great jerks, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Joey Vincennes tried to maneuver it to the ground in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spite of the useless tail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I do not know what it was that caused Calvroon to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pick that time for his revenge, but I think it was largely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that theatrical love of the dramatic and daring that had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">manifested itself when he had previously tried to kill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Graham Greene; And Calvroon's cold-blooded nerve, to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gether with his conceit and that one-track mind of his,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all combined to cause him to take this apparently foolish</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">method of attacking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But he had a good chance of succeeding. The police</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">planes were all on the ground. If Calvroon got one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">minute's start with that silent electric skyship, the. only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing that could catch him would be one of the racing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">planes, which of course had been stripped to the last</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">superfluous ounce, and carried no arms. They would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be an easy prey for that pencil of heat. I think Calvroon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was perfectly aware that he would be hard to catch and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">harder to capture, or he would hardly have come so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">openly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Revenge must have been a prominent motive. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">previous attempt to kill Graham Greene had been a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">means to an end. This time the young scientist's death</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was an end in itself. Calvroon had always been emotion-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ally repressed, and his hates were intense, whenever they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came to the surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The white plane performed a clever time-saving varia-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion on an Immelmann, and passed over the cabin plane a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">second time. This time the left wing partially crumpled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I think Calvroon must have increased the power of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">instrument since the episode at Philadelphia. The heat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nearly severed the wing entirely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The plane was still under control, of a kind, though it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was side-slipping rapidly. Calvroon turned again to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deliver the final blow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I doubt if you realize the few seconds it took for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing to happen. The populace were watching dazed. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">few of the police had recovered from dieir surprise</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enough to run toward one of their armed planes and start</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to take off. They would have to act quickly, or the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">electric plane would be gone, probably to the east, out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over the ocean, the direction in which it would have a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very good chance of total escape. It had escaped that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">way once before. After all, Calvroon's action wasn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quite so foolish as it appeared at first moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The one who defeated Elmer Calvroon was the syn-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thetic man. Recalling the conversation I had overheard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">. in the laboratory, I think I can understand his motives,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">too. The Flaming Atom was on the cabin plane, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bob Nelson made the sacrifice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   He was still in the air from the race, returning to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">field from which he had taken off.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about time for my vacation; I liked the mountains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and along with the prospect of renewing a friendship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been close once and might be again--together</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a goodly admixture of curiosity--I accepted quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly. I found George seemingly in good health, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderably mellowed in manner and mannerisms by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, and glad to see me. It was obvious, however, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last of his college superficialities had gone; he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very evidently a man whose life had turned inward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridden by some train of thought, whose intensity ren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered ordinary interests only moving shadows to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was much surprised at the magnitude of his power</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant; he had made some arrangement"with a power</seg><seg type="columnLine">company to pass their supply through his turbines and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">down-stream, and had a plant sufficient to supply a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. He was quite alone in the place. After a typical</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain meal cooked by himself, he turned to other</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I brought you here. Bill," said he, "not merely to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">new friendship, but to see my 'trained atom!' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So! Then he had either actually worked out some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing--or was worse in need of a friend than he knew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not feel easy; the expression of his face was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">intense, too absorbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well! That's interesting! Shoot--but load with</seg><seg type="columnLine">words of one syllable!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You need not be quite so solicitous," he smiled, eying</seg><seg type="columnLine">me keenly. "Or, anyway, save some of it for yourself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I may as well go into the matter fully. It was your re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minder of the 'wall of an atom' which started me on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">line--which is one reason you are here. I began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think. The wall of an atom is capable of resisting any</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure short of that found in some of the giant stars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is the kinetic force of the spinning electrons--together</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their magnetic fields, perhaps--which keeps the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nucleus isolated in a sort of vacuum--so far as matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">is concerned. Now the idea which struck me was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose that one could create a sort of super-atom large</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">enough so that one could really 'sit on the nucleus.' One</seg><seg type="columnLine">Could then observe from inside as through a glass wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">untouched by either pressure or vibrations from outside;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whirling electron-shell would form a sort of diving-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell, in which you could descend into molten rock at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">depth without harm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But very simple calculations showed that the forma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of such a super-atom, even if the procedure were</seg><seg type="columnLine">found, would require putting into the electrons more</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy than is found in the whole solar system. Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">could any matter ever get into or out of it, once formed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then it struck me--suppose one could keep an opening in</seg><seg type="columnLine">it? And right along with that, came the idea that if an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening could be maintained, the thing would not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be so large, because some very minute form of observ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing instrument could be inserted inside. This led logi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally to the conception of a cylindrical atom. The or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary atom consists of a series of electrons whirling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbits inclined in numerous directions to one another</seg><seg type="columnLine">around a nucleus built of protons and some electrons for</seg><seg type="columnLine">most elements. The electron-shell is thus spherical. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">why not a cylindrical atom whose electrons would revolve</seg><seg type="columnLine">around a bar nucleus? If one could find some way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">disintegrating matter, the scattered protons and electrons</seg><seg type="columnLine">would instantly seek their affinities, forming new atoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of various kinds. Supposing disintegration possible in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first place, why could not the reaggregation be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolled to form a new sort of atom? I conceived the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea then of applying disintegrative forces to any matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was to be penetrated, meantime supplying a mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">netic field of such nature as to cause each successive</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of electrons and protons to add themselves on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lengthening cylinder already established.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> FROM that point I began to get in earnest; it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I decided to spend all my spare time on intra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic research. From the first the magnitude of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem was manifest. First, disintegration of matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">requires a tremendous input of energy, although the prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticability of doing so within the limitation of available</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy may be admitted. Second, the nature of the tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendously powerful field--magnetic, cohesive, gravita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional, whichever you want to call it--between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nucleus and the electrons, was wholly unknown; is yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">except right here. Its equations had to be discovered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked out, and the means to control it found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The huge size of the necessary atom was another</seg><seg type="columnLine">sticker. At first calculations it appeared that a hal f-inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the bar nucleus and the electron cylinder would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the minimum possible in which power wires and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptive instruments could be inserted. Whether such</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter would be practicable could only be determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">by finding out the underlying laws of atom-formation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of the intra-atomic field. While I was accomplish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a certain amount of progress, there came along Her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">singer's admixture, which, applied to quartz glass, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause a rod of it to crystallize in such a manner that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite image could be transmitted through the rod, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end crystal acting as the receptive lens. Thus one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">See quite clearly around a corner with such a rod; you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will remember that in the 'twenties' quite a bit of prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical use began to be made of the light-transmitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">qualities of quartz glass. So I figured out that if one</seg><seg type="columnLine">could push a cylindrical atom into the earth, keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside of it beside the nucleus an image-transmitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">quartz rod, and another plain rod to carry light down</seg><seg type="columnLine">144</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from the top, one could magnify the image at the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get any information he wanted as to the nature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the material passed--so far as sight goes. I was further</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped by the contemporary discovery in the Universal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laboratories of the new alloy which was given the trade</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of 'conductium'--a substance of such nature that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a microscopic thread will carry electric currents which</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to require heavy copper wires. As you know, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolutionized electrical power transmission.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Putting together a few of my own ideas with every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing developed year by year by twenty or so of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists, who were working along atomic problems, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally discovered what appeared to be the key field-</seg><seg type="columnLine">equation. I knew how to create an atom of any size--</seg><seg type="columnLine">next thing was to do it! The observing apparatus, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found, could be carried down a tube not over an eighth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch in diameter. The size of the power lines of conduc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tium would of course depend on the size of the atom, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as upon the rate at which one expected to disinte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grate matter and add to the length of the cylindrical atom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I figured that about the minimum length of time I wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to spend on reaching the center of the earth--4000 miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">--was five years, or eight hundred miles per year. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures to about two and a fifth miles per day, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would also be slow enough to make full observations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the material passed. Finally I worked out that the ne'ces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary rate of disintegration for a one-eighth inch cylinder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would allow of the transmitting wires to be put in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same size cylinder. Thus the final picture was a cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">an eighth-inch across, revolving around a bar nucleus, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">two conductium threads and two tiny quartz glass rods</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaced around the nucleus. The glass would have to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn by special apparatus at the top and lowered as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the cylinder grew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course, I had no idea of putting into the electrons</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a millionth of the kinetic energy, which they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">contain; it was simply a matter of teasing them into</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving their original orbits and jumping into the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones, retaining all their energy. That was a matter first</seg><seg type="columnLine">of jolting them loose from their original locations and</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnishing a field which would guide them into the new.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The apparatus to supply that field, fed by the conductium</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires, is quite microscopic, very complex, and along lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I couldn't describe, because I couldn't understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">it myself, if I hadn't lived with this problem for five</seg><seg type="columnLine">years."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"TJUT how about the tremendous energy released by</seg><seg type="columnLine">JO breaking up the atoms? I thought it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculated that it would be enough to blow the planet to</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Bosh! Millikan showed as long ago as 1928 that</seg><seg type="columnLine">atom-formation is a power-emitting process; though in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of that a lot of misguided idiots persist in talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about using 'atomic energy.' If you want to get explo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive power out of matter, you will have to do it by mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing atoms, not by breaking them--a very wise provision</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nature against human foolishness; nature having like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise thoughtfully omitted to supply any atom-making</seg><seg type="columnLine">materials. In fact, I have to use a God-awful amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">power at the end of my tube; that increases the kinetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy of the atoms attacked, just enough to spring them</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of their orbits to where they are caught and held by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end-protons of the bar nucleus. The big problem was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to furnish a cylindrical field, the normal atomic field</seg><seg type="columnLine">being spherical.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "So far so good; but when I got to practical applica-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tions I found I'd hardly started. In the first place, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">huge diameter of my cylinder, almost astronomical in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">comparison with a normal atom, made about the same</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">difference in the nature of the field as there is between</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">_ the field of a kid's magnet and the gravitational field of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the sun. Following some preliminary experiments, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had to figure out a new set of field equations, which were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, so far as any previous ideas</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'were concerned. My atom is really a pseudo-atom--a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mechanical device rather than an atomic one. Then the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">effect of the transmitting wires and rods had to be taken</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into consideration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The ordinary atom has no such gadgets between its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nucleus and shell; and I found that condition to be an-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other monkey-wrench in the machinery. Then came the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">question: will an electron-shell, dense enough to stand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">such great pressures, also transmit the light necessary</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for observations? And if it transmitted the light, would it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not also transmit enough heat to destroy the apparatus?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Well, I found that the transmissive qualities could be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">modified by varying the handling of the field; and I ar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rived at a density which would keep out matter, transmit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">light, and keep out dangerous heat. But I also found</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that light transmitted through the inner field of an atom</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is something very different from light through space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">That led to some chemical research and modifications of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the quartz lens. I finally had to run some extra conduc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tium thread through the quartz and introduce an appara-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tus to modify the light rays in order to get a correct pic-'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ture. That was penultimate; the final step was to verify</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the accuracy of the work by pushing the cylinder down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to known strata and examining the transmitted picture</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the rock texture for comparison. After a long</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">struggle I got a true image; and--the probe is ready for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the patient. Want to see?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I did--not unnaturally. We passed through an echo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ingly silent power-house to a small room, doored some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what like a bank vault, with immensely thick walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">George explained that not only was this the case, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that some of his apparatus was mounted on special</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">foundation materials to eliminate earth fremors and vi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brations from the power-house. The center of the room</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was occupied by a large bakelite fitting, into which en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tered three very heavy insulated cables. The inside of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the fitting was so thoroughly boxed off that I.£Ould guess</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nothing of the details.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It isn't an ordinary current that I use--in any sense,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">explained George. "And it isn't used in an ordinary</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">way. To expose any of the carrying fittings to the air</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be dangerous; anyway, I've got uses ahead for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this thing when I get done with the present job, and I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">don't wish to expose it to any unnecessary publicity. See</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">those wires?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Three tiny filaments of conductium dropped from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fitting through a minute hole in the concrete floor, accom-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">panied by thin quartz glass rods; they did not occupy as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much space as an ordinary copper power wire of medium</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">size. I saw nothing peculiar about them, except that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">•	now and then I sensed an evanescent bluish haze which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seemed to surround them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Take a swing at them with this," he said, handing me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a heavy steel bar, "but watch your fingers!" I looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at him questioningly. It seemed like a rather pointless</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">destruction of apparatus which, whether worth anything</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or not, must have taken time and money to produce.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GIMLET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">145</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go ahead!" said George. Moved by curiosity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little imp of destruction which nests in every human</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast, I did so, putting plenty of vinegar into the wallop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I was at it. The bar clanged across the room, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounding from something which gave me the impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">of greater solidity than anything I'd ever encountered;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I nursed my stinging fingers and swore with devotion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while George went off into heartier laughter than I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen him exhibit since his tragedy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was my atom you hit," he elucidated. "My</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, fragile, eighth-inch atom!" I looked at the faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluish glint more in awe than in anger. Of course; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing which figured to stand earth-core pressures would</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly be phased by the application of a mere steel bar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however vigorous. A queer feeling stole over me; it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredibly before my eyes, that George had done the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he had set for himself. I felt like one who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed of seeing a foreign country all his life, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures thereof becoming so flavored with the dream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling, that he cannot immediately sense the reality of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its first-seen shores. The odd, weird foreboding which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">then began to sense, and subsequently never quite lost,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not very rational; but even so, it was but a puny</seg><seg type="columnLine">ptophetic measure of what later came to pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE quartz glass rods extended through and above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fitting, into an apparatus fitted with a large lens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which the light, after passing, was directed at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall, thin ground glass screen about five feet high and six</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches across.-, Back of the lens apparatus stood what</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like an electric furnace, mounted on a standard</seg><seg type="columnLine">in such wise that it could be swung sideways. At one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the glass stood a powerful microscope, likewise</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted, and on tables around the room, was an assort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of gadgets, with some of which I never did get</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly acquainted. They were added to from time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to time during the odd months which followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gosh!" I remarked. "How far have you sent it</seg><seg type="columnLine">down ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only about three hundred feet so far. I just wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make sure it was all right before I got you to watch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">actual tryout. It's like a show---you never can really en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy one alone." The note in his voice on the word</seg><seg type="columnLine">"alone" struck me rather sadly ; a thought passed across</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind that there was a little morbidity here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> George threw a guarded switch, and the air began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hum faintly but pervasively. Upon the ground glass an</seg><seg type="columnLine">image appeared. I stepped curiously around and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spected it. It was the perfect representation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">texture of granite, magnified about two hundred di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ameters. The rods glowed brightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About a foot from the bottom," George explained,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"the receiving lens of the quartz rod is turned toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall of the 'atom.' That gives me an image about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-second of an inch in diameter, which is magnified</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the screen as you see. The great clearness is due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quality of the light, which I am able to transmit</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the other rod. If I want a closer examination, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">just swing the microscope into position to inspect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the screen, and can magnify the rock texture to</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly any size I please. So I not only have a unique '</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme on the whole, but a system for mineralogical ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploration which rather goes beyond anything yet, so far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the microscopic end is concerned. . However, I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">never been able to get a start on bringing actual samples</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the top. Everything inside the 'atom' shell is de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> stroyed during the re-creation process, and I can't get</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything through it afterward--you know that; you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">just tried it!" he grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">■	"I think, though, that microscopic and spectroscopic</seg><seg type="columnLine">examinations will give me everything worth knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">about anything I strike." Ah, how tragically inadequate</seg><seg type="columnLine">did that idea turn out to be!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> George hoisted the apparatus up until the image fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the top of the screen; then pulled another switch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lens traveled rapidly down along with its image</seg><seg type="columnLine">until near the bottom; there was a click, the lens rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">again to the top, minus the quartz glass rods; the furnace</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing swung around, engaged with the lens machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then clicked away again, leaving the rods restored; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lens ran down again. The whole cycle took about</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty seconds for the five feet, or two inches per second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which gave time for a watch on the texture thrown on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen. In case of anything unusual or interesting, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing could be stopped for a detailed examination.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meantime the observer could sit quietly and watch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">business go on automatically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Enthralled, we spent the entire night watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing strata, the tip of the atom by morning being</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly eight thousand feet down, having been in mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">notonous igneous rock for the last two thousand or</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, after passing through numerous interesting but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable stratifications. George then sprung a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. He set in place a compact little movie camera,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted on another of those sliding standards, and elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trically driven. It synchronized with the vertical motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lens, automatically recording the image thrown on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whenever I am away from the apparatus," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I just set this going.

If it should turn out that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed anything special while away, the lens at the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rod could be raised back to that level for closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">examination. Otherwise I would have to hire two</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained observers to help me, or miss about two-thirds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the scenery."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And just what do^ you expect to find on this long</seg><seg type="columnLine">range tour?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I expect to find more or less interesting minerals, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe some valuable geological information, for about</seg><seg type="columnLine">two thousand miles down. After that I am carefully not</seg><seg type="columnLine">expecting anything, because whatever I expect, it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be different." Well; his foresight was good, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">estimate of distance not so good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On this occasion I stayed with him two weeks, during</seg><seg type="columnLine">which time the probe went to about thirty-five miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">without encountering much of great interest except two</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets of white-hot matter. The combination of great</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat and pressure produced some spectroscopic modifica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions which no doubt were very interesting to profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional physicists, but meant little to me. The material</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ordinary molten magma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BACK at njy own business, pondering from time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">to time over what had been accomplished, it dawned</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon me gradually that erratic old George had come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be one of the foremost, if not the foremost, in the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">of science. To say nothing of the wonderful possibili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties in practical application to subsurface exploration, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have mastered not only everything hitherto known</seg><seg type="columnLine">of atomic physics, but about twice as much more. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">146</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I been in his place, I would by this time have been lectur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to vast audiences and organizing mining companies</seg><seg type="columnLine">on an entirely new scale, instead of soberly poking day</seg><seg type="columnLine">by day further into the earth's monotonous, innards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I went on about my business, determining more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more to make real use of George, when he got over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his present experiment. I sounded him out gently on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject once or twice, but got no rise, and decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">let the fever run its course, though keeping in fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">close touch. The atomic drill bit on and on until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second year and the eight hundredth mile were reached.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then things began to liven up. George had been busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of his time digging into new applications of spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">troscopic analysis, that and the microscope being the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">means by which he could penetrate the wall of his "atom,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">which shut him off from contact with the rocks a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dredth of an inch away as effectually as the starry reaches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of space withhold the astronomer from burning his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers on Betelguese. In the course of time he found a</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of measuring not only the heat of the rocks, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pressure on them. Both heat and pressure had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to Hoyle for about five hundred miles, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost incalculable at that depth. One thing he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to find--whether the rock was liquid at such</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths--he had not been able to determine. In fact, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word had no meaning under such pressures and tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peratures. No doubt a fragment of solid suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">transferred from that depth to the surface would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploded instantly into incandescent vapor. But even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glowing materials occasionally found at first, ceased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evidently the atoms of the material down there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">held under such pressure that they could not radiate</seg><seg type="columnLine">light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at five hundred miles the story began to change.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The monotonous character of the rocks altered, giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to metals more and more; the lighter metals, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, came first, then heavier and heavier, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">any definite demarcations. But also about this time both</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature and pressure ceased to follow the old rules</seg><seg type="columnLine">of increase. They began to grow less rapidly.. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">when at nine hundred miles nearly everything had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared except such heavy stuff as platinum, lead, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold, George began to get feverish; and for that matter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so did I. Being his only confidant, he called me in to</seg><seg type="columnLine">check up his analyses, and particularly his calculations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weight of the earth derived from the strata en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countered. This last was positively disquieting. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of rock per cubic inch had increased measurably</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a long time past, owing to the great compression.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The same was true of these metals. But even with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old weights, the mass of the earth figured out to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">many times what any scientist had calcidated it. And it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a cinch that the gold and the rest were not floating on</seg><seg type="columnLine">some lighter metal; if anything, the material would go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on getting heavier. It even appeared reasonable to sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose that there would be just so much gold, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">then we might find some new element much heavier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this point the thing began to haunt me. It was evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent that we were on the track of something which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">upset the science of celestial mechanics in some direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">or other--provided we could get someone to take stock</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough in the stuff to check up on it. Pressure and tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perature increase continued to slack off until the thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand mark was reached. At that point or thereabouts they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were at their maximum but had been nearly there for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time previous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A FEW weeks later I got a hurry call from George.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come quick never mind job going nuts i</seg><seg type="columnLine">think," he wired. I don't know just what I expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find, but anyway, what I did find was startling from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one point of view and prosaic for another. He handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me the reproduction of a spectrum. "Mull over that</seg><seg type="columnLine">while you eat," said he, "and see what you make of it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mull" was the word. The thing didn't resemble any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing I had ever seen; and in the course of my mix-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with George, II had absorbed a lot of spectroscopic lore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">George wouldn't elucidate. He said that he wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see whether I saw the same thing he did; so I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself up against several hours of stiff study,during</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he watched me eagerly, albeit wearily. Finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">there drifted across my mind one of those feelings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">something just beyond the grasp of comprehension. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">groped after it painfully for quite a while, then I too</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw. "But there ain't no such animal!" I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," grinned George, relieved, "since we both see</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, I guess there is; that is, if the calculus of probabilities</seg><seg type="columnLine">still works! I'm beginning to doubt the accuracy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything from mathematics on down 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But an atomic number of seven thousand, three hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred and forty-seven!'' I gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Divide by ninety-three," he smiled, "then see if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks easier!" I did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But that's the atomic number of gold!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't make any sense out of that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, the last time I looked at the screen there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">another on it; try that one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two more hours of labor elapsed, and there lay on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper the mystic number, "7626."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do the same thing to that," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lead!" I gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes! All right; now write your own answer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conundrum!

Now just take your little</seg><seg type="columnLine">pencil and figure the weight of the earth according to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new dope."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I didn't care to just then. The whole thing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting a bit beyond me; I had a feeling of--well, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the supernatural, as though we were pushing beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boundaries of the allowable universe. I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel that I would ever walk on the face of the earth with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sense of familiarity again. What other weird mysteries</seg><seg type="columnLine">did its tame countenance hide? As to the weight--in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim way there crossed my mind the feeling that it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be more than the solar system had been believed to be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly I sat up in more alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•	"Ah," said George ^contentedly; "I see it struck you</seg><seg type="columnLine">too!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean--the drill is now going through a lighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">element ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes--it passed out of gold into hyper-gold; now it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is in hyper-lead, the lighter element."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GIMLET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">147</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just as though it has passed the core of the earth?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A strange medley of half-baked conjectures flocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaotically through my mind. What was that about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Einstein . . . Einstein . . . the curvature of space . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter in space. ... Ah! Now I.had it! The Einstein</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory stated, first, that matter in space brought about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">special curvature; second, that three-dimensional space</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself was curved in a hyper-space. Was it not quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible then, that the presence of such vastly heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance brought about a curvature, which shortened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth's diameter to about half? The idea comforted</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, because solid mathematics seemed able to get some</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp on it. God knows it was weird enough to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a globe with a circumference six times instead of three</seg><seg type="columnLine">times its diameter; but it was better than the formless</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghosts which had begun to troop into my mind from</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer space. If I'd really known Einstein practically,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would not have had even that temporary stabilization.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would to heaven the problem had been so simple!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was rather glad to get away next day and bury</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself in more mundane matters; though obviously</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I had lost in complacency, George had gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the comfort of knowing that someone else saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same things, and that if the thing was a hallucination,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a double one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE story of the next year was a continuance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the experience; element after element was pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated exhibiting the same succession in reverse order,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been encountered on the way down, but all</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing that multiplication of the atomic numbers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface elements. The incredible stupidity into which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange experiences had bludgeoned my brain may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be measured by the fact that I did not realize for a month</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the drill could not be approaching the other surface;</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise the world would be an entity lopsided to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible degree, because of the difference in weight!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the sense of a haunting ghost just beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp of the mind began to disturb me; again and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">an explanation seemed to be at hand, but always mock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly retreated into the shadowy recesses of my cerebrum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broaching this to George, I found that he had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment felt that the explanation lay anywhere in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sane mathematics of Einstein or of anyone else.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had simply ceased to speculate upon any explanation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and concentrated for the sake of sanity on driving his</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine onward with the utmost possible speed, and upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">working out a chemistry and physics for this new world</seg><seg type="columnLine">of matter. From time to time we discussed the possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility of calling in some scientific authorities; but for</seg><seg type="columnLine">various reasons never came to the point. Principally, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think, because we felt an intense desire to have a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted job to present; also partly because, without a sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible explanation, we would never be able to get scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">to investigate far enough to convince themselves that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not all a fake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally the time arrived when premonitions of an ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching surface--by correspondential phenomena--</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to show up. I took leave from my job and stayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with George, both of us practically living on tiptoe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly eating or sleeping enough to keep sane. We no'</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer left the recording of any part of the tale to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic movie, but stood watch and watch, four hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was in the middle of my watch off,-on-one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">those cloudy, lowering, mysterious nights when any-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thing seems possible, that I roused wildly out of a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">lethargy to become conscious of George's frantic grasp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bill, shake out of it! For God's sake make it snappy!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he yelled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yanking a bathrobe around my shoulders, I stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepily and somewhat terrified, to the little room. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that I would have been prepared for anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">except what I saw. Gigantic caverns populated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange monsters; the very flames of Hades, I think,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have been so disconcerting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had some time since rigged a screen covering a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole wall of the room, and introduced much improved</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnifying apparatus, so that the lens could now be</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped down and an image ten feet square thrown. Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">an image now rested on the screen; and if we had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">known that it emanated from some source two thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles below our feet, it would really have seemed quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">prosaic. As it was, its very seeming familiarity produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of its terrifying weirdness. On the screen, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay a starlit nightscape. Under a glare of stars brighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any familiar to us, lit as by moonlight on a moder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately bright night, rolled a sweep of barren land, relieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">by dim, gigantically high, mystically glamorous moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains in the far distance. With a great effort of will, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadied ourselves, took seats and began to try to observe</seg><seg type="columnLine">rationally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The equality of the sky and the light struck us first.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stars were really of the quality of planets--myriads</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. They seemed to swim in some medium, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to be suspended in space. It was as though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole of this strange space possessed a sort of crystalline</seg><seg type="columnLine">viscosity; the stars and the air--if there was air--seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive. But the dim land itself, upon which nothing stirred,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have such aloof, distant remoteness as is felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">in those dreams where one seems to be traversing some</seg><seg type="columnLine">infinite plain all alone in the Universe. It brought with</seg><seg type="columnLine">it terror, the terror of utter loneliness, but mingled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">it a strange, wild attraction; an attraction such as might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be extended by the infinitudes of interstellar space to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one miraculously made free of them. And as we grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmer, and the image remained on the screen without</seg><seg type="columnLine">alteration in any respect, there came a deep, seductive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">insidiously pervasive sense of peace. Not the peace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">temporarily satisfied desire, of ambition achieved, or of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental and physical comfort, but peace such as might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be felt by one forever done with all mortal strivings, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">attuned to changeless infinity and eternity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not such a feeling as I had ever experienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">and imagined; and I felt as though, were I to sit there</seg><seg type="columnLine">much longer, I would be drawn out of all normal experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence and character. Feeling a growing desire to yield</seg><seg type="columnLine">and let that strange enticement take me whither it would,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I jerked myself out of the spell with a strong effort and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to study details again, in an attempt to regain</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scientific attitude of mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OTUDYING the constellations, I saw about the fainter</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ ones a queer familiarity, which puzzled me the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tried to fathom it. Turning to George, I saw him sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting, rapt, with an expression which impressed me eerily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was leaning forward, gazing at the picture as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">his soul were about to climb out of his eyes. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a look of mental and moral hunger about his face which</seg><seg type="columnLine">shocked me, and I realized that the strange attraction</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had shaken off had gone much further with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shook him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">148</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "George!

Yes; there is some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing ... something or other ... by Gosh!" His lethargy</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell off like a cloak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mirror-images!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes.

That mysterious landscape</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay stretched without change above or below, in a star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit night which we now began to recognize was eternal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And with that thought came again that mysterious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrifying seduction of peace, silence, and utter quiet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We busied ourselves with a bit of scientific analysis--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know of nothing which will take the glamor off any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing quicker than that. We ran the drill on for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways, whicli quickly determined that this landscape was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reversed with respect to our own--that its mountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">towered away from our feet. This was evident from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that the point of view rose in the air as the drill</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded; without, however, vouchsafing any more in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation. We continued this until it became evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all we would get would be more of the same, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a progressive dimming due to the growing height above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface.

Comparing our present situation with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any discoverers of the past, it came to me that almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">never had a discovery been accepted, even by the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">open-minded men, unless it in some way were confined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the status of an extension, a modification, or correc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of an idea previously accepted. To present seriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">that which would immediately toss into the discard every</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted basis of scientific thought, except possibly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemistry, and would expose our whole conception of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Universe as being as arrant a dream as the Ptolemaic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">system-! I thought of the years of sweating days</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and studious nights which had now brought me within</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching distance of a real place in my profession; I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of the children and wife, whose future hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">so on my continued advance; I thought of the polite,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-hidden smiles of my colleagues and superiors, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the many courteous but effective ways in which oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity is blocked for anyone suspected of being a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">erratic in the head, and consequently of doubtful re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liability for sober and responsible enterprise. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a bit too much for my courage, and I told George</seg><seg type="columnLine">so; beginning to wonder how many times, in such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricky universe, other bold adventurers like him had</seg><seg type="columnLine">encountered some hinder side of the mask of things;</seg><seg type="columnLine">had so encountered, and, like me, had prudently kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent; or had been foolish enough to speak and in behalf</seg><seg type="columnLine">of accepted sanity had been browbeaten and kicked into</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence, or charitably immured in institutions where their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravings could not flutter the veils of our comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">illusions. And the more I thought, the more determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">I became.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But," said George, "so far as I am concerned, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is more than that in it. Somehow I just don't want that</seg><seg type="columnLine">world discussed; I don't want it--profaned." And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could share with him at least a substantial part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It is strange how adaptable the mind is. Within two</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks, though certainly the mad enigma did'not become</seg><seg type="columnLine">prosaic, we were learning to live with it in some com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">•fort; we at least ceased to let it dash off with our brains</seg><seg type="columnLine">on mad chases which exhausted us and left us at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting point. I left then, and a month later received</seg><seg type="columnLine">by mail the semi-final glimmer of rational light which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ever thrown into that tenebrous universe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The only trace of a path out," wrote George, "is</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GIMLET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">149</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">furnished by Einstein's theory of the curvature of space</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to-the presence of matter in it. If space is capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of curvature, it must lie within a hyperspace; if so it</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be dimensional. Its curvature guides the progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">of heavenly bodies, therefore it must be capable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistance--inertia. And it is not hard to imagine that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in relation to hyperspace it has also mass of some kind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mass, inertia, dimensionality--do not those words spell</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter?

Suppose then that by some in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprehensible means we have penetrated into another</seg><seg type="columnLine">space than ours.

Some letters must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been obliterated for all I could read was a terminating</seg><seg type="columnLine">"ville."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was the most deserted haven into which I had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">taxied. Overcoming a sense of unreality I ran across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tarmac to rattle locked doors and frantically shout</seg><seg type="columnLine">for someone to get me the needed materials. Not a sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life could I raise. At last, concluding some im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant occasion had perhaps called everybody uptown,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I went off at a great heat towards the main thorough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moment my stamping feet left the soft, dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass of the fields for the hard pavement I knew for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainty that something was very wrong. My heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">boots made not a sound. I might have been walking on</seg><seg type="columnLine">cotton wool. For a horrible moment I knew the feelings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a person who learns for the first time he has lost one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his senses. I thought I must have become deaf. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps the sudden change of altitude had brought it on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sometimes I had known a throbbing in my ears from</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a cause. I shook my head until I thought it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">fly off and pounded both sides of my skull like a mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, but still my footsteps were inaudible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Unable, as it were, to believe my ears, I went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">for further signs that would prove my deafness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though I walked the length of the principal street on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the city hall tower rose tall and alone I met only</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring windows, echoless walls and empty sidewalks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Papers swept past me without a rustle. A bird perched</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a telephone wire quivered with a burst of silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">melody. A hungry looking mongrel rushed out to bark</seg><seg type="columnLine">without menace because without sound. I picked up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone and heaved it at him. It hit the asphalt as noise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly as a wind-blown feather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have I gone crazy?" I asked myself. "Or did I</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring down my 'plane in an unexpected crash that sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">me wandering in outer Hades?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Just then, to my inexpressible joy, I sighted a 'plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing overhead; Assured that I was still on earth, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched it fly close only to be plunged into deeper be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilderment. It was accompanied by no familiar throb</seg><seg type="columnLine">'of the engine. Letting out my breath in what should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been a yell, I waved my arms frantically and ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">back toward the airport. My lungs were heaving with</seg><seg type="columnLine">great, noiseless, panting gasps. I never slowed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I came within sight of the open field of the airport</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the blessed spread wings of my own 'plane. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something familiar. If I were in the other world</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had the comfort of knowing my old ship could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">there with me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I flopped down in the shade of a wing with a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaving sigh. As ,1 lay there in its homelike lee it</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly occurred to me that I had heard that sigh. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighed again just to prove it. Sure enough ! Excitedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sat up and shouted, "Whee! Yippee!" like an Ari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zona Indian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">/ I 'HAT yell immediately brought results. The mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment it ceased I saw cautiously advancing around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rudder of my ship the scraped shoes and frayed '</seg><seg type="columnLine">pants of a man who finally peered under the wing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, his little blue eyes squinting and his white bearded</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin working in agitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Are yuh hurt ?" he finally said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No! Just frightened!" I saw no chance of hiding</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact. When I tried to gain my feet, I was so weak</seg><seg type="columnLine">from shock that I sank back upon the ground again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The old fellow stooped and drew himself slowly under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wing on his hands and one hip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the hell of a place!" I blustered to hide niy</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaky voice. "Are you alive or just walking around to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save funeral expenses?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh,. I'm alive," he said, looking at me quizzically,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but I'm the only one in this town who is!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This, uttered in a tone hollow and as if coming from</seg><seg type="columnLine">far away, was enough to add new terror to my already</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken mind.

I asked, wondering where the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's craziness was leading us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I mean without the terrible racket and thunder of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">traffic.

His voice was casual enough but I noticed a pe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culiar twitch of his whole body, as if all his nerves</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly contracted and then relaxed. Whatever terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing had happened, he had evidently trained his mind to</seg><seg type="columnLine">review it dispassionately but his inner self could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained to look back without a quiver. At first I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be unkind to resurrect the past for him, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I was dying to know just what happened. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">it occurred to me that lonely people sometimes find relief</seg><seg type="columnLine">in talking about their troubles, so I led him on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AN you remember," I questioned, "how your</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother overcame his great difficulty in making a</seg><seg type="columnLine">noiseless city?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I can remember that. It appears to me his air</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluid was supposed to kill all sound produced by metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not that produced by the human voice. Yes, I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">all sound is just waves of air. But there are different</seg><seg type="columnLine">qualities of sound, aren't there? Well, this fluid of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">was of such a subtle nature that it neutralized and balked</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the waves which were caused by the ring of metal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At least, that's what he claimed. I saw several demon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strations that seemed to me to prove he had succeeded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why, I saw the demonstration that convinced the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">council that he had a great thing and induced them to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">him try an experiment on the air of the city itself. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can tell you it was a long, hard pull to bring those auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crats of the city hall to that state of mind. But one</seg><seg type="columnLine">day a moving picture magnate came here from Holly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood. He had- read in a scientific journal of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother's invention--one of the scientists at work on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound pictures had seen it. This moving picture man--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I forget his name--offered to move his entire studio</seg><seg type="columnLine">here if the sound-killing device of my brother's proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful. He said that other companies would follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they were sure of finding a place where they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">make sound pictures without the danger of outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound interference. That prospect is what moved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city council to give my brother a trial. They even hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make this a second Hollywood."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How did you go about a demonstration of this sort?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I asked, beginning to see the bearings of his story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With a band and speeches," he smiled down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that funny little white beard of his. "The night my</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother came home and told me the mayor was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">let him try his experiment on the city I didn't sleep a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wink all night. Neither of us did. I was terribly</seg><seg type="columnLine">worried, for I was to operate, the projection machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the roof of the City Hall." He raised a shaky</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger to the one skyscraper outlined against the setting</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun. "On that roof from which the central tower</seg><seg type="columnLine">springs the machine was to be installed. It's the highest</seg><seg type="columnLine">point in the city. I can tell you I was nervous!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why didn't your brother control the machine him-,</seg><seg type="columnLine">self ?" I asked, to draw him from his reverie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He had to be across the street in the City Hall Square</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the rest of the celebrities to see how things turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.

But I was scared</seg><seg type="columnLine">and didn't take in half of what he said. He left and I*</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited for my cue to turn on the substance that was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work miracles. .My cue was the sound of the brass band</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing the 'Star Spangled Banner.' When they got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that part where it says 'bombs bursting in air' . . . you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know . . . well, I was to work the magic. • I was so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous I hardly recognized the tune when it came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in the end I just turned it on any old place in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">music. I did it for him .. . my brother ... I meant only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best for the city ... I turned it on!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What happened?

Seems like folks had the terrified feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that goes with a great calamity and wanted to get clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the buildings . . . out in the open. And they did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst thing they could do. They stampeded toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">City Hall Square. Directly below me they swarmed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great eddying mass, like a silent whirlpool. Two street</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars, not being able to hear warning bells, collided and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a sort of snag in the rushing torrent.

Suddenly he dropped the glass and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke on the stone floor--the second that day. Dizzily</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lurched to his cot. He tossed about on it, but soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dropped off to sleep. When he awoke it was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. The wind was gone and stars were brilliant in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purplish black heavens.

It had been quickly discovered that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere of Mars was insidiously hostile to terres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trial life. In the early days many a colonist had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned, writhing in the throes of a strange madness--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a madness in which they babbled of The Dust--The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dust.

His youth! Why, that was only six months</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago, Earth time. Just six months, and he was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">young. Only twenty-five, but it seemed more. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd give something to be on that Turkish bath of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus right now, or better yet at a certain bend of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandy creek back home in Texas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT occurred to him that in six months his schedule</seg><seg type="columnLine">called for completion of his quota. He pressed one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a row of buttons on his working desk. Hardly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute later a trapdoor opened, and one of the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tian checkers climbed up. He was a youngster himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and patently uneasy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Weight.

Quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creature produced the receipts printed by automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighing machines, giving the total for each day. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines were specially designed to give Earth weights</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Mars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a joyful thrill Farrington read the figures---127</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons. His quota was only 120 tons. On the instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mood changed. He felt again the pressure on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">temples, the burning in his eyes. He saw the interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room through a red haze--red dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why didn't you tell me ?" he roared. He leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the astonished Martian, beat, the unresisting crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture harmlessly upon its leathery, blubber-filled scales.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The protesting, wheedling noises from the diaphragm</seg><seg type="columnLine">only increased his rage. He pounded the vocal appa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratus of the Martian with his fists until the room was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled as by the low booming of thunder. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a sudden the room was alive with Martians. Anx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iously, clumsily they picked the frantic Terrestrial from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his victim and carried the latter to bed. Conscious of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their helpless concern, Farrington was filled with hate</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them, kicked futilely at their ugly, kindly faces. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated them for their ugliness, their low organization. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated them for their rank, oiiy odor. He hated also</seg><seg type="columnLine">those aristocratic ruling Martians, lolling idly in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">polished cities near the canals, living on the work and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brains of ancestors centuries ago dead, condescend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to trade with the young, brash planet to sunward</seg><seg type="columnLine">only for the sake of their palates. He hated their</seg><seg type="columnLine">insolence in refusing direct contact with the Terres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trials, transacting all business through their slaves.

He 'drank greedily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in long, deep draughts. When the glass was empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">he mouthed for more. It was given to him. He lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhausted. Gradually he drifted to sleep. The last</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound he heard was the rustling whispers of his nurses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His last thought was:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's got me!

The natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all gone except Nasa who, mournfully regarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, sat on the floor. His head was reasonably clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, but he dared not move for fear of bringing on an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other fit of rage before he could do what had to be done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He caught Nasa's eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lift me--" he commanded guardedly, "lift me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio!" He shut his eyes again. She lifted him, cot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, set him down before the simple panel of the automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitter. He reached for a central dial, turned it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the call of his operating base in Brazil. Overhead there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a subdued grinding as the astronomically corrected</seg><seg type="columnLine">directional antenna turned to the proper position.

Hello! Hello Rio!" he said in ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversational tones.

You may not need a hemostat, because you're not</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to take that man's appendix out. The shape he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">in I would hardly dare try that even here. All you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to do is to make an incision and put in an inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">drainage tube. Understand that, just put in a drainage</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube to let out the pus, and if you don't get in a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirt, he'll probably recover."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On and on came the matter-of-fact directions. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor took each point separately, painstakingly instruct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Occasionally he paused to give Farrington a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask questions. He told him how/to locate the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot, half-way between the navel and a point on the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hip; told him to shave the drum-tight skin; to wash it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the chlormercoxol, most deadly of all germicides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would even penetrate tissues to destroy lurking</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfriendly organisms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND all that time Steve lay in shallow but persistent</seg><seg type="columnLine">anesthesia. And all that time he babbled of Alfie--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alfreda. He thought she was standing beside him--</seg><seg type="columnLine">denying him--denying him the kiss that he yearned for</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than'all other kisses that were available to a hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some young master of Interplanetary Liners. His hal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucinations shifted to the Caribbean.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was physically tired. He felt a nausea usually asso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciated with space sickness, though the decelerating effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the atomic rockets provided a very acceptable substi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tute for the steadying pull of gravity. If he could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep a little! But there lay his friend, utterly helpless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But was he his friend? He looked at the partly un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothed form narrowly. Certainly a magnificent body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Certainly a handsome head. Wonder if Alfreda thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">so? The pressure of his temples was back. Not so bad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though. He drank deeply, a couple of pints of water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What was that! Not too far? "Be careful not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go too deeply," the ether-borne voice was saying.

"A slip of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife and he's done for!" Farrington battled against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible thought that dogged him. "Just a little slip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knife" and Steve would stop moaning, "Alfie--Alfie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Forward, in their own quarters, were men. Stupid</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brutal, to be sure, except for two busy navigators,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but men. Farrington toyed with the thought of bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one of them up, not to perform the operation, but to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch him--Farrington. He laughed. How could they</seg><seg type="columnLine">know? How could anyone know? Just a little slip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knife; just a little slip, and those restless tossings</seg><seg type="columnLine">would soon be stilled. Besides, it wouldn't do to let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men know the seriousness of the situation. Mutiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">under such conditions was not impossible. The sweep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing voids of space still offered rich possibilities to pirates</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were hearty and bold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't do it!

Farrington cried aloud.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Just one little slip and I'll kill him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " . . . having removed the most of the pus,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on the voice, unperturbed, "notice the color of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intestines.

Her involuntary scream had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been picked up and hurled back at the speed of light, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now re-echoed around the dingy cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jack!" she sobbed.

When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke it was with slow, carefully selected words, beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully pronounced,--as though he were dictating to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stenographer or addressing a gathering of scientists in</seg><seg type="columnLine">London.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the course of my travels," he began, "I have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a great many dead cities, great, ancient cities, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">once swarmed with life. I have spent weeks in places</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Angkor in Cambodia, once the home of a million</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asiatics, but so completely forgotten, that none knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its existence till the Frenchman Mouhot stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it in his quest for Asiatic butterflies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And down in Honduras I have seen the Mayan cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently pass the centuries in the jungles; they thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the green forest the white marbled crests of. their</seg><seg type="columnLine">pyramidal temples. I have lived in those dead cities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">places like Lubaantum and Benque Viejo. In all those-</seg><seg type="columnLine">places I asked myself the same questions: Why did</seg><seg type="columnLine">they die? What killed them? In some places it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though the inhabitants simply decided to migrate. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">why?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 'HE more I asked myself that question, the more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> X puzzled I was. I saw something in Cambodia, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my surprise, I saw the same thing in Central America.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was something that I thought I was sure of but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so fantastic, so utterly weird and impossible, that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could net trust myself to put it into words. I am not</seg><seg type="columnLine">like our friend White. I do not like to be laughed at.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So I kept it to myself. Then, back in dear old England,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I ran across the same thing; and at the same time I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard about the great work that was being done with</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants by an American named White; so, here I am."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What was it you saw in England ?" asked the biologist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It happened when I went down to see my friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin Conway. He had inherited a nice old house and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot of money; so, he made up his mind to restore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place and live there. It was Allington Castle, near Maid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone. It might have been a nice place for him to live in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the ivy made him stop. That entire estate was full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ivy, and on the Castle walls the growth was from six</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ten feet thick and had branches over six inches in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter. It spread all through the woods. It climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the oak trees, one hundred feet into the air, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">literally suffocated them with its dense foliage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The stuff was growing all over the Castle, inside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. Conway put a hundred men to work and it grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster than they could tear it loose and cut it to pieces.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They worked a month, and when they came back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a holiday, it was hard to tell just what they had done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was discouraging, to say the least.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Conway took me over to see a ruined Castle about</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven miles from the one he inherited. This other CaStle</seg><seg type="columnLine">had literally been torn to bits. The ivy had grown over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the masonry, sending its roots into every little crack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then it had grown up to the top of the building, forming</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thick mat over every square foot of the wall. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">it reached the top, it started to pull, and the whole build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing just crumpled, overnight. When we saw it, Ley-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bourne Castle was just a ruin, covered so completely with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ivy that all anyone could see was simply a large mound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of green.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And' what made matters all the worse, it seemed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing else could live where that ivy lived. The woods</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Leybourne, years before, had been filled with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most beautiful wild flowers and shrubs, but they were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">all gone, and the little wild things, like rabbits and birds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all gone too. That gave me room for thought. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">made me see that right in England there might be as</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful things to look into as there were in the Gobi</seg><seg type="columnLine">Desert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because it was not the lack of-money that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conway stop with his plans for the restoration of Alling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton Castle. He had the money and the ambition, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not get the men to work there any more. You see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of them had taken too much liquor, and instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">going back home at the end of the day, they slept there</seg><seg type="columnLine">all night, and when morning came and the Coroner and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jury, why laboring men just did not want to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">there any more, and Conway had to stop. But it made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him mad and he asked me to come down and visit him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went over the entire problem with him, and it suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred to me that perhaps something like that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened at Angkor and down in Honduras. In other</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, the same horrible thought came to me, came back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my consciousness, no matter how hard I tried to ignore</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. I am'an explorer, not an expert on plants, so I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">over here to America to see if White could help me solve</seg><seg type="columnLine">the problem.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Just talking about it makes me tremble. Think of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that! I have, and I say it in explanation and not to boast,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">faced death in a dozen places and in as horrible ways</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as a man can face it, but when I think that there is a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">possibility that my suspicion is true, it makes me tremble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Look at that hand," and he held out his fingers to show</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them a fine tremor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That is all right," said Major Young, in almost a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">soothing manner--- "The braver a man is, the more apt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he is to feel afraid. It is not the feeling but the actions</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that count."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You say that three men were killed?" asked White.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes. I guess you could use that word. At least, they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were dead when morning came."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And they thought the ivy--was that the Coroner's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">verdict?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No. I do not know what he thought; of course he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could not say that--not in so many words. But Conway</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">told me how the bodies looked, and we decided to do a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bit of experimenting. We drove an old cow into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woods where the ivy was the thickest and tied her to a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tree.. Yes, we went in while the sun was shining, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the next day, when we went back, the cow was dead--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and Conway--of course he was not a physician, but he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said that the cow's body looked the same as the bodies</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the three dead men. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This all happened in a poorly settled part of England.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You can drive miles without seeing a cottage, and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">few people who used to live there left, and some of them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a hurry, and none of them talk very much about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">why they left, because they do not like to be laughed at."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Just ivy--just common ivy?" asked White, leaning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">across the table, and pushing aside the plates of food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You mean that it was just the ordinary ivy that grows</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as an ornament on old buildings?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No!" almost shouted Milligan, as he looked point</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blank into the eyes of the biologist. "If it had been,..we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">•would have understood. In the first place, it was big.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Conway and I stumbled over branches that were over a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">foot in diameter, and those branches ran for miles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through what had once been the woods. We never could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be sure just where they started from. Every few feet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the branches sent out lateral rootlets and coiling twining</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE IVY WAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">163</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tendrils, replaced every third leaf, but we never were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sure that we found anything like a central root. We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">did find something, however, that made us think. All</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">these big branches'seemed to come from one place, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we never were able to get within a mile of that place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We located it rather accurately on our map and this is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what we found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Ten years ago there was not a bit of ivy in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods; but there was a large hole in the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest. The maps called it a swamp-hole. It had always</seg><seg type="columnLine">been there; Some of the old men told Conway about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Tradition had it as the home of a large snake. Silly</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea that. Now, here is what happened. I mean to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say this is what I think happened. This new kind of ivy</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to grow out of the swamp-hole. Where did it</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from? Why, out of the hole. And in ten years'</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it had captured seventy square miles of England.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And here is the thing that makes me tremble. Nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows about it, and nobody is doing anything about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conway and I talked about that phase of it; and I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">over here. How about it, White ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT the biologist did not have an opportunity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer the question then, because the Mayor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yeastford suddenly galvanized into life, as he asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Were the leaves a peculiar combination of white and</seg><seg type="columnLine">green? Did those tendrils wave around in the air? Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you think that they sucked the blood out of the cow?--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the three men ? Did you find swamp-holes like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Honduras?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The explorer and the biologist looked at the ex-soldier</seg><seg type="columnLine">in astonishment. At last White asked, "What are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving at, Major?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Simply this. Up in the town, where I am the Mayor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have a hole that we call the swamp-hole. And today</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon a hunter came in and told me his dog had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed down there. But he was drunk; so, I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">credit his story. But he said he saw something like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large vine come out of the hole and strangle the dog.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now do you two men suppose that the same kind of ivy</seg><seg type="columnLine">is right here in America? We have a hole there at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yeastford and something is coming out of it. You said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you never saw the center of this plant, never were</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to come near the real roots of it. Here is your</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. Suppose we go up to my town and go down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hole ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Milligan took another drink and then started to pull</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his pants to the knees, and let down his stockings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look at those legs," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Livid scars encircled his limbs. Ugly ulcers, just heal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, were scattered along the scarlet lines. Milligan</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled as he explained, "I fell down one day. Fortu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nately, Conway was able to stay on his feet, and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ax and cut me loose. I was in bed for days. I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see your little pet vines in that hole in your old home</seg><seg type="columnLine">town, Major, but I want to be very careful about how</seg><seg type="columnLine">I go near them. What do you think about it, Mr. White?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Any connection between Angkor and the English ivy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There may be. The reason for the sudden desertion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those dead cities Hhs been a puzzling one to scientists.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some say it was a change of climate, others diseases,1</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried by insects. Terrible wars might have been at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom. But suppose, just for the sake of argument, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">near each large city there was a swamp-hole and out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this hole came some antediluvian form of plant life?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let us further suppose that this plant life was carnivor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ous. Fear might have then led to the desertion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities and violent, unreasonable panic depopulated them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thousands of centuries ago life on this world was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bizarre, weird and utterly terrible. Everything grew big.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth worms twenty feet long and bats with a wing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread of sixty feet. Ferns grew into trees, two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet high. Animals grew a hundred feet from snout to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail. Then everything changed, and the big things died</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave place to little things and at present man,, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">King of the Earth, is a little soft thing under six feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall. But the dreamers have told us their suspicion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the out-places of the earth, under the ocean or in</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexplored caverns, the giants of antiquity lie, silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping, waiting for the time to come when they can</seg><seg type="columnLine">once again rule as Lords of the Earth. Perhaps in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">centuries of waiting they have developed characteristics</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we have not even considered as possibilities. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">example. Can plants think? Can they plan and act</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to any plan? If they can, and I think that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can show you something very much like it in my plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory, then what is to keep some form of plant life</seg><seg type="columnLine">from deliberately making war on the human race? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made that statement in the reading-room today and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed at me. And I did not know then about Milligan</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his legs. I think that we had better go with Major</seg><seg type="columnLine">Young to Yeastford and see what he has to show us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then--I want to go with Milligan back to England--</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless things start over here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Milligan, the iron man, the dauntless explorer of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waste places of the earth, looked at the biologist as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though fascinated by his remarks. He had often faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger, but it seemed as though he dreaded to face this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. Yet, he forced himself to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is what I thought," he said, "when I studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">those dead cities. Something drove those people out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It came slowly, not like killing waves of animals or</seg><seg type="columnLine">migratory invasions of savage tribes. It came slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the people deserted, while they still had time, and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cities to the vegetable kingdom. Now a few monkeys</seg><seg type="columnLine">sport furtively on the temple roofs of Angkor and a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">parrots scream in Lubaantum, but they are afraid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture too close or too near the ground. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives are afraid; they say the places are populated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">demons, but fn reality they will not be honest with you</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tell you just what it is that they are afraid of. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel that this threat from the ground drove those busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions into an enforced exile, and it was so terrible, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible in its menacing frightfulness, that instinctively</seg><seg type="columnLine">they decided to forget it, to blot the whole episode from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mental pictures of the history of their race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is what I had in mind. And I could not tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone, because I was sure he would laugh at me. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw a starting of it in England, and here in America</seg><seg type="columnLine">I met a man who believes it possible and another man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who says that he knows a place where a swamp-hole is</seg><seg type="columnLine">just beginning to belch forth its guesome cargo. Suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">we go to Yeastford and study that hole? Perhaps then</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will be able to see what can be done."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And it will have to be done secretly and fast, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it attacks our cities as it did in ages past or as it has</seg><seg type="columnLine">that little part of England, then our civilization is</seg><seg type="columnLine">doomed," cried White.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bosh!" cried the Major. "Bosh and fiddle-faddle!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing can destroy us. We are too great, too powerful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too highly intellectual."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Yeastford Real Estate Company had known about</seg><seg type="columnLine">164</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Swamp-Hole when they bought the large area of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">land over in South Yeastford. They had been forced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to buy the hole in order to secure the rest of the land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They knew when they bought it that they would never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be able to sell it. It would never return a dollar of their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I investment to them; so, they simply charged up that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">acreage to profit and loss and added a little extra to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">price of each building lot they sold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THE town grew around the hole. A National High-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">way passed one side of it, a railroad another side,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and two streets the remaining sides. Thus, the hole</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was surrounded on three sides by cement streets and on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the remaining side by the tracks of the D. L. and W. R. R.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A busy, happy and prosperous neighborhood of substan-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tial folks lived there and passed the hole daily. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had become so accustomed to its being there that hardly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">any of them realized its presence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  From the stout fence that surrounded it on all sides</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the land fell rapidly down to a circular center. The pitch</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was so steep that it was difficult to descend to the bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And there was nothing there when the bottom was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reached except a mud hole, ice in winter, dry in summer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and a muddy pond after every hard rain. Trees grew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the steep sides, ferns and moss covered the ground, a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">few pond lilies tried to live in the stagnant water, their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only visitors the myriad mosquitoes, their only friends</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the little frogs who sat shyly on the lily pads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Birds flirted in the tree tops and gorged themselves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the fall on the wild grapes, while below a few rabbits</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and squirrels claimed ownership of the nuts that fell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the walnut and hickory-nut trees. Occasionally a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dog would dash through the underbrush and in the fall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a few hunters tried to kill the rabbits that had the temer-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ity to live so close to civilization. That was the Swamp-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Hole of South Yeastford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The three men arrived at Yeastford about forty-eight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hours after the hunter had lost his dog. They had decided</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that it would be best to keep the real reason for their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">triple visit a secret. So the Major simply told his house-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">keeper, that he had two political friends visiting him, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">asked the inquisitive reporter to say nothing about the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fact that the Mayor was entertaining company. Fortu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nately, the next day was dismally drizzling, making it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">possible for the three to reach the hole unobserved, climb</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over the fence and slide down the steep embankment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">without anyone's being the wiser.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In a few minutes, aided by the force of gravitation,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they reached the mud hole at the bottom. Sure enough,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there was the new growth of ivy and on one side was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the dead fox-hound. He attracted as much attention as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the ivy. The Major poked him with a stick and then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gave his verdict.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Dead as a doornail and dry as a piece of old leather."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Looks like leather and bones to me," observed White.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "All the blood sucked out of him," whispered Milligan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"See those long white tendrils? They have suckers on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them just like those on the arms of an octopus. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">just wrapped around the poor cur and sucked him dry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">See those branches move! I do not know whether you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have noticed it, but since we have been standing here</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there has been a marked movement over in our direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I worked on that point with rabbits for a while and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long tendrils seemed to be able to either see or feel or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">smell flesh. Let me show you. That is why I brought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over this pole and the pound of liver. We will tie the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">liver to the pole and do some experimenting. Suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">we go around on the other side. Those long white arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">are too close to me for comfort. There," and he held</seg><seg type="columnLine">the liver high in the air over a part of the plant, "we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">see how it acts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They did not have to wait long. The plant slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted its stems into the air and surely, with almost an</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncanny, human precision, sent its tentacles towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of liver suspended in the air. As the meat on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the pole was moved, the vine moved, following</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. And at last, moving with a swiftness that surpassed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the agility of the human arms holding the pole; the vine</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped around the piece-of meat and drew it down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle of the leaves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The leaves themselves," commented White, "are re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markably like the ordinary ivy except that they are white</seg><seg type="columnLine">in spots. Were it not for those long tendrils, I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that it was nothing exceptional. Of course, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that it eats meat is not unusual for the vegetable</seg><seg type="columnLine">world--lots of plants eat meat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As far as I can tell," interrupted Milligan, "this is</seg><seg type="columnLine">just the same kind of ivy we saw in England. At least</seg><seg type="columnLine">it looks the same to me; the thing that frightened us was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the largeness of it and the thought of where it was coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from and what would happen if it did not stop coming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course, over there we saw miles and miles of stems,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while here there seem to be just a few yards."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It must have just started here," explained the Major.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Just started. Fortunately, we found it in time. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must think of some way of stopping it--killing it--driv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it back into the hole."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three men made a queer spectacle as they stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in the mist, talking about a danger that no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">else in America realized. They were terribly in earnest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">profoundly impressed with the immensity of the problem;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as they talked, the ivy grew towards them; grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards them, especially Mayor Young, and silently sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thin tendril up his trouser leg and wrapped around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ankle. He turned to go and fell, tripped by the vine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Other tendrils came toward him. White and Milligan</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled at him, took out their pocket knives and started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hack through the restraining bands. It seemed as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">others came faster than they could be destroyed. At last</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Major was free and the three men started to run up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hill as fast as they could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as fast as they went up the hill the ivy came after</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. "Hell!" gasped White, shivering as he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">around for a minute. "It is up with us, and it's not grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. No plant could grow as fast as that! It is coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the hole. Hurry! Horry!!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused on a flat spot, seized a large stone and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled it down the hill. The rock bounded into the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was caught in flight by a dozen tendrils, played with in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air and then tossed aside as though inventoried as</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless. And a minute later the three men reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence, climbed awkwardly over it and stood breathless</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the cement walk. Major Young uncovered his legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked at them. They were bleeding from fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">small wounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as he bent over, a hand tapped his shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You three men are under arrest for trespass," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the policeman. "Can't you see that there is a 'no hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing' sign on that tree?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mayor Young stood erect and eyed the man coolly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I should think you would know me, Thomas?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">barked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE IVY WAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">165</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly he knows you," interrupted another man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">none other than Hiram Jones, President of the Yeastford</seg><seg type="columnLine">Real Estate Company. "Certainly lie knows you, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so do I. You thought you were clever at that last elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. You have tried for years to make a fool out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and now I am going to make one out of you. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">three men are arrested for trespass. Tell your stories to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Magistrate. Go ahead, Thomas. I will make the"</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary charges against them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But my dear man," expostulated Milligan, "you don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't 'dear man' me," shouted Jones. "You talk like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an English actor. I'll teach the three of you to hunt on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my land 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was the ivy we were after," explained White.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's something you ought to know about," added</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milligan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you do not believe me, look at my legs," pleaded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Major.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The three of you are drunk. That is another charge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thomas. Drunk, disorderly and trespass. Run them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night the three men sat comfortably in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bachelor home of the Major. Their experiences had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been decidedly unpleasant. All the political enemies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mayor had delighted in his arrest, and while it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">resulted in nothing, more serious than a fine, which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid at once for the three of them, still, it was a humilia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion which rankled the spirit of the proud ex-soldier.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides, his legs hurt. There must have been a poison</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the tendrils which was infecting the minute wounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sullenly bit on the end of the cigar that he was smok-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The other two watched him closely. At last he</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw the butt into the ash tray and growled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That stuff is growing fast. By morning it will fill</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole damn hole. Perhaps by tomorrow it will start</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cross the fence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are we just going to sit here and do nothing?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">White.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The people ought to be warned of their danger. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">it gets into the road, the little children playing there--</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know what might happen to the little children. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all, Major Young, you are the Mayor of the town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You owe something to your office."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mayor of Yeastford looked sharply at the English-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you think I ought to do?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's wait till morning," urged White. "Then we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can go and see just what the situation is. I guess they</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't arrest us for just walking on the street or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewalk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT is what they did; just waited till morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All during the night the plant came out of the hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all during the night it climbed up the hill and up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees and it grew, as well as crawled. The morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, bright and free from the fog of yestermorn. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, after a leisurely breakfast, walked towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp-hole. Even from a distance they coi^d easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that there was a change iir it. The trees looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger and greener, and as they neared the hole they saw'</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was not a hole any more; there was a large hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">of green ivy with a few dead trees sticking their bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches through the white and green leaves, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole mass was moving with a sickening undulation that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the three observers shudder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were not the only ones watching the hole.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thomas, the policeman, was there, and Hiram Jones and</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a dozen others, and as many women, who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding their children tightly by the hands. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women was talking in a shrill tone to Jones, and holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">her three-year-old child in her arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's dangerous!" she screamed. "You own that land,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you ought to do something. I tell you it was drag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging my child down there when I heard the scream and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran and pulled her loose. I was pealing potatoes and;</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck would have it, I carried the knife with me. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to let that weed grow there and kill our children ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bosh!" sneered Hiram Jones. "It is just ivy. Started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to grow there and the swamp-hole was so rich it grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast. Just ivy, I am telling you. I am going to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuttings of it and selHt for ten cents a cutting. Lots of</seg><seg type="columnLine">folks will buy a fast-growing vine like that for ten cents.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll show you what I think of it. Bah! I'll walk through</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He jumped over the fence and started down the hill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mayor Young called to him to stop, to come back, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he kept on. That is, he kept on for a little while, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he turned around and started to scream. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrill, animal cry, and before it was ended the ivy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him, barring him from the onlookers except for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few undulating movements. Another scream, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ivy started in a hundred pjaces to cross the road.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The folks of South Yeastford shrank back from it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Women grabbed their children and ran trembling to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearby homes, shutting the doors and locking them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thomas walked over to the Mayor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does it mean, Major?" he asked. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt about the fact that he was bothered. "Should</seg><seg type="columnLine">I get some of the boys and go in after him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better not, Thomas. He is going to stay there and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so will anyone else who goes in there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it is just a plant, ain't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, it is just a plant," the Mayor replied, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">absently. "Just a plant. I think they call it ivy, Thomas.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You go around and tell all the women to keep their chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren indoors. Mr. White and Mr. Milligan, suppose we</seg><seg type="columnLine">go back to my home and talk this over. I am sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can do no good by standing here and watching that</seg><seg type="columnLine">damn thing grow. At the rate it is going it will be across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roads by noon, and then--well--we will either have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop it or make the people get out of their homes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In an hour the Courthouse bell called the men of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town to a mass meeting. The bell was used only during</seg><seg type="columnLine">Court week or in case of fire. Naturally the men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the town were curious. The Mayor lost no time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling them the reason back of the meeting. He talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them right from the shoulder; there was no mincing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The men of this town had better get axes and knives</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hatchets and start fighting," he ended. "Otherwise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people in South Yeastford will be driven from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">homes in a few days. And they had better leave if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ivy comes near them. I am going to leave this in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of the Councilmen, and I and my guests- are going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the Governor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, there was endless talk. Everyone knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Mayor had been fined the day before for dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orderly conduct. Perhaps he was still drunk. Still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the men who attended the meeting left it to walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to South Yeastford. What they saw there was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">166</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">especially assuring. The ivy was now over the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">and starting to grow over the lawns on the other side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An automobile had been driven over that street, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been caught by the ivy, and the man driving it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely escaped with his life. It did not take the curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectators long to realize that they had to start in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get busy. They did so, but without discipline or order,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each man for himself and in any way and place that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to. They worked all the rest of that day, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then,- rather satisfied with clearing the street, they went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their homes for the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning the ivy had recrossed the street and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was curling around some of the houses. By that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the State Constabulary, under orders from the Governor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived and took charge of the work. It was rumored</seg><seg type="columnLine">that several regiments of State Militia had been ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">but. Eager newspaper reporters began to interrogate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the town people. Thomas, the policeman, was in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glory. He was especially clever in describing how Hiram</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith had yelled as the ivy dragged him under.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is an interesting fact that the Governor gave one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred percent credit, to the story told him by the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitors from Yeastford. Major Young, White and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milligan had been able to show him that a very real</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger existed in his state of Pennsylvania. He promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mayor all the help that the state machinery could</seg><seg type="columnLine">afford. He even offered to come to Yeastford himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as he could do so. .After the conference, he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long interview to the newspapers, in which he spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">much about himself and little about his three visitors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One would judge, from reading the article, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Governor had been the first one to discover the ivy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to recognize its danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">' On the fifth day two regiments of National Guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">and over a thousand citizens were actively fighting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing ivy. The men were working in relays. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">work was being performed in an orderly and systematic</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner. With the greatest difficulty, the roads were kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear and the ivy was confined to the swamp-hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fight to keep the ivy inside the fence was appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently a fairly easy one. Every night the ivy grew, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every day the branches that went over the fence were cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. Of course, it took till nearly dark to finish ths</seg><seg type="columnLine">day's work, but when darkness came the road and side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walks were cleared of the vegetating threat. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">some casualties, but the offensive powers of the plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be considerably diminished by the multiple</seg><seg type="columnLine">traumatisms that it was suffering. It looked like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy victory. Even Milligan, with his superior knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge, was hopeful of success. On the second day White</seg><seg type="columnLine">had returned to New York for further study of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant in his laboratory. He did not return till the sixth</seg><seg type="columnLine">day of the fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the train from New York he thought over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation. As the train neared the Water Gap he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on the rear platform. The Gap was passed and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pulp-mill and the track began to parallel Broadhead's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Creek. There, above the power dam, he saw something</seg><seg type="columnLine">that made him turn white. He was still swearing when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he jumped off the train at East Yeastford. Milligan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had received the wire announcing his return, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonished to see the usually placid biologist so upset.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Milligan, what have those fools been doing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They have been cutting off that ivy. What did they</seg><seg type="columnLine">do with the pieces?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "They must have carted them away. I know. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">took them in carts and dumped them into the creek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Some they took up on Fox Hill."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "They were fools and so were we. They should have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been warned. Fire! That was what was needed! Fire!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps it is too late now. Every piece that had an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aerial rootlet and had a chance has started to grow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Broadhead's Creek is full of it. It is starting to run up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into the mountains around the Gap. Unless we act at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">once we are lost."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "But I do not understand," cried Milligan. "I thought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it all came from a central plant of some kind, a variety</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of plant animal that lived in the hole. Don't the pieces</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">die when cut off, as my fingers would if they were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">amputated ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No! That is going to be the trouble of it for this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">country. I have been working with it. Even the smallest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">piece, if it can obtain water, will start growing and make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a new 'animal.' I wish I could escape from the word</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'animal,' but I cannot. The 'thing' seems to have every-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing that we have in the way of vital systems, and I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">think that it has some kind of a mind. It can think.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">All that it has lacked so far is mobility. It seems to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be attached to a central root and it just moves forward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and grows as it moves, but the main body stays in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hole. That was the impression I obtained from what you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">told me, Milligan, and even in England, where no one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fought it, it took a long time for it to cover just a small</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">area. Here is a different story. We have been helping</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it. We threw hundreds of pieces into water and that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">water carried it down for miles. Perhaps some branches</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are drifting to Philadelphia at this minute. I am sure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the whole Gap area is infested."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After that, fire was added to the weapons used. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seemed to work for a while, at least around South Yeast-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ford. But in the woods of the Water,Gap it was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">different story. There the forests were filled with small</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">summer cottages and large hotels. There was a great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">investment. Fire in the woods meant burning buildings*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The hotel owners started legal proceedings. There were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">injunctions and counter-injunctions. It all meant delay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">EVEN at that time America was not air-minded. Had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she been, the use of bombing airplanes would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have been thought of at once. As it was, over two weeks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">passed before it occurred to anyone to try the extermina-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion of the central plant-animal by bombing from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Once thought of, everyone wondered why it had not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been used the first day. Ton after ton of T.N.T. were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dropped into the Swamp-Hole. The town of Yeastford</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was shaken by the explosions. Windows were shattered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When the attack ended, the hole was just a mass of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pulverized rock and shattered trees. There was nothing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">green left. The victory was so easy that the authorities</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wondered at their fright of the past weeks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Yeastford seemed safe. If the Water Gap was in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trouble, it was their own fault. The Governor of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">State turned the matter oyer to a special committee and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">t started to build his fences for the next election. Up on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the barren mountains of the Gap the ivy seemed to lose</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">its terror. People simply learned to stay away from it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Meanwhile it was growing in the Delaware river. In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this period of the war the attacking animal showed its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">diabolic cleverness. Of course, it was a thousand sepa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rate animals under the river, but each one, originating</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE IVY WAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">167</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from the same parent stem, seemed to partake of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">original central nervous system, and one of the remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able points in the entire Ivy War--for so it was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">termed in the histories of the future--was the ability of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the plants to work in perfect synchronized harmony</seg><seg type="columnLine">with each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plants grew down the river. Biologists later on</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated that the original home was in deep subterranean</seg><seg type="columnLine">lakes, where it lived the part of an aquatic animal. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly showed its ability to live under the waters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Delaware. It gave no evidence of its existence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not a leaf appeared above the surface of the water. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply stretched its long branches southward along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed of the river, and as those branches grew into long</seg><seg type="columnLine">submarine cables, they grew thicker until many of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were over a foot in diameter and looked like large water</seg><seg type="columnLine">snakes, as their whitish brown sides appeared through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boiling waters of the occasional rapids.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The branches grew down the river till Philadelphia</seg><seg type="columnLine">was reached. Once more the combined intelligence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plant-animal showed itself in not making an imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diate attack. With flame, dynamite and ax, regiments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men were fighting the menace on the slopes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains around the Delaware Water Gap. But no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thought of searching the Delaware River between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philadelphia and Camden; and had anyone thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, it would have been difficult, almost impossible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">exterminate a mass "of tangled roots stretching for miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the river front and thirty feet deep in the channel</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud. Meantime the stranger was growing, gathering</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength, preparing for the conquest of the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In spite of the many conjectures and surmises, no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever determined positively whether the ivy had a language</seg><seg type="columnLine">or some method of communicating with its various parts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One thing is certain and that is the fact that during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole war it showed the intelligence of a thinking unit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life. For example, instead of concentrating its forces</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a small town, it deliberately passed Portland, Easton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trenton, and waited till it reached one of the great cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the East, Philadelphia. Once there, it did not send a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single attacking branch to the east side of the river, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Camden, but put all its energy into the conquest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The time that it selected for the attack was opportune.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a night in early spring, cold and damp with fog.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No one was out on the street, save from necessity. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">street lights gloomed like sullen stars overhead. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet streets and the moist air served as a blanket to</seg><seg type="columnLine">deaden every sound. Then, at midnight, when every</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchman was hunting the warmth and dryness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter, the plant sprang forward to the attack. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant, perhaps, but with a thousand parts; one animal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might easily be, but with a thousand arms; one intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lect, but with a thousand deadly attributes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up Market, Walnut, Arch and many streets running</seg><seg type="columnLine">west from the river the plant advanced to the attack. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was silent in its growth, murderous in its desires.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Watchman after watchman died with the horrid coil</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his neck, giving, through a hundred punctuate</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounds, his life fluid to feed the plant and passing out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of consciousness without the least idea of what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">killing him. Into the cellars, the bootlegger's joints,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cheap boarding and rooming houses, the laterals</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread and collected therein their harvest of death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as the "animal" tasted more and more blood it</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked faster, gathering its harvest of death. It worked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">faster and even more silently. The city east of Broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street was surrendering to the enemy without even</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing that there had been a battle waged. Aerial</seg><seg type="columnLine">rootlets fastened to the stone buildings, and up these</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings the terminals grew, searching for their prey</seg><seg type="columnLine">through every open window, every unlocked door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morning came, a lovely spring morning. Before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kisses of the sunbeams the mist melted in gentle resig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation. The city awoke, feeling that it was good to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive, and not till then, when the first living people started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to invade the district east of Broad Street, did the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the nation realize what had happened during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent watches of the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those in that portion of the city who had escaped death</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the dark hours gayly walked out into the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">without the least intimation that anything was wrong, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">once there, died quickly. And whether they died quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">or with screams made no difference to the "animal" that</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed around them and sucked out their fluids.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even in the daylight it took the forces of Philadelphia</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time to realize what had happened and was happen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to them. It was not till nine in the morning that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scientists suddenly appreciated the fact that the ivy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Yeastford, the plant that was still being fought on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains of the Water Gap had in some peculiar way</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached Philadelphia and was taking the city by storm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was something greater than the business of a city</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the affairs of a state. This was something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">menaced the life of the nation. If an unsuccessful fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">were made against the plant in Philadelphia, what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hinder it from attacking other cities? Wilmington?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baltimore? and even Washington?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The defense was slow in starting because it could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, at first, nothing but the advanced portion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy. It was plain to be seen that Market, Chestnut,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arch and Walnut Street? were slowly filling with a mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of green leaves, but it was not until daring aviators had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made an aerial survey of the situation that the defenders</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized the important fact that the attack had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">inaugurated from the river. Later on, when ship after</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship had been surrounded, pulled down into the river mud</seg><seg type="columnLine">and everyone of the crew killed, the real significance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this became apparent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ivy grew upward as well as onward. Front Street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">within twenty-four hours, was a mass of green embow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered houses, and some of the older ones were already</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to be pulled to pieces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Governor of the State heard the news and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">recalled the three men from Yeastford. He lost no time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in trying to get in touch with them over the long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance telephone. Here more time was lost. The Mayor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone to New York for a rest. White was working</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his laboratory, trying to find some method of fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ivy. Milligan had strangely disappeared. Unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">locate any of the three, the Governor was momentarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a loss as to what to do next. In despair he sent .the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire National Guard of the State to Philadelphia, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the command of the Adjutant General of the State, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went to State College to talk matters over with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dean of the Agricultural Department. To his surprise he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that gentleman had left for New York. Not till</seg><seg type="columnLine">later did he realize that the Dean had gone to White</seg><seg type="columnLine">for help as soon as he had heard of the trouble, realizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that White, of all men, was the one most likely to be of</seg><seg type="columnLine">real assistance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">168</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first day and the next the same tactics were</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed in fighting the ivy; that is, that had been used</seg><seg type="columnLine">in South Yeastford. The effort was made to keep it east</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Broad Street. The terminal branches were cut off as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they tried to cross the dead line.. As company after</seg><seg type="columnLine">company of the guards derailed they were marched to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fighting line and put 011 sentry duty. No one was</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed to even try to enter the doomed area. Death, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time omnipresent, kept anyone from leaving. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">though satisfied with its day's work the ivy stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">going westward, and seemed satisfied to solidify its</seg><seg type="columnLine">position in the east of the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had captured the subways, putting an end to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel there. The defense had an idea that it was work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing silently through the sewers of the city, but the danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so new, the problem so intense that 110 one had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage to speak openly about what might be going on</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the city.- The end of the second day came, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broad Street clear and a strange battle going on between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the military and financial forces of the city. The air</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces were anxious to drop depth-bombs into the Dela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ware River, to try and blow the enemy to bits at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">headquarters. They wanted to throw T.N.T. into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great green masses on Market and Arch Streets. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were anxious to start a war to the death. And the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">interests, the financiers who had their millions invested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">real estate _and stores of precious goods east of Broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street protested. They appealed to the Governor, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried to the President, they even sent messages to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Allwise demanding less harsh measures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime, the ivy rested. At least, it seemed to rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What it really did was to send a hundred roots up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schuylkill River and on the third nighfinvade the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the west. The dawn broke with every bridge, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad track covered with ivy and evidences of having</seg><seg type="columnLine">been rather rapidly pulled to pieces. The Pennsylvania,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the B. and O., the Reading were all forced to suspend</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation. The city could no longer be fed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Conferences began. Interviews were given. Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">personalities ventured asinine opinions. Every Tom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick and Harry, who was able to do so, rushed into print.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were a thousand remedies offered, none of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be of any possible use. The Red Cross, the Regu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar Army, the Grand Old Party and the Amalgamated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Labor Unions each started in to do their bit. But every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was working in a different way to accomplish the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same thing, and no one was quite sure of just what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">really wanted to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime the plant was growing, the "animal" was</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming more powerful. It was gradually gathering in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its forces on every side of the city. The citizens started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave; there was little suffering, and after the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, there were practically no deaths, but the President's</seg><seg type="columnLine">advisers realized that a panic would start just as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city dwellers knew the possibility of their being</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely surrounded. So, they silently encouraged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depopulation of the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the national danger was so plainly seen, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders were given to bomb the rivers and the city east of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broad Street. That order would have been carried out</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not White arrived in Philadelphia and asked for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">delay. He made a peculiar figure before the important</seg><seg type="columnLine">personages gathered at Army Headquarters in City Hall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was rather cheaply dressed, was without a hat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried a Boston bag in one hand a gallon demijohn</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the other. It took a good deal of introducing to make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Generals realize that the man before them was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading expert in plant physiology in the Western Hemi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T? VER since this ivy war started in the swamp-hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">XL in South Yeastford," he began, "I have been trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to devise some scientific method of fighting it. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the uselessness, the utter hopelessness of making a</seg><seg type="columnLine">frontal attack on it in force. We were able in Monroe</seg><seg type="columnLine">County to cut it to pieces, but each little piece simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">started in to make a new plant with all the devilish brains</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mother 'animal.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I started to study this peculiar form of ivy. I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it had a nervous system and through this nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">system it was able to communicate with its various parts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, most important of all, was the discovery that it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a circulation that was rather like that of the fetal cardio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vascular system. It actually pumps fluid from one end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its body to the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Before 1 arrived at this conclusion, the scientists who</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied plants were at a loss to explain the movement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sap in the larger forms of vegetative life. Atmospheric</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure would only raise the sap thirty-four feet, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of the water barometer. Osmotic pressure might</seg><seg type="columnLine">play a part,'but it is so slow that in the giant Eucalyptus</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amygdalina it would take a year of osmotic pressure to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take sap to the top, four hundred and fifty feet above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. Nothing explained this movement of sap</seg><seg type="columnLine">till I found in; this ivy a propulsive tissue very much like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart muscle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Once I found that, I realized that the ivy had a cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culation in two directions. Much of the time I have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering whether I was working with an animal or</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a plant, but that does not make any difference,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because I have found the thing to kill it with."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, what is it?" yelled an irritated General.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Simply this," and White held up the gallon demijohn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is the stuff that will do the work. But I ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you that I think this ivy is more of an animal than</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is a plant. At least its sap has cells in it, different</seg><seg type="columnLine">from our red corpuscles, yet, at the same time, a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">like them. When I found that out I started to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">haemolytic toxin, something that would have the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect on the sap of the ivy that poison of the cobra</seg><seg type="columnLine">serpent has on the blood of man. It was not very easy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I found it, and for the last three days Milligan and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been over in Wolf Hollow north of the Gap, experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menting with it. And I tell you one thing: it kills the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ivy and it kills it quickly. Inject it into this blood stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the terminal end of the animal and it travels back</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the animal-plant like fire and literally kills as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">travels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You give me a company of soldiers to help me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milligan and I.will liberate this city in a few days, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I am going to advise the President to start a war of</seg><seg type="columnLine">extermination against every ivy in this country, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter how harmless and innocent it may seem."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the Generals turned to another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it worth trying?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think so," was the reply. "We will wait twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">'four hours and at the end of that time if there are no</seg><seg type="columnLine">results, we will start the bombing planes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Half an hour later a peculiar event was taking place at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broad and Market Streets, on the northwest corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wanamaker's store. A company of soldiers had isolated</seg><seg type="columnLine">a branch of the ivy, had cut off all the tendrils and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE IVY WAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">169</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled it out till it lay like a writhing snake, its end almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching City Hall. It twisted and pulled and squirmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and almost got away from the hundred men holding it</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast. Sitting on it was White, With Milligan helping</seg><seg type="columnLine">him fill a 25 c.c. glass septic hypodermic syringe. At last</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was filled and the three-inch hollow needle was plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the bark of the ivy, the toxin being slowly injected</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the circulatory vessels. Instantly the leafless branch</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped to the pavement. Back of its attachment to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">store the green leaves were turning brown, the waving</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendrils, seeking in everlasting motion their human food,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped uncoiled and lifeless. A thick swarth of green</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased moving and hung dead on the side of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">emporium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Walking a hundred feet across Market, White picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out another branch for attack. The same procedure</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought the same results. Ten doses were given and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then twenty. The aviators reported that long streaks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown were appearing among the green and that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaks were going back to the river. White asked for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few physiologists, whom he could train to give the injec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. The men whom he wanted appeared as though by</seg><seg type="columnLine">magic. Milligan directed the work while White went</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to New York for a larger supply of the haemolytic</seg><seg type="columnLine">poison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now that a means of defense was assured and a defi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nite program arrived at, everybody worked in harmony.</seg><seg type="columnLine">System grew out of chaos. Hope took the place of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom. The nation, interested at last, financed the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the war. White was made a General, Milligan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">decorated, and Major Young, promoted to a Colonelcy,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was placed in charge of the Monroe County portion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The war ended with the same rapidity with which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had begun. From the first the living organisms must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have realized the hopelessness of the struggle, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">they made a definite and orderly retreat. Tearing off</seg><seg type="columnLine">their branches, they withdrew to their place of security</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the rivers, and even there, realizing that they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be hunted for with grappling hooks, fled hastily to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nation, aroused to the peril, conducted a systematic</seg><seg type="columnLine">campaign of extermination.

That man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Theodore Gilcrest by name, was director</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the zoological gardens recently estab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lished at Washington under governmental</seg><seg type="columnLine">auspices. Had he confined himself to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">duties as director, there would have been no</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason to pen these words, and the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been spared incalculable suffering; but, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have come to learn, he had a penchant for scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimentation, and his position at the head of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">zoological gardens offered him an opportunity to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dulge his lifelong hobby. It was not generally known at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time that he was conducting researches at the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pense of his four-footed and winged charges; and, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">this fact been revealed, his dismissal would probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">have followed. But for several years, in a private</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory adjoining the zoological grounds, he was wont</seg><seg type="columnLine">to experiment upon an occasional wolf cub, or antelope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or serpent, as well as upon plants of various kinds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon large numbers of cats, dogs, and insects. It must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be said for him, however, that while his use of govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment property was unlicensed, the purpose that actuated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">170</seg><seg type="columnLine">By Stanton A.

For he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a scientist, conducting his investigations in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of thousands of his kindred, although with</seg><seg type="columnLine">more brilliance and ingenuity than the majority; and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pursuing the scent of what promised to be a world-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving discovery. He had ferreted out, in a word,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secret of a biological alchemy; he had solved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem of the artificial mutation of species. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could produce at will new varieties, even new genera and</seg><seg type="columnLine">families of animals and plants!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unfortunately, it is impossible, at this late date, to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribe precisely how Gilcrest achieved his extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">result; for the inventor, horrified at the eventual out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come of his discovery, has destroyed the formula and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so precluded for all time the repetition of his experiment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But this much is known: he operated by means of a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-regulating machine, akin to the X-ray, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">different from it in several essentials; and he availed him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self of those parts of the spectrum invisible to the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">yision. Opinion is divided as to whether he made use</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ultra-violet or of the infra-red rays, and he him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self has resolutely refused to break silence on the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject ; but what he does acknowledge, since this admission</seg><seg type="columnLine">can furnish no vital clue, is that he applied the rays for</seg><seg type="columnLine">definitely regulated periods to the reproductive organs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and germinal cells of animals, and to the seeds, spores</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pollen of plants, thereby producing a chemical</seg><seg type="columnLine">change that operated in some obscure way to transform '</seg><seg type="columnLine">species. Gilcrest himself was never-able to foresee</seg><seg type="columnLine">just what direction that change was to take, and could</seg><seg type="columnLine">only surmise that he had modified the life-bearing cells</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some essential, creating in a few minutes the effect</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of hundreds or even thousands of generations of evolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. But while the alterations appeared to follow no</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular law, they were governed in one respect by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rude uniformity : they worked by a rule of opposites, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in most cases the transformed species assumed qualities</seg><seg type="columnLine">as unlike their former selves as fire is unlike frost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One would haye been sufficiently aware of this fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">had one visited Gilcrest's laboratories before the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aster, and observed the army of freaks, monstrosities and</seg><seg type="columnLine">living contradictions that they contained. But nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">all those freaks and monstrosities have since made them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves only too familiar to the world--so that it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointless to describe them at this place. It will be neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary to remark, however, that Gilcrest wished his new</seg><seg type="columnLine">species to prove of genuine value to mankind, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had found encouragement in the fact that they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">breed true to type, thereby giving hope of their indefinite</seg><seg type="columnLine">perpetuation. . . . And the great biologist's expectations</seg><seg type="columnLine">might indeed have found justification, had it not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the catastrophe that frustrated his years of effort in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hour and flung open a Pandora's box upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilcrest has never been-able satisfactorily to explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire that attacked his laboratory late one night--</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether it was due to lightning, or to incendiaries, or to</seg><seg type="columnLine">an electrical short-circuit; or whether one of the trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed monkeys, finding a box of matches carelessly left</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a laboratory table, had let havoc loose upon himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his fellows. Gilcrest himself is inclined to favor the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter explanation; but, whether or not he be correct in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, the fact is that he was awakened one night with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooty odor in his nostrils and with the red flare.of fire be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore his eyes. And, to his consternation, he discovered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">171</seg><seg type="columnLine">172</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that his laboratory, which lay just behind his house, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scene of spouting smoke and flame. Not more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">half awake, he gave the alarm and aroused the household;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, long before the arrival of the firemen, dashed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory door, and fighting his way through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangling fumes, flung open cage after cage, setting free</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screeching, screaming occupants. Behind him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the flapping of panic-stricken wings, the rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of panic-stricken legs, as the released birds and beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">made for the doorway and vanished. Yet never for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, in his excitement and alarm, did he reflect as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the folly of letting these creatures loose upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wo^ld; maddened at the thought of their peril, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked in reckless disregard of his own safety, until,</seg><seg type="columnLine">assisted by neighbors and firemen, he had rescued most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the animals, as well as a considerable number of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants that grew about the windows in flower-pots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And when at last, scorched and half suffocated, he extri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated himself from the ruins, it was in a state of torment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nervous collapse that was to confine him to his bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a month. . . . None the less, between delirious rav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings and mutterings, he was heard to rejoice that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">creations had been spared. Little did he suspect what a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plague he had bequeathed to mankind!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A day or two later, the earliest signs of trouble began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be reported. A Maryland farmer, waving a stick at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a creature that he mistook for a crow, was terror-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken to find the bird attacking him and lacerating</seg><seg type="columnLine">him about the hands and face. Simultaneously, a farmer</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Delaware, about to shoot a chicken hawk, was dumb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">founded to hear the supposed marauder bursting into</seg><seg type="columnLine">song, which he declared to compare favorably with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the field lark. Of course, neither report was believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first--yet both were mild enough by comparison with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that which lay in store. It was in the city of Washing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton that the first pronounced symptoms were observed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the manner of their appearance was such that denial</seg><seg type="columnLine">was impossible. Not one citizen, but a thousand, paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">in astonishment to watch the little dog equipped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">claws that enabled it to climb trees like a squirrel; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">another thousand, at the lowest estimate, listened to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">squirrel with a transformed larynx that permitted it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bark like a dog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These, however, were the least of the new-born</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonders. Others were more alarming by far. In cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain sections of the city, a panic was caused by the an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nouncement that several cats, reverting to ancestral</seg><seg type="columnLine">habits, had become beasts of prey, at war with all human</seg><seg type="columnLine">society; and no one could explain why it was that a score</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lonely pedestrians, mostly women and children, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been pounced upon at night and dangerously slashed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood-thirsty brutes. Still more difficult to account</seg><seg type="columnLine">for was the fact that rabbit-like creatures had been seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">--surely, not actually rabbits!--which had forgotten the</seg><seg type="columnLine">traditional timidity of their kind, and had no hesitation</seg><seg type="columnLine">about approaching and biting unwary passers-by. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">most horrible of all was the discovery that venomous ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pents were wriggling about among the lawns of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Capitol grounds--serpents of an extraordinary kind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with monstrously overdeveloped heads and poison-sacs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">combined with a swiftness of motion and a sagacity that '</seg><seg type="columnLine">made them almost impossible to slay. Only after one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these reptiles had had the poor judgment to sink its</seg><seg type="columnLine">fangs into the calf of a United States Senator, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the Mistress of the White House execute a scream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing retreat, did men in general recognize the seriousness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But much more frightening manifestations soon began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to appear. One of the most disquieting of all was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect menace. Shall any of us ever forget the terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the summer of 1964, when a new species of house-fly</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended upon us, equipped with a blood-sucking para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phernalia that the mosquito might have envied? Shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">we forget how our days were passed in torment, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">how we could scarcely venture out of doors without be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing attacked by swarms of these little savages, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferocity was equalled only by their fecundity, and who</seg><seg type="columnLine">left one's skin a mass of aching bites and blisters?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Probably due to the transportation of their eggs in rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way coaches and motor cars and in the garments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">travelers, they quickly spread across the country; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the summer was over, there were few cities and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely a countryside in the United States in which one</seg><seg type="columnLine">could safely venture abroad without covering one's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hands with mosquito netting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But worse still--though for a while it seemed im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to believe that anything could be worse--was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new species of wood-burrowing beetles, whose jaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the efficiency and the cutting power of steel blades.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is hard to say how many buildings they undermined,</seg><seg type="columnLine">excavating in the walls and foundations and living on an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclusive diet of wood. It is only known that thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dwellings, apparently substantial a few months be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, suddenly were in a state of collapse, their floors</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walls giving way, their posts and pillars weak as</seg><seg type="columnLine">cardboard. And invariably thousands of little gray-green</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetles, scarcely a quarter of an inch in length, would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found complacently dining among the ruins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But for the average man, if he were fortunate enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to be made homeless by the beetles or goaded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-extinction by the flies, perhaps the most distressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about the entire era was the confusion that gave it</seg><seg type="columnLine">its name. One could not approach an ant or a butterfly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and be sure that it would not squirt poison into one's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. One could not befriend a homeless dog without</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspecting that it was about to spring at one's throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One could not observe a browsing cow without fear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would charge like a maddened bull. One could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">feed a dove without danger of being slashed as by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagle, or watch an eagle without the possibility of hear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it cooing; one could not be certain whether the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture swimming in a pond were a duck or a webbed hen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or whether the bird of brilliant plumage were a pheasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a transformed sea-gull; and one would have to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to be surprised at seeing the deer giving chase to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fox, or the sparrow darting in pursuit of the falcon, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the worm turning and defying the early robin. Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">sights, during those astounding years, 1964 and 1965,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to become the merest commonplaces; and the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that any one knew positively was that the action</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all creatures alike had become unpredictable. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature herself gone crazy? Had the laws of thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of years suddenly been suspended? Not so! as we of</seg><seg type="columnLine">today realize well enough; the trouble was due solely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">those misfit creations of Gilcrest, all of which, whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">their particular characteristics, possessed one attribute</seg><seg type="columnLine">in superlative degree: the power of reproducing rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and prolifically, and of endowing their descendants with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own astonishing qualities. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the changes introduced by Gilcrest did not confine</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves to the animal world. They were botanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as zoological in their nature; and there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who maintained that the worst pests of all were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new plants. One could hardly be blamed for ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">A CIRCE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF SCIENCE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">173</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jecting, for example, to the exquisite red rose with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">odor of carrion; or to the lily with the concealed sabre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like spines that would leap out unexpectedly and stab</seg><seg type="columnLine">one; or to the grass with the tar-like exudation, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">made whole fields resemble great patches of sticky fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper; or to the little vine-grown fruits which, despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">their similarity to the blackberry, had an acrid, unfor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gettable taste comparable to that of ink. Or, again, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a right to complain when the pollen oi certain new</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants contaminated the seeds of fruits and vegetables, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that cucumbers had a habit of becoming sweet like water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">melons, and watermelons of being sugar less as cucum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers; while one could never be sure, upon opening an</seg><seg type="columnLine">orange, whether it was not to be sour as a lime; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon slicing a tomato for one's salad, one would feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunate if it did not have the flavor of red pepper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was as if nature, like some malicious jester, had per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed feats of jugglery, until everything was topsy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turvy, and one could not know when one was to fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim to some unprecedented prank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what could be done to restore the world to sanity?</seg><seg type="columnLine">How conquer the formidable array of animal and vege-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table freaks ? This was a question of crucial importance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for mankind was being more than harried and annoyed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was being demoralized; men no longer went as usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">about their daily work; they toiled, if at all, in a nerve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, half-hearted manner, and with the irritation of be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings under a perpetual shadow; incalculable numbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were giving way to hysteria, and even to insanity;</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands upon thousands were roaming the land at ran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom, without reason or purpose; crimes of passion and</seg><seg type="columnLine">violence were becoming frequent as never before, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time there was an aimlessness never previously</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed in the ordinary affairs of life. Had the Day of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Judgment been impending, men could scarcely have be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haved in a more haphazard, irrational way--for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid earth seemed to be slipping from beneath them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the ensuing chaos they had no firm goal at which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to clutch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor could the wisest among them offer much aid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philosophy had no word of advice to utter; religion</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood back dazed and speechless; even science apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not extend a helping hand. And yet science was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing its eager best to solve the dilemma; science had</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung open ten thousand laboratories, wherein physicians</seg><seg type="columnLine">and biologists, bacteriologists and chemists were labor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to combat the pest. The record of the year and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of research has many heroic anecdote to show,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in a practical way it accomplished nothing. During</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interval, Gilcrest's plants and animals had spread to</seg><seg type="columnLine">every corner of the globe, and yet not one thing had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been done--absolutely not one thing--that promised to</seg><seg type="columnLine">end the Reign of Confusion! In vain did the researchers</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment with poisons and deadly fumes; in vain</seg><seg type="columnLine">did they attempt to wipe out the invaders by methods of</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct slaughter. No task ever undertaken has ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared more hopeless; the new species were not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost impossible to recognize at sight, but they multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied so rapidly that in most cases two were born for</seg><seg type="columnLine">every one that was killed. Such, indeed, was their rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of increase that it seemed likely that the world would,</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon be over-run with them! And the more pessimistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">--who included two persons out of every three--began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">predict that before long the earth would become unin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitable for man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the summer of 1965, it seemed likely that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">prediction was to be fulfilled. Throughout the length</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and breadth of the civilized world, pestilence was spread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; agriculture had almost come to a standstill; com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merce and industry, when they had not ceased altogether,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged on as lamely as a dog on three legs. And since</seg><seg type="columnLine">little food was being produced, and still less transported,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inhabitants of all the great cities of the earth began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cry out despairingly for bread; while half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">plagues, arising simultaneously, as plagues always will</seg><seg type="columnLine">arise in time of want, began to take toll of the famished</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives of all lands. And meanwhile there was no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to seize control of . the disorganized wheels of world</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs, no one to put the farmers back upon the land,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laborers back in the abandoned factories. Only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few persevering scientists, struggling to stem the tide</seg><seg type="columnLine">of disaster somewhat as a child with a toy shovel might</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle against a river floor, were still seeking a solution</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the problem; and even they were not far from con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessing themselves beaten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In that terrible summer of 1965, the hospitals swarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the sick and dying; the streets were made dismal</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the wailings of the bereaved, the moans and sighs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hungry and the hopeless; and the churches of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands were filled with weeping and praying penitents</seg><seg type="columnLine">who foresaw the end of the world. Even the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">courageous fraction of mankind, who held that our race</seg><seg type="columnLine">would yet come to terms whh the invaders, were assured</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the world would henceforth be a harsher and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult place in which to live. And meanwhile none,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even the most optimistic, anticipated the sudden and</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete vanquishing of the enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Or, rather, none--with only one known, exception.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In those hysterical days, when most of us hovered pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cariously on the brink of unreason, few persons paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">much attention to the insistent young woman who pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed that she had had a vision foretelling the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Reign of Confusion. "All the new species are lacking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one essential," she contended, "and that is racial</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenacity of life. The very force that brought them so</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly into being will remove them as suddenly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">our midst. They are freaks who owe their existence to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creative energy in the light rays that produced them;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that creative energy will be exhausted very soon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as the electricity in a storage battery is exhausted;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all the plants and animals will perish."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Owing to the definite terms in which this prophecy</seg><seg type="columnLine">was couched, there were those who suspected that it did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not represent a vision at all, but rather a shrewd bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific foresight. At all events, the young woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">prognostication was to be tellingly verified. Early in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">autumn of 1965, when the world had sunk to its lowest</seg><seg type="columnLine">depth of despondency and want, and when pestilence</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ferreting out the quarters of rich and poor alike,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an extraordinary fact was announced. The stinging flies</seg><seg type="columnLine">--were growing less abundant, and in some districts had</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely ceasecj to be seen! And the burrowing beetles</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not half so noticeable as before! At first, upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing these tidings, men merely opened their eyes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise, and then, with hopeless nods, turned away--</seg><seg type="columnLine">such false reports had reached them too often! . But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not many weeks before a gleam of hope began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear in even the most hopeless eyes. It seemed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credible, but it was undeniably true!--one no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw dogs climbing trees; sparrows did not growl or</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravens sing, canaries no longer displayed the inclinations</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hawks!

If Keller had come to Rochester, Jack did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, but the fact remained that it had been years since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two had seen each other. And now Jack did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know why he had come to one of the old brownstone</seg><seg type="columnLine">fronts, where Keller continued to live, even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">downtown New York was encroaching upon the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">street where Grandfather Keller had built his home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At college Charlie and he had been good friends.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They might even have been called chums in those good</seg><seg type="columnLine">old days of camaraderie, but with the graduation each</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone his own way, each to his own home-tawn, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his own interests. And now Jack knew that Charlie</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dabbling in science. At school he had been a shark</seg><seg type="columnLine">for chemistry and physics, so it was not unnatural, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlie's old man had left him plenty of wherewithal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which he could devote himself to his old love. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">or twice Jack had seen his name in the papers, referring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his work in the field of X-rays. There was even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain little doo-dad on the medical X-ray machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">which bore Keller's name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And here he was waiting in the old antiquated draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing room of the Keller brownstone, while an almost as</seg><seg type="columnLine">antiquated butler went to inform his master of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advent of a guest. In a few minutes Warren heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">footsteps running down the stairs and Charlie of old</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood before him. The one-time chums shook hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmly, voiced equally as warm greetings, and sur- *</seg><seg type="columnLine">reptiously eyed each other for the changes the years</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have brought. There followed a few minutes of"</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminiscences of college days. However, through it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keller appeared restlessly nervous, and after the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave of greeting had passed he spoke in jerky sentences.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pardon my rush, Jack, old man, but I've just left some</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of mine up-stairs that can't stand waiting. Wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I finish--or would you prefer to come to the lab.</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wait? Just a half hour or so and I'll be ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show you the town, or what have you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, sorry, if I interrupted you, Charlie. I'll go along</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you. I understand you've done some big work in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keller was modest about what he called his success</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he led the way up the carpeted stairs and into the ,</seg><seg type="columnLine">large room upon the the third floor that he called his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lab. 1 Jack was surprised to discover the wealth of equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that filled the room. He himself had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a scientific laboratory since he had left the university.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keller left him alone while he went into a box-like affair</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in one corner of the room that Jack recognized as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark room. Left alone, Warren strolled about the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">gingerly peering at the various apparatus, retorts, arrays</seg><seg type="columnLine">of glass tubes and other paraphernalia. He came to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">before what looked to him like an ordinary camera, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had several strange looking attachments, which he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not try to understand. Then Keller appeared from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark room carrying several small sheets of developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">photographs that he was handling carefully. On seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his guest looking at the camera he observed, "Ah my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Z-ray camera interests you, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Warren turned to him. "Z-ray? Isn't that something</seg><seg type="columnLine">new ? I thought you were devoted to the X-ray."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keller grinned. "I had to study the X-ray to be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to discover the Z-ray. They \w&gt;rk in conjunction."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, do they?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keller seemed hesitant. Then he thrust forward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">photographs that were still damp from the developing</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution. He watched his friend's face as he studied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures. Warren looked at them a minute, then he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinning. "Oh, you and Conan Doyle, eh? Since when</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you been interested in fairies, Charlie ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keller smiled back. "Ever since I was knee-high to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">duck, Jack."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Warren whistled. "But really you are not going into</seg><seg type="columnLine">this thing seripusly, old man! Why, you'll be a laugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing stock, if that gets out. Is that what all this means?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he waved an arm to take in the camera and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keller nodded. "It's a long story, Charlie, and I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">not told a soul yet, but since you dropped in on me on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very day that I found it, you are welcome to hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean, Charlie, that you have actually photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graphed those things--that. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keller nodded again. "It is true, and if you don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe me I'll take you out in the garden and let you</seg><seg type="columnLine">photograph them yourself! It was lucky for me that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found one of the 'holes' right in my own garden!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"WHAT 'n world are you talking about? Tell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> » » me, you haven't lost your mind . . . like so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these inventor fellows do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other laughed at that, and without another ward</seg><seg type="columnLine">he picked up the camera and led Warren downstairs ami</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a side door that led into a pretty garden in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear of the house. One does not expect to find such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a beauty spot in the heart of the fifties, and that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">added to its charm in the days of Grandfather Keller.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had built up the entire square block of houses in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, but in their center he had preserved enough ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make the garden what it was. And it had been the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">175</seg><seg type="columnLine">176</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">scene of many a fete in the old days. There was a frog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pond, and tall cedar trees on its rim, a rose garden that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore every species of rose known to man, a gravel walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">that drifted in and about the hedgerows and a little bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a sunken garden. At one end, against a tall stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">mossy wall, was a loggia where were set a half dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden chairs, and here and there in the garden were ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged little bowers that invited a twosome. Keller pere</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been somewhat of a poet. Here as a boy Charlie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keller had spent almost all of his boyhood, and here</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been many a love-quarrel forgotten. People had</seg><seg type="columnLine">visited the Kellers just to stroll in the old-fashioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden. And now Charlie had found another use for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took Warren-along the gravel walk to a corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">where was placed a stone bench and near itxn a pedestal</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood a "round tummied" Cupid, ready to shoot one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arrows. Keller squinted up at the sun. It was four</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock of a mid-summer day so that the sun was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">high enough for taking pictures. Carefully he set his</seg><seg type="columnLine">camera on the bench and kneeling upon the grass he</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed his eye against the peephole, and spent a half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen minutes in focusing it properly. He motioned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warren to come close, and put the bulb of the camera</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand. "Push," he told his friend, and Jack, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though to humor a maniac, did so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, now," observed Keller, "you've done it!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You've photographed two fairies!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Warren was now certain that the other was out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, but he managed a grin, though he wanted to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back and leave Charlie and his toys forever. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlie Keller understood what was passing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack's mind and sympathetically he smiled. "Here, Jack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">look in for yourself and ask yourself if you are dream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing or not," he suggested. "You think I'm crazy, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">after you see what I have seen, decide then whether or</seg><seg type="columnLine">not you call me or yourself insane."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reluctantly Warren knelt and placed his eye to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighting hole of the camera, expecting to see nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than the leaves of the rose bush that faced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camera's eye. And for a moment he did not seen any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, but Keller urged him to continue to look through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was that beautiful shade of light that had crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">into everything? The very light itself was entrancing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he saw something that so startled him that he lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">his balance and sat on the ground with a plop. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was back again at the camera staring with the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wonder and misbelief at what he had seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were a dozen feet away, or so it appeared in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the camera. They were fairies, those little bits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ephemeral things with their gauzy wings and dresses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flower petals. And there was--by gosh--there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an elf--just as one sees them in children's picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">books. Why, out there was a world of tiny flying things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no larger than a half a dozen inches high and flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">about like butterflies and bees! It was incredible, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they moved and they were alive. There was one tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature sticking its head into the heart of a flower, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet, and when it looked up again, it appeared as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it had just relished a tidbit!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Warren could not tear his eyes from the camera. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the strangest and most beautiful sight he had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. Then he looked on beyond the fairies, to a pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of flower covered ground with clouds and blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">skies overhead where before had been only a rose bush</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the garden wall beyond! Realizing this, Warren</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his eyes away and glared almost angrily at Keller</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">who was standing a foot away and smiling broadly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Say, what's this? Are you trying to play with me,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Charlie Keller? Why this thing's no more than one of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">those penny-shows you see in a machine in Coney</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Island!" He was blustering now over the hoax which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he thought his friend had pulled upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Don't be a fool, Jack. Do you think I'd bother to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bring you into the garden for that? And where could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one photograph those things? No, my friend, you have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">simply been looking into the Fourth Dimension! And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">those creatures you saw there are really living and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enjoying life as you see them. I could not have 'faked'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">such a scene. Now, could I?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But Charlie, it's impossible," muttered Warren, his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blustering gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No, no, Jack, it is the truth. Come into the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I had better tell you more about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">HE picked up the camera almost lovingly, and pre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ceded Warren through the garden. About to enter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the house, he paused. "No, on second thought, let's sit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">here in the garden. It's more pleasant, and besides, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">story will sound better out here where it belongs." He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">led the way to the company of wicker chairs under the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">loggia. He pressed a buzzer and in a minute or so the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">antiquated butler came forth beaming, bearing a tray</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with its decanter of rare brandy and the glasses. Thus</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">refreshed Charlie began to talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "As a child, Jack, I believed in fairies. Of course</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lots of children do--or used to. I don't know if they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have lost the capacity of believing in this day of machines</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and traffic regulations^--I hope not--for I can remember</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the joy with which I used to listen to all stories about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fairies and their ilk. Not the stories of Fairy Princes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and of Witches that one finds so prevalent in a certain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">type of so-called Fairy Tales, but the stories of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">doings of the Little Folk. I think that of all writers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Lord Dunsany had come closer to the real heart of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fairies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "In those days I had an old nurse, Irish Nora. Per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">haps that accounts for my deep love and understanding</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the Wee People.

Also I knew a few words of Irish</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaelic learned from that old nurse of mine. So I began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make friends and always I managed to lead the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation around to the Wee People, I knew that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irish are somewhat frightened to speak of them, for they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will still talk of changelings and the little brownies who</seg><seg type="columnLine">come and turn the milk sour overnight. And I heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great many tales of that description. Also tales of folk</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been given wishes by the fairies, in reward</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some good deed performed in their behalf, or of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old woman who had been starving and awoke one morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to find the cat she had fed, despite her adversities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing with a piece of silver, and that thereafter every</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning she found another piece of money under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat's paw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only I was not content to listen to these tales.

That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ring in the grass that was unmistakable and which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was told was danced upon by the fairies at night!

Three, of those I met</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with, denied that they knew of such a place, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought all were lying. Then I met the crone.

Giant gnarled old trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaned and moaned in the wind, and the grass under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot was long and gone to seed.

Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not a perfect circle as I had been led to believe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but an uneven, ragged line, circular, though roughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn. Surely fairies would not have danced that way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With beating heart I approached it, examined it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to collect my thoughts, for with its finding had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come a dazed sort of mind.

They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were sitting about either on the grass or upon the leaves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of a bush close by. The gnome squatted on the project-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing root of the plant. Not three feet away sat a brown</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rabbit with ears cocked surveying us all. The fairy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">people were taking me all in and appeared to have been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">waiting patiently for some time for me to awake. One</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the elves stretched his tiny arms and yawned.

There is a direct chain of scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific reasoning to support the large animal body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a fair prospect of its ultimate realization in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory. Whereas the gravity screen is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a priori an impossibility, largely because we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced, by the new views of the universe, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is no such thing as the force of gravity. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity is not a force, how can it be screened?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gravity is a relationship of motion and position;</seg><seg type="columnLine">how can an abstraction like that be screened?

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved it in this wise: the entire weight of the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell was used when it hit to compress the air caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">under it. The air of course would start leaking out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the small pipe, or shooting out, very rapidly. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the small pipe was submerged, however, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation took place almost instantly, the compressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">air shot a plug of water up to the sailor's head with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of a bullet--and slew him.

Therefore, he would need eight times the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscular power for his original activity. To give</seg><seg type="columnLine">him eight times as much power, the average cross*</seg><seg type="columnLine">section of his muscles would have to be eight times</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much as normal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An increase in length of the muscle would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">help; it is the cross-section that would be required.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A horse twice as big as normal would already</seg><seg type="columnLine">have twice the normal cross section, therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice the power.

That is, to give him four</seg><seg type="columnLine">times more muscle cross-section than he already</seg><seg type="columnLine">had, his muscles would all have to be of twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">the relative diameter that they are on a normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This- double relative muscle diameter would</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly be noticeable as we looked at the horse; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be evident as an. increased plumpness. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can remember, the greatest difference in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameters of biceps muscles I have personally seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make the largest three times'.the diameter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the smallest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Therefore, the larger the animal, the greater its</seg><seg type="columnLine">relative muscle volume.

I eliminated it from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussion because it has inherent practical defects</seg><seg type="columnLine">that limit its use in a discussion on acceleration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A rocket gets its power and speed by ejecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning gases. The weight of unused fuel must</seg><seg type="columnLine">then be carried when we leave Earth, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be lifted against Earth's gravity as we leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet. The more slowly we burn that fuel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the longer it lasts, and the further we..go while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fuel is still being carried. Hence, the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">work we do in lifting fuel. If we burn the fuel</seg><seg type="columnLine">very quickly, get rid of a great portion of it before</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have lifted it very far, we do less work on</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifting fuel. Thus, the more rapidly the rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">discharges its fuel, the more efficient it is. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket necessitates a high acceleration, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were discussing the effects of acceleration on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men alone, so I suggested that we consider any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other type, a type which will permit of as low a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate of acceleration as we wish without impaired</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficiency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, as I have said, an acceleration of four</seg><seg type="columnLine">times gravity would not be dangerous, and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably be quite endurable.

If the pressure is increased on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other hand, the oxygen concentration is in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased with it, until, when the pressure reaches</seg><seg type="columnLine">that due to a depth of 175 feet of water, the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">might as well be breathing pure oxygen at</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal pressure. It is this effect of increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxidation rate, faster living, that produces some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dangerous effects in the caisson. In an</seg><seg type="columnLine">interplanetary machine the damage is done by</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical pressure on the organs, a thing we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can in no way approach on earth, save by using</seg><seg type="columnLine">a centrifugal force seat, for instance, and thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce the effect of heavy accelerations. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">flatten one's heart against the walls of the chest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is the effect most to be dreaded, plus the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical pressure on the brain. There is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">known way to lessen these, so,' as a matter of fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bathtub would be of little real assistance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it would at least be more restful, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve the fatiguing strain of the pressure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I wish to make a reply to the comment of Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">E.

As</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as an airship would get away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth far enough to practically eliminate gravity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and be in a vacuum, it would need very little fuel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So for the first many thousand miles of its travels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather millions of miles, it would use very little</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuel, as, traveling in a vacuum, it would have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">head resistance, and would not have to be sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported against gravity. Then after reaching a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain point it would be attracted by the gravity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planet to which it is traveling and here its</seg><seg type="columnLine">use for fuel would be not to drive it ahead, but to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent it from going too fast. So when anybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes on a trip to Mars or any other interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, we do not. feel that they need worry much</seg><seg type="columnLine">about,the fuel question.

THE GRAPH</seg><seg type="columnLine">OF AMAZING STORIES</seg><seg type="columnLine">Editor, Auazikc Stories:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I have indexed Amazing Stories since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first volume was completed, it recently came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head that it might be interesting to graph each</seg><seg type="columnLine">volume, issue by issue, in accordance with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">system by which I grade stories in the Index--</seg><seg type="columnLine">three stars for exceptional stories, two stars for</seg><seg type="columnLine">very good ones, one star for stories worth read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but rarely worth rereading. Only eight stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">have fallen below one star in four years, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">four issues including the February issue have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect, containing 100 per cent three starred</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories. All these have been in Volume 4. Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt that one or two poor stories might drag</seg><seg type="columnLine">down an otherwise excellent issue, I inaugurated</seg><seg type="columnLine">a -"Bonus" system of averaging, whereby issues</seg><seg type="columnLine">containing a majority of three-star stories gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">one point above the numerical mean, a majority</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two-star stories, gained }4 point, and a 'perfect"</seg><seg type="columnLine">issue gained two points. In the rare cases when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the issue came just below the majority for either</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonus, I have judged by the tone of the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">issue, whether or not to grant the extra credit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Such an issue is the June issue of this year, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">also the July issue, in which the extra value was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in each case added, the actual average making</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of the stories triple-starred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking back at the first years of the Index,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seems that I was then almost undnly critical,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as there are several stories to which I would at</seg><seg type="columnLine">present give higher rating. However, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">represent my judgment at the time, and as I fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember any story worth rating, I have not</seg><seg type="columnLine">altered the grading. As the graphs stand, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">represent, aside from actual progress, an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panding tolerance and judgment from a Sophomore</seg><seg type="columnLine">in High School to a Junior in Union College, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ages of 14 to 18--an important period.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 believe that the graphs are most valuable un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed. When I have time, I hope to plot another</seg><seg type="columnLine">set of graphs, showing the influence of each issue</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the cumulative average, and showing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">percentages of three- and two-starred stories. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are interested, I will be glad to send them</seg><seg type="columnLine">when finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The graphs for both Monthly and Quarterly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">show that after the novelty of the first year fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, the quality of the issues began to slump (possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bly paralleling a slump in sales?) However, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">average did not fall far, and in the third year a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise took place, especially noticeable in the Bonus</seg><seg type="columnLine">graph, leading to another sag toward the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the year. Suddenly, during the winter and spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 1929, the level shot up, reaching its first peak</seg><seg type="columnLine">of "Perfection" in May, 1929, then dropping, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not far, and again shooting up to its present sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit--three "Perfect'' issues in five months--with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the volume-averages the highest in history. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">will probably find parallel occurrences, of which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran know nothing, in your circulation and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">data. What is most interesting is the rapid climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">to excellency--so consistent a climb that I fear--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hope--that I will soon have to remodel my</seg><seg type="columnLine">grading system or slide along at an even "three" of</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfection. One of the great advances, of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have not taken account, except subconsciously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the improvement in artists, especially in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquisition of Briggs. Paul was good, in his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellent, but he had marked weakness, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">change since he left is remarkable. We will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to frame our covers soon. Vary the cover artist</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, if you can, and let him choose the story which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he considers best from the point of view of poten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tial illustration.

I have agreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far with your choice of sequels, and in all but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few cases I have been disappointed with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result. I almost felt that it would be best to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have an entirely different author write the sequel</seg><seg type="columnLine">or sequels, as Jules Verne did so wonderfully for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wyss's ''The Swiss Family Robinson." Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">this is a personal opinion, as the above is a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal rating and graphing, but I wonder if I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only one who feels that way about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While it is not wise to neglect the excellent</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern fiction and let it go to the bettering of at</seg><seg type="columnLine">present inferior competitors, I think that at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">one long classic--by Wells, Verne, Cummings, A.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Merritt, H. Rider Haggard, Clement Fczandie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garrett P. Serviss, or one of the other authors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">most recommended by readers--should be printed</seg><seg type="columnLine">each year, with several shorter ones--only the best.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know that many readers oppose this view, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder what direct vote would show--and which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is better literarily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In accordance with your present and near future</seg><seg type="columnLine">policy, what lengths will you consider in fiction</seg><seg type="columnLine">by unestablished authors? This question has a</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal background, for in my college course in</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemistry, 1 frequently run across phenomena</seg><seg type="columnLine">and concepts that I feel would make good fiction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I get a great kick out of writing them up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">developing them, as well as a good bit of knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge, for I usually have to put a good deal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">study of fact into the development. Most of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have scrapped, as too near something that has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been written before, but I have a few that are new</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all run to length--the wrong length, it seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. My longest and most hopeful, would take</seg><seg type="columnLine">up twelve or thirteen pages, maybe more, as its</seg><seg type="columnLine">length is about 16,000 words, but I have hopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">for shorter ones, one on the Arrhenius theory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life spores that will be finished soon. There is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine in which I would rather see them, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">may get up courage to send one in, though each</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I read them they seem worse from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">literary viewpoint. Aside from my own interest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a statement as to generally encouraged lengths</seg><seg type="columnLine">might help out some other discouraged author who</seg><seg type="columnLine">wants to bud and doesn't dare. I may not succeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an author, even if 1 do as a chemist, but I'll go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on writing, as a way to develop a concept, just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">long as I am struck by new phenomena and new</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibilities--and I'll keep on getting a kick out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, and a lot of knowledge from reading Plato</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Rubcnius, studying infinite series, topography,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or primitive mythology, or working out perspec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives and' planetary motions for a background to</seg><seg type="columnLine">what may develop of its own accord into an actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory or merely a story. There seems to me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a great field unopened in taking folk lore</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously and building on its strongest points, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Verrill did in "The Bridge of Light." Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is mathematics, probably the most beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sciences, as well as the most fundamental</seg><seg type="columnLine">and independent. We limit our mathematical fic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to the fourth dimension--Good, excellent, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not enough. Here, "John Jones' Dollar," by Henry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stephen Kcler, April, 1927, and "Futility," by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Capt. S. P. Meek, July, 1929, are exceptions. Last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not least, we steer clear of the extremes, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper limit of "The People of the Pit," "The Face</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Abyss," "The Moon Pool," "The Thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from--Outside," and "The Color Out of Space,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">of A. Merritt, H. P. Lovecraft, and Allan Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land--where lies the greatest work and the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">good in scientifiction, the enlarging of • the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept, the mental grasping at something attainable</seg><seg type="columnLine">but just out of reach of the pictorial and sensual</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination, concepts which one must grasp at</seg><seg type="columnLine">with man's greatest and least used weapon--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of pure thought and imagination. I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulp down and understand totally the silent ones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the People, the Face, the meaning and powers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing or color, but I can almost do it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time I may. Great mathematicians can see</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentally the fourth dimension of mathematics as</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a lifting haze. So it is with the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">works of scientifiction, even Burroughs' scheme of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evolution in "The Land that Time Forgot," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as my mind develops through study, the haze is</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifting with each rereading. I hope that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be more beyond the rising fringes when I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to see that far. After all, there is not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much difference between these frontiers of scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tifiction and the concepts of pure religion and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pure philosophy, is there? 'All deal with ultimates,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with great enveloping fundamental forces, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it takes an eternity to grasp--with the wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibilities of the Cosmos--and scientifiction is</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing it the closest of the three. Too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be paralyzing to the mind, but can we tuit</seg><seg type="columnLine">have more of these near heresies of possibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">and less of the hidebound?

Although such a device would have •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> more recoil in the earth's atmosphere by having</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the air to react against, it stands to reason that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the friction of the air'would just about counter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> act this added impetus. Another reason I favor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the rocket type of travel is because of the fact,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that* the rocket tubes can be arranged for steer-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ing the ship in any direction while out in space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This should not be overlooked as one might easily</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> become lost or get off his course while flying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> through space, if he didn't have a means with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> which to guide his ship where he wished.

You could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">push against an object with a bar or solid object,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but how could you push against anything with a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stream of gas which has absolutely no solidity? If</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one did get into interplanetary space with some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">kind of a motor ship, it is hard to imagine any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">method of driving it through the vacuum other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than the rocket principle. The propellers of an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">airplane would be absolutely futile there, but rocket</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">propulsion would operate very well. The reason</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that power has to be expended in driving an air-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plane is twofold. It has to overcome the action of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gravitation and the resistance of the air. These</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are so tied up together that it is the stream of air</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flowing over the surface of the wings which sup-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ports the plane. But if you got up into inter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">planetary space and were so far removed from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">celestial bodies that gravitation would be almost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">negligible, there woud be nothing to stop you from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">going ahead and hardly any power would be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">required to keep you aloft, as. the sailors say. So</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">once your rocket got you up one hundred miles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or so, a rocket not. much bigger than a firecracker</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would almost have a visible effect on the propul-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sion. No one knows what light, gravity and mag-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">netism are. There is a current belief that man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will never find out the cause of gravity.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">this respect Ouspensky's views are rather inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esting. In anattemptto prove the Kaptian dogma lof</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subjectivity of Space and Time he agrees with</seg><seg type="columnLine">H. G. Wells that they are identical and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Time is the 4th dimension of Space imperfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensed. Applyingr this hypothesis to the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">about us he suggests that a snail, for example,</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessing only sensation, exists in a one-dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional world, or senses the world as existing on an</seg><seg type="columnLine">infinite line. An animal, say a dog, possessing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation and perception and seeing only surfaces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">construes the world as two dimensional, or as</seg><seg type="columnLine">existing on an infinite plane. A man, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation, perception and1 conception also sees</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but surfaces, but he conceives the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimension, and the 4th dimension of Space he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazily construes as Time. Thus, if we admit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory of evolution as an ever present factor in</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence, it follows that man may arrive at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental state as high above conception as conception</seg><seg type="columnLine">is above mere perception, and as Space is sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jective, he would to all intents and purposes be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a four dimensional being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But enough of metaphysics.
