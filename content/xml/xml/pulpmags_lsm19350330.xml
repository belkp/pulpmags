                    <ab>Have tried the Vacu-matic and it sure is fine. Better pick-up with a 30% gas sav- ing--John C. Martin, Pa.</ab>

                    <ab>V-8 Ford</ab>
                    <ab>I installed both Vacu-matics and they work excel-lent. On my own V8 Ford I notice wonderful perfor-mance in pick up, get-away
                        and gas saving.- Burt Burnett, Mich.</ab>
                    <ab>Buick</ab>
                    <ab>Everything you claim about Vacu matic is true. I now get 20 miles to the gallon. Be-fore I was only averaging 15 1/2 miles. -

                    <ab>Franklin</ab>
                    <ab>With Vacu-matic I have increased my mileage from 10.1 to 14.2 miles per gallon. I figure I save over $75.00 a year in

                    <ab>Saves $180 A Year</ab>
                    <ab> On my Plymouth 6 I obtained an average of 22 miles per gallon, an increase of 7 miles. This means a savings of $15 a month or
                        $180 a year. F S. Peck, Calif</ab>
                    <ab>Chevrolet</ab>
                    <ab>Please send me a Vacu-matic for a Model A. The milage on my 1933 Chevro-let jumped from 18 to 22 miles per gal. with
                        Vacu-matic.- Paul P. Haas, Mass.</ab>
                    <ab>All Well Pleased</ab>
                    <ab>Enclosed find order for 12 more. Everyone I have sold is giving 4-to-6 more miles per gallon. I have 3 more orders for V8

                    <ab>On my Advanced 6 Nash gained 17 1/2% in milaeage. The car will idle down to 3 miles inan hour and then take gas with-out a
                        complaint. -J.Showalter, Mo.</ab>
                    <ab>Dodge</ab>
                    <ab>Just complieted 2310 miles on 92 gallons in my 1933 Dodge 6. This figures 25 miles while befoer I aver-aged only 20 miles per

                    <ab>Patent Pending</ab>
                    <ab>AT LAST! Automotive engineers have smashed down the barriers to perfected combustion! The new VACU-MATIC solves the secret of
                        greater power! With almost magical action, this amazing inven- tion instantly puts new life and pep in any motor. It adds
                        mileage to every gallon of gasoline . . . produces split-second pick-up, sensitive accelerator response, greater speed and
                        smoother running </ab>

                        years! With it, engineers have achieved a practical means of balancing air and gasoline automatically for all speeds:
                        Vacu-matic is entirely different! It is AUTOMATIC and allows the motor to "breathe" at the correct time, opening and closing
                        automatically as required. No idling troubles--no carburetor adjust-ments necessary. Just put it on and forget it! Sharply cuts
                        fuel wastes, saves dollars in gas costs, reduces carbon and gives your engine new pep, greater power and longer life.</ab>
                    <ab>Fits All Cars</ab>
                    <ab>VACU-MATIC is constructed of six parts, assembled and welded into one unit, correctly adjusted and sealed at the-factory.
                        Nothing to regulate. Any motorist can attach VACU- MATIC in ten minutes. Once in, its only reminder is the surge of instant
                        power and speed it gives to the motor and the savings it affords your pocketbook.</ab>

                        <ab>For several years, he was just like a score of other men in the plant--a good, honest, fairly capable worker, but only
                            that. There was nothing distinc-tive about him or his ability--nothing to make him stand out from the crowd--no reason, as a
                            matter of fact, why he should ever receive a raise.</ab>
                        <ab>Then one fortunate day he decided that the reason he wasn't getting anywhere was because he lacked special training. He
                            searched around a bit --asked a great many questions--and then en- rolled for a home-study course with the Inter- national
                            Correspondence Schools.</ab>
                        <ab>"Soon after I began studying," he wrote to us the other day, "we had a change in management at our plant. The new

                            to study in my spare time. For, thanks to my I. C. S. course, I was the only man in the organization who could talk to the
                            superintendent in his own lan-guage. As a result, I was promoted over men who had been here from ten to twenty

                            Institute of America bases its writing instruction on journalism--con- tinuous writing--the training that has produced so
                            many successful authors.</ab>
                        <ab>Learn to write by writing</ab>
                        <ab>NEWSPAPER Institute training is based on the New York Copy-Desk Method. It starts and keeps you writing in your own home,
                            on your own time. Week by week you receive actual assignments, just as if you were right at work on a great metropolitan
                            daily. Your writing is individually corrected and constructively criticized. A group of men, whose combined newspaper
                            experience totals more than 200 years, are responsible for this instruction. Un-der such sympathetic guidance, you will
                            find that (instead of vainly trying to copy some one else's writing tricks) you are rapidly developing your own
                            distinctive, self-flavored style--undergoing an experience that has a thrill to it and which at the same time de- velops in
                            you the power to make your feelings articulate. Many people who should be writing become awe-struck by fabulous stories
                            about millionaire authors and, therefore, give little thought to the $25, $50 and $100 or more that can often be earned
                            for ma- terial that takes little time to write--stories, articles on business, fads, travels, sports, recipes, etc.--things
                            that can easily be turned out in leisure hours, and often on the impulse of the moment.</ab>

                    <ab>Help Your Kidneys Don't Take Drastic Drugs</ab>
                    <ab>You have 9 million tiny tubes or filters in your kidneys, which are at work night and day cleaning out Acids and poisonous
                        wastes and purifying your blood, which circulates through your kidneys 200 times an hour. So it's no wonder that poorly
                        functioning Kidneys may be the real cause of feeling tired, run-down, nervous, Getting Up Nights, Rheumatic Pains and other
                        troubles.</ab>
                    <ab>Nearly everyone is likely to suffer from poorly functioning Kidneys at times because modern foods and drinks, weather changes,
                        exposure, colds, nervous strain, worry and over-work often place an extra heavy load on the Kidneys.</ab>
                    <ab>But when your Kidneys need help, don't take chances with drastic or irritating drugs. Be careful. If poorly functioning
                        Kidneys or Bladder make you suffer from Get-ting Up Nights, Leg Pains, Nervousness, Stiffness, Burning, Smarting, Itching
                        Acidity, Rheumatic Pains, Lumbago, Loss of Vitality, Dark Circles under the eyes, or Dizziness, don't waste a minute. Try the
                        Doctor's prescription Cystex (pro- nounced Siss-tex). See for yourself the amazing quickness with which it soothes, tones and
                        cleans raw, sore irritated membranes.</ab>
                    <ab>Cystex is a remarkably successful prescription for poorly functioning Kidneys and Bladder. It is helping millions of
                        sufferers, and many say that in just a day or so it helped them sleep like a baby, brought new strength and energy, eased
                        rheumatic pains and stiffness--made them feel years younger. Cystex is swift, safe and sure in action. It helps the Kidneys in
                        their work of cleaning out the blood and removing poisonous acids and wastes in the system. Cystex is a scientifically
                        prepared prescription and your doctor or druggist can tell you it does not contain any dopes, narcotics or habit-forming
                        drugs. The formula is in every package.</ab>
                    <ab>Because of its amazing and almost world- wide success, the Doctor's Prescription known as Cystex, (pronounced Siss-tex) is
                        offered to sufferers of poor Kidney and Blad- der functions under the fair-play guarantee to fix you up to your complete
                        satisfaction or money back on return of empty pack- age. It's only 3c a dose. Ask your druggist for Cystex today and see,for
                        yourself how much younger, stronger and better you can feel by simply clean- ing out your Kidneys. Cystex must do the work or
                        cost you nothing.</ab>
                    <ab>City Health Doctor Praises Cystex</ab>
                    <ab>Dr. W.R. George</ab>
                    <ab>Doctors and druggists everywhere approve of the prescription Cystex because of its splendid ingredients and quick action. For
                        instance, Dr. W. R. George, graduate Medical Dept., University of Indiana, former Health Commissioner of Indianapolis, and
                        Medical Di- rector for insurance company 10 year, recently wrote the following letter:</ab>
                    <ab>"There is little question but what properly func- tioning Kidney and Bladder organs are vital to tbe health. Insufficient
                        Kidney excretions are the cause of much needless suffering with aching back, weakness, painful joints and rheumatic pains,
                        headaches and a general run-down, exhausted body. This condition also interferes with normal rest at night by causing the
                        sufferer to rise frequently for relief, and results in painful excretion, itching, smarting and burning. I am of the opinion
                        that Cystex definitely corrects frequent causes (poor kidney functions) of such conditions and I have actually prescribed in
                        my own practice for many years past the same ingredients contained in your formula. Cystex not only exerts a splendid in-
                        fluence in flushing poisons from the urinary tract, but also has an antiseptic action and assists in freeing the blood of
                        retained toxins. Believing as I do that so meritorious a product deserves the endorsement of the Medical Profession, I am
                        happy indeed to lend my name and photograph for your use in advertising Cystex." Signed W. R. George, M. D.</ab>

                        <ab>MEDICAL authorities now say that mil- lions of men over 40 suffer from dis- order of one of the most important male
                            glands--the prostate. After age 5O, says one important writer, the chances are 2 to 1 that you have some prostate
                            derangement.</ab>
                        <ab>This, gland disorder is seldom mentioned, by laymen, but millions will recognize the symptoms. When prostate "hypertrophy"
                            is present the victim, usually suffers broken sleep --he has to get up 2 to 10 times a night; he has other "bladder"
                            symptoms: frequently com- plains of aching feet, legs and back; and often suffers unexplained "blues" and loss of strength
                            and ambition.</ab>
                        <ab>If you are suffering from this gland weakness you should write at once for the sensational book "Why Many Men Are Old At
                            40." It is now being given away, free, by the institution which recently perfect a marvelously simple drugless relief for
                            this gland disorder. This method, called Thermalaid, has already been tested by over 100,000 men. Thousands upon thousands
                            have already written grateful letters describing their quick and often seemingly permanent relief from prostate
                            symptoms.</ab>
                        <ab>Do not hesitate. Send for this book now. You will also learn of a generous test offer now being made by the manufacturer
                            of Thermalaid, to prostate gland sufferers. This test will prove the merit of Thermalaid in seven days, or you pay

                    <ab> THE STORY SO FAR: Jan- ice Temple, out of a job, is returning to her home town when, on the train, she meets Roger Greville,
                        who has just been jilted by his fiancee, Gina Mornington. Hating to tell his father, who has never seen Gina, what has
                        happened, he persuades Janice to pose as his fiancee for a month. Roger's father has a stroke, and before he dies he begs
                        Roger to marry Janice. After the old man's death, Roger insists that they pretend that they are happily married. He also
                        forbids her to continue her friendship with Sefton Arlen, a neighbor friend. Roger and Janice become good friends, and Janice
                        hopes that Roger is learning to love her when Gina Mornington returns, determined to win Roger for herself. Roger comes down
                        with an attack of fever, and Janice is with him when he takes her in his arms and kisses her, telling her he loves her, but
                        calling her Gina.</ab>
