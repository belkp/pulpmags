He was in the cabin of a neighbor, Adam Livingston.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Death seemed inevitable, and Livingston did all in his power to relieve the physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffering of his guest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Came the dying man's request that Livingston get a spiritual adviser, a clergy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Livingston refused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The guest died, and from the time of that death, through many years that</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed, a series of portentous events colored the life of Adam Livingston that</seg><seg type="columnLine">only ended when he, himself--in terror and a nervous wreck--sought the aid of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized minister of the gospel and received what amounted to divine ameliora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Shortly after the stranger's death, horses are said to have been heard circling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Livingston house, the steady tread, tread of their hoofs jarring the nerves of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabitants. Dishes pitched from their shelves and were broken; pieces of coal</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang from the fire; a barn burned down; heads were cut from chickens--all with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no physical, human explanation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Next came sounds of the grinding of shears as they clipped. Suits of clothes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair from women's heads, shoes, curtains--all were clipped to shreds. This gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise to the "Wizard Clip" as the name of the Livingston ghost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Rumor declares that a woman, a skeptic, going to visit the Livingstons, had in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pocket of her dress a silk cap. She scoffed at the Livingston haunt--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when her cap was removed from her pocket, the cap was in shreds, plainly having</seg><seg type="columnLine">been clipped. But no one ever saw the shears or the wielder of the cutting blades.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  You never saw a ghost--you never touched a ghost--perhaps you never heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ghost. But how can you say that they don't exist? Beware of scoffing! Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ware--lest your clothes fall away in shreds, lest the haunt of horses' tramping</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoofs wreck your peace. Beware--lest scoffing bring upon you shattered nerves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a restless spirit, a craving for peace that can be satisfied nowhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg><seg type="columnLine">The SPECTER of Ihe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          IPhen Smith u?as made Deputy Police Commissioner</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          he neuer dreamed he mould be throu?n in touch with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE are a few hoary-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired, retired policemen</seg><seg type="columnLine">who once pounded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pavements of New York's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinatown, and who haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten the ghost of Tsing Lai</seg><seg type="columnLine">Low.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But if you encountered one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these and asked him for the story, he'd only wink know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly, shrug--then walk away without replying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As one of the leading actors in this thrilling drama, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps the weirdest that ever shook New York's yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter-- from the fan-tan rat holes behind the dingy shops</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the stinking opium dives in the catacombs beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roadways and ramshackle tenements--I am able to tell the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story--all of it.

This appointment came largely because of the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had held a government post in China for a few years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thereafter was supposed to possess an intimate knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of Celestials and their habits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My Asiatic experience had taught me that the harder a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man tries to pry into the secrets of the Orient, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more he realizes they are beyond his ken, but, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it didn't take me long to learn that opium, shipped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germany and Turkey, was being smuggled into Chinatown</seg><seg type="columnLine">in such quantities that the price had dropped from $150 a</seg><seg type="columnLine">can, to $80.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course we arrested and tried to pump many of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">known persistent smokers, the worst of the white and yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">driftwood. But, though we kept some of these in cells until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were half mad for a "drag at the dope," none would</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeal. Also, though we uncovered and closed up a few of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the joints, we never located sufficient of them to do any</seg><seg type="columnLine">good. And we couldn't get a line on how the stuff was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being smuggled in and who was distributing it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">■plNALLY I decided that the contraband was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought into the quarter in the early morning hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the streets were practically deserted and the uniformed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plain-clothes men on the night shift would be least</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchful. I made a surprise trip there around three o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">one morning and caught the men of the detail huddled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorways beyond the sweep of the winter wind. I read the</seg><seg type="columnLine">riot act. It's hard enough to catch a Chinese crook with</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody on the alert. With the police half asleep--good</seg><seg type="columnLine">night I After that I made it my business to slip into China-</seg><seg type="columnLine">town early each morning. The men were distinctly on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">jobs. But all reported, "Nothing doing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tliis went on for several days. Then came Sunday,</seg><seg type="columnLine">December 16th. It was two o'clock in the morning in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">raging snow storm when I swung from the Chatham Square</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"L" station. I had all but reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper west corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter, when a policeman whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">I recognized as Clancy, a veteran</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the section, came stumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward out of a tenement door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, lunging out wildly with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">club.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What the -" I began as he bumped into me. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">turned with a jerk, and his hand went up in salute. I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man was badly frightened, for his eyes fairly bulged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his jaws twitched as he tried to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, man. Be yourself," and I shook him roughly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's up?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God!" he gasped, then shot a frightened glance over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder toward the entry, where the door stood open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt certain Clancy wasn't doped or drunk. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the old reliables of the force, and anytlring which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given him such a jolt must be decidedly unusual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I just had the scare of my life, Chief," he added shame-</seg><seg type="columnLine">facedly, making an effort to recover his composure. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never saw a ghost before. But if I didn't see one in there,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">just 'fore you came along, I'll be-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you driving at?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"1 ISTEN, Chief. I'm telling you on the square. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipping along here looking for an unlocked door so's I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get in out of the storm for a few minutes. I stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the hall. I had just removed my coat to shake off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow, when I heard a sound, and looked up. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Tsing Lai Low--standing on the stairs! You know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fellow they call the Svise one.' I nearly took a flop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just as I was raising my club to give him a crack he sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly pointed up, then--just disappeared into the air, right</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">before my eyes and while the hall light was on him so's-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you lost your head, eh ?" I watched his expression</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">closely. "You're certain-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know what you're thinking, Chief. But I'm telling you</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight. I've known old Tsing for more'n twenty years</seg><seg type="columnLine">and couldn't be mistaken. But--well, I'll swear he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">go up stairs. And you know he didn't pass you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was about convinced that for once Clancy had yielded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hard liquor in the hope of warming his blood and it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone to his head. "We'll stop guessing and learn the truth,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I replied sharply. "Tsing's flat is on the third floor. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been there often. We'll go up there right now. Walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. No good waking up the whole tenement and bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing half a hundred Chinks around us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Obviously Clancy had seen something. No man, drunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">or sober, could have so counterfeited the fear that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown. And he had not known of my presence when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came stumbling from the tenement, striking at nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, though his story was too fanciful for me to swallow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wanted to make certain of Tsing's safety. For I con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered him a real friend. After I had established that fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would try to ascertain the foundation for the cop's hallu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cination. However, as my identity still was unknown to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the riff-raff of the quarter and must remain so if I were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By "John Smith"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">6Is lold to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jllan Uan Hoesen</seg><seg type="columnLine">1]ELL01P Quarter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">assigned to clean up trade in narcotics in Chinatown,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some unseen u^orld before his case could be settled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                  moan, came</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                  from some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                  where in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                  darkness be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                  yond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I found the elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tric button and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed it.

I closed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to accomplish anything, I cautioned him to say nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As we rounded the head of the stairway and turhed toward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the front I thought I caught a low groan, as of some one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in pain. A gasp behind me indicated that Clancy also had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heard. It was with taut muscles and heart pounding that I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hastened forward and grasped the door handle.

His house stood fifty feet or so from</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine. Seeing him on the Commuters' Special of a morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">regularly, and mowing his lawns of a Saturday afternoon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or comfortably reading his paper on his front porch of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunday morning, his wife at his side--I came to know a</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal, contented business man of thirty-five or so, happily</seg><seg type="columnLine">married, entirely satisfied with the placid routine that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his little world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IMAGINE my surprise, then, when he walked in on me like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this--looking like the wreck of the man I had grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed to see. His white collar, always spotless, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on one side, as if he had started to take it off and got</seg><seg type="columnLine">only half-way finished with the job. His hair was rumpled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hung down over his eyes. He was in his vest and shirt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeves, and baggy carpet slippers covered his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While I held the lighted match to his cigar, I did some</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid thinking. What could tliis mean? I knew the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">only slightly, and as a dignified, steady fellow. To see him</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking as he did, and in this upset state of mind--why, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have a lunatic on my hands. Plainly, my best plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to humor him--at least, until I could be on more</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now tell me," I said, making my voice as calm and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I could, "what is this that's pursuing you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, it's a frightful, clawing monster--it's nothing.

Outwardly I smiled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made myself appear cool and collected.

I didn't know whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not I should propound the doctrines of my belief to him--</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrate for him some of the demonstrations I had seen. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be at a complete loss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A present and vital need, as I could plainly see, was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the man in a calm frame of mind. While he talked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand had kept going to his head, his fingers combing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his hair. And instead of looking me in the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he spoke, he would glance at me, then stare at the book-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelves across the room, quickly find the corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mantel behind me with a swift glance, then show the whites</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his eyes in a nervous start as he focused his attention on</seg><seg type="columnLine">me again. So, I took a safe tack and trusted to developments</seg><seg type="columnLine">to guide me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me give you a viewpoint, old man," I said.

The name of this one has escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. He was a large, calm man, slow of speech and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trick of smiling quietly behind his thoughtful frown. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had told the people at the hospital to find the best surgeon</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the city, regardless of the cost, and this was the chap</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had routed out of bed at two in the morning. He put</seg><seg type="columnLine">a broad hand on my shoulder, peered intently into my face</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment, then backed me into a comfortable arm chair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as easily as I could have handled a child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit there," he commanded me, without a trace of resent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment in his voice. "You've been through a good deal to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. I know what it means." He paused, and his deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones sank to a whisper. "I lost my own daughter, last year.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If there is any hope, at all, your agitation will lessen it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Control yourself, man!

Just the three of us were in the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the doctor and the nurse. Sally, on the bed. was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like wax, and I could not see that she breathed. Norma,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her twin, sitting stiffly on a chair at the farther srde, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as still as her dying sister--as still, and nearly as pale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She gazed steadfastly at the face on the pillows, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">resemblance between them was so complete, so perfect even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the last detail of delicately chiseled nose and sweet, sensi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive mouth, that she might have been looking into a mirror.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And there was I, their father, and also their manager.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You have heard of the Gordon Twins? Perhaps you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen them? They were twenty-two, no more, when this</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened, yet they had danced their way around the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Most of the European courts, and many Oriental throne</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms had applauded them. Could you come to my home</seg><seg type="columnLine">some day, I could show you six books full of clippings--</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspaper and magazine notices, write-ups in theatrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">journals--no harsh words, but only praise, praise, praise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And they merited it all. I, their father, should know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Please forgive an old man's vanity in speaking of this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7 WAS their teacher before they acquired such skill that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could also be their manager. Did they learn first to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk or to dance? I can't remember. They were with me</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the stage when they were four, and to me it was as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spirit of their mother, who died in giving them birth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been dancing. They were her image, and the image</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each other. She, too, was a dancer. I have thought, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, that her soul passed to them when she died, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were bound to each other by a stronger tie than other</seg><seg type="columnLine">twins are. But you shall judge for yourself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Narrated by J. Paul Suter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of the last hurrying motor ride between cities through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness, I need not speak, save to tell its end. A sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn of the road, hidden by the blackness of the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">night until we were fairly upon it--a missing signal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning--to the left, a culvert--to the right, the road and</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety. Our speeding chauffeur swerved too late, and paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the error instantly, writh his life. Norma and I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">miraculously uninjured, not even rendered unconscious 'by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shock. But Sally .... When the distinguished surgeon</seg><seg type="columnLine">had examined her, his verdict was short and terrible:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To operate now would kill her. If she gains a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength, then I will operate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But will she live, Doctor--will she live?" I demanded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiercely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you believe in God?" was his reply, and when I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded-"Then pray!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was when I threatened him, frantically. But it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only some shallow surface layer of me which uttered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">threats. Deep in my heart I knew that this surgeon, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">eminent in his profession as my twins were in theirs, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not surrender while life remained. But I had seen enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hospitals to know something else, and I think it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">this knowledge which made me desperate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">U ERE were two of us in the little room who need not</seg><seg type="columnLine">L have been admitted. No one really was needed there ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept the doctor. Had there been any hope, Norma and I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have waited in the hall. The fact that we were there, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">challenged by the surgeon, proved that Death, too, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">by--Death, who withheld his hand through the few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">during which we hoped and prayed .... then struck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only a second or two before the end, consciousness</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to Sally, and she looked, not at me nor at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigilant, hovering doctor, but into her sister's eyes. I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them meet--those two pairs of. blue eyes. The glance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding which passed between them was so definite,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so palpable that it seemed almost a material thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did she say to you. Norma?" I demanded, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the instant that the surgeon bowed his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My other daughter--the only child I had left now--looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me, but did not answer. It was the doctor, instead, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke, to the nurse:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have them arrange for connecting rooms at a hotel,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he directed. "A taxi, too." He hesitated, and glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquiringly at me: "Or, if you prefer, you can both have</seg><seg type="columnLine">beds here. The accident has left you both uninjured, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the shock-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before I could decide. Norma took the thing out of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, speaking for the first time since the accident:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will go to the hotel," she said, quietly, but in a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which all color, all intonation, had fled. Then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked slowly from the room, with no backward glance, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">following mechanically. For the time, her will had assumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominance. I was dumb, unable to think.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I climbed into the taxi beside her. I had no word for</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone--none even for my old friend, Bertolli, manager of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the theatre in which we were to have danced the next night,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">20</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WOMAN WITH TWO SOULS	21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Surely death does not check the qrowth of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul so beautiful as Salhj Qordon's^and ycf-----</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">who awaited us with bowed head at the hotel. Bertolli had</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged for the accommodations. No detail remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">undone. I looked into his dark eyes filled with tears, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindly, rugged face, and looked away again. But Norma</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to him, and said something, rapidly and earnestly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bertolli started violently. I could catch neither his words</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor hers, but I thought--</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as thought was pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible for me -- that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed incredulous, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened. Norma was</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanding something. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was protesting. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">her way, however, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw him nod and shrug</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulders, then walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly from the hotel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she returned to me, her deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate face was as set and devoid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression as that of a marble statue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She followed the deeply concerned</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerk, who himself showed us to our rooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and 1 followed her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So much had happened to me in those last</seg><seg type="columnLine">few hours, cutting my very soul to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I no longer had the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply. I expected to lie awake, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly said</seg><seg type="columnLine">goodnight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norma and stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her room</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, I was forced back from oblivion. Someone</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spoken. The voice fell on my ear like the tinkle of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell, soft and musical, yet so commanding that even my</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep sleep was shattered. I sat up. The lights were still</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, as I had left them. Norma stood beside my bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was dressed in the black velvet suit of a page boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            the costume well.

Some of their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            other dances were more difficult, or more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            startling, but none exceeded that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            first one in grace. For convenience,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            they had always left our hotel clad</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                          "But will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                          the Jive,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                          Doctor --</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                          will ahe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                          live?"

The bed was soft and inviting. I flung myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it, without having undressed, and was soon asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before sleep engulfed me, I thought of Norma, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had kissed me goodnight--her beautiful face still cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stiff like marble, her voice hardly louder than silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself. She was numb, too. I remember being thankful for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, and wondering vaguely what terrible pangs would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come, when feeling returned to us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One other thing I wondered about. What message was</seg><seg type="columnLine">it that had passed between Norma and her sister--at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last? It was this thought that hovered insistently before</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind, just before I sank into unconsciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Jn their page cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumes, covered by long cloaks, though all the other clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the act were laid out for them with the theater properties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Are you ready, Father ?" she said, quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"For what?" I demanded, in bewilderment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"For the act. I'm afraid we're a little late. Isn't it lucky</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Bertolli's theater is only a few steps from the hotel?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's going to have things all ready for us, Father. I spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, and he promised. Ours is the only act to-night, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I stared at her, in utter dismay. So this was how feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">had returned! She thought--oh, my God, she thought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of them were to dance together, as usual. What could</seg><seg type="columnLine">22</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ghost Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I do? Should I remind her of the truth, or should I humor</seg><seg type="columnLine">her? Yet how could I humor her? Perhaps if I took her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the theatre and danced with her myself. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You talked with Bertolli-" I began, feeling blindly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for a way out; and to my amazement she laughed--her old,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinkling laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"llOU know I did, Father--you saw us. Mr. Bertolli prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ised to be there himself. Oh, I believe I forgot to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you! I forgot to tell my poor old padre, so he went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep while I was changing my clothes!" She patted my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, then threw both arms around my neck and kissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. "I'm sorry, Father--poor, tired Father! But you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">take me over to the theatre, won't you, and watch me</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the act ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stiffly, I led the way to the door. It was about four</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock in the morning. The hotel attaches who saw us</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass down the stairs to the lower hall and thence to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street, must have eyed us with wonder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for myself, I saw only the slender girl in the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloak, walking silently by my side. Somewhere I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned that when the mind has reached the limit of endur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance--when it totters on the brink, with black insanity</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead--all that it does must be accepted as a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, if the reason is to lie saved. Though I was not able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think clearly that night, this idea must have possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, for I took her through the deserted streets to the theater</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night quite as I might have done at any other time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bertolli's theater, like its proprietor, was one of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">oldest friends. Its associations reached far back into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own dancing days. It was Bertolli whose strong, quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathy, never intrusive but always to be relied on, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped me</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bereavement</seg><seg type="columnLine">when my little</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls were born</seg><seg type="columnLine">--at the cost of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their mother's</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. As chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren, they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced upon his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not cast our first bitter moments among strangers. Bertolli</seg><seg type="columnLine">was my friend, and a friend of wonderful insight. Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">my girl had spoken to him of this strange freak of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, I felt he would understand. He would help me save</seg><seg type="columnLine">her reason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was not surprised when the old man met us at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage entrance. He had been waiting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You still wish to dance, cara mia?" he asked Norma,</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly. "Then you will find all as it should be. The stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">is set. In your dressing room ate the costumes, as usual. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">other theaters you did your own unpacking, maybe, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bertolli always arranged everything--you remember? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, my old friend," he said, kissing me on the cheek, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Italian fashion. "--she will need your help in putting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the costumes. I will sit in the audience. To-night, I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">the audience!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I caught his meaning, when he referred to Norma's need-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my help. The girls had helped each other into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">more elaborate costumes. That saved time for both. I fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed Norma down the dimly lighted passage-way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressing room. But she stopped me at the door. Her blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, wide and inscrutable like those of a sleep walker,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked into mine, and she smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shan't need your help, Father. Sit with Mr. Bertolli."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rT-HAT night, she was in command. I could do nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but obey. My old friend, just behind, threw an arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">affectionately over my shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"A rehearsal in a darkened house!" he said, making an</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort to laugh. "It will be like that. We shall sit quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the front. I think that will be better. If she sees with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mind a house full of people, clapping, stamping with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their feet--bravo!--you and I, we shall not</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoil the picture. Come!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">             As we crossed the stage and descended by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           the little flight of steps at the side, I glanced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           about. Bertolli had done his part, indeed. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           stage was set for our act, just as he had set</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           it many times before. Deep red curtains hung</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           in the background, undulating even now with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                  stage, and his shrewd eye</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                  had detected faults for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                  me to correct before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they grew into habits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many times since, the old theater had welcomed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tripping feet, and had echoed back the applause of forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">audiences. Though fate had meted tragedy to us, she had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I cried out, and tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise, but Bertolli's iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand held me down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                the ripple of wind that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                sighed through the empty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                theater. In my day, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                had used black hangings,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                but years before, Norma</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                and Sally had suggested red. They were right.

Her lithe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ning of the act, but her hand, now lightly proffered into</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacancy, had then grasped another hand, and she had smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the up-tilted face of her sister, who had knelt gracefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one knee and returned her gaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "She is going to do the double dance!"

It was through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pages of "Hours With The Ghosts," a very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fine book in its period, written by my friend,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Henry Ridgely Evans. Through his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gentle and cynical style, I first learned the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">theory of spirit pictures and their makers--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the "mediums" of the camera.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It seemed that not everyone could take</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spirit photographs. One had to be psychic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In the vulgate, one must be a medium. If I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">used the same camera, the same plates, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">same studio, the same everything--nothing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would appear. There would be no ghosts on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the negative. That was because I was not a psychic. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all that was necessary, was the presence of the medium in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the room. His hand must press the little rubber bulb, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lo--a miracle! Ghosts would throng into the room and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some of them would impinge their likeness on the picture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That was the theory. My friend, Doctor Evans, went</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on to explain certain facts. He revealed the methods of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">double exposure, not so generally known when his book was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">24</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by which prepared plates could be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">devices employed by tricksters and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swindlers, to dupe the victims.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That was perhaps a quarter of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">century ago.

I had no desire to see my step-mother, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of my youthful unhappiness--the woman who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven me away from home. Still, 1 must sift this thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bottom. Then I had a bright idea. Why not spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few days in town incognito? I was quite sure no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">would recognize me. I had met half a dozen old-timers on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my way from the station and not one of them had cast me</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glance of recognition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Was you a particular friend of his?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 became suddenly aware that the little old lady's bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes had been regarding me steadily, with both interest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">compassion, and I made an effort to pull myselt together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," I said, slowly, "--in a sort of a way.

Couldn't you do the business</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her instead? I can give you her address."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--no thanks. She wouldn't do at all." I began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think fast. "How about that piece of land up by the lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Major Durham used to own? Was that sold?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, he sold that a couple of years before he died. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I might be able to put you in touch with the man who bought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it." Her face was all alight now and I could almost hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thoughts formulating behind that radiance. She would</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrange It for us both and perhaps there would be something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in it for her. Foxy little old girl I</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, perhaps I might be in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested--" I smiled at her re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuringly, "Meanwhile I'd like to find a place to stay for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few days, Do you know anyone In town who Utkes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarders and might be able to put me up?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A beatific smile greeted these words, and her excitement</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">simply refused to be suppressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, indeed, I know someone.

She made a futile</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ grab at my bags, but I forestalled her, and with a face</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreathed in smiles she lead the way into the house and</seg><seg type="columnLine">upstairs,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced hurriedly about, as I followed her, and noted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a pang, the decay and ruin that had come upon the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">home of my childhood. All that was fine, all that was of any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">value, seemed to have disappeared, and what remained of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">furnishings and fixtures were shabby and worn and dingy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had reached the upper floor, now, and suddenly the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little woman--"Miss Southwick" she told me was her name</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--stopped before a door.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more than the desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn of my father's af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairs that sent me hurry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down the street and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through that familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">front gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The house had changed surprisingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">little in fifteen years, I noted as I rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bell.

The same fragile loveliness, but with a maturity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an added poise.

And she was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gad. what a fool I had been! Why, she was perfect--</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply perfect!

In one swift moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">the years had rolled back like a film, baring all the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotions, the old longings, the old thrill her presence had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never failed to bring me. Buried there in the dust of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found my love for Ruth as fresh, as alive, as blooming,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it had ever been.

I should hardly have recognized him, so com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely had the years changed his appearance, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite evident that he did not recognize me. He greeted me</seg><seg type="columnLine">cordially, and we began to talk about the land, but my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused to lend itself to the subject. Somehow the advent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ruth seemed to have dulled it to everything else, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and again I found myself absent-mindedly answering</seg><seg type="columnLine">some remark of his without in the least knowing what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was talking about. Finally he suggested that he drive me</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to the lake to look things over, and I gladly accepted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the offer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       As he went back to get the car, I made a desperate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     effort to pull myself together.

By the time the car rolled up to the door</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     I had myself fairly well in hand.

For those not familiar with the case,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will state briefly wherein Doctor Grey (I call myself by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this name, in this narrative, although known to the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">by another name), a prominent Los Angeles dentist, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed to have murdered his wife by administering gas--</seg><seg type="columnLine">as used by the profession in the method of extracting teeth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was the hint of a scandal between the said Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey and his assistant, whom I will call Grace Turner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It all came about by my attending a spiritist seance in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hollywood. Being of a sensitive nature--one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">humans endowed with something akin to the mysteries--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sooti became an interested student of the occult. As I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">blessed with a clientele far larger than my fondest ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectations, the occult afforded me a form of relaxation from</seg><seg type="columnLine">office hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On this particular night I was attending a seance. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompanied by my wife. The hostess of the evening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">(there was to he a party followed by a seance conducted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a celebrated English medium) introduced my wife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself to a Dr. Ralston, who was quite an adept in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">study of mysticism or occultism, whichever you prefer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">call it. It seems he had spent considerable time in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Orient, mastering mysteries of the Far East.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dr. Ralston was several years my junior, of athletic build,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I am anything but athletic. He had delicately chiseled</seg><seg type="columnLine">features--almost effeminate. I noticed his lips were very</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin. They somehow gave me the impression of a brutal</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruelty, well hidden by the veneer and polish attained</seg><seg type="columnLine">through much travel and contact with many types of people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man had that masterful self-possession which so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">strive to attain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I learned that he was a new-comer to the State of Cali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fornia, a dentist by profession, and looking for a suitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">location. He was perfectly at home with the ladies and</seg><seg type="columnLine">held them spellbound with his thrilling accounts of his ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periences in the Orient and elsewhere, in his study of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">occult. I noted too, with annoyance, that he paid my wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite a bit of attention at the seance. No one else seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to notice it. however, and I soon forgot it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few days later while passing a suite of rooms in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same building in which my office was located, I was greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised to see Dr. Ralston's name printed in large gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">letters on the door next to mine, I knew that the rooms had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been vacant a short while, but it never entered my mind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all the office buildings in Los Angeles with offices avail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, that Dr. Ralston would choose the building in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was located.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the course of time we became quite friendly, since I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was broadminded enough not to be jealous of my competitor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we had many things in common. He belonged to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same lodges, clubs, etc., that I belonged to. And beside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wife was even more interested in spiritualism than I was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and enjoyed hearing Dr. Ralston relate his many experiences</seg><seg type="columnLine">--especially those dealing with the astral plane and soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">flights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus entered the snake into the Garden of Eden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He became a frequent visitor to our home.

As I am light on my feet for a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my weight, I approached the house almost silently, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to enter when I heard voices.

All through his siege of love-making,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wife kept trying to quiet him, assuring him every so</seg><seg type="columnLine">often that she loved me only, and could never love another</seg><seg type="columnLine">man as long as I remained alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg><seg type="columnLine">30</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ghost Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">To make tilings worse, however, and to bring matters to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, shortly after this happening, my assistant, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been with me ever since I had opened the office, decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get married to a meal ticket she had found out in Holly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood, and I was forced to get a new girl.

Of course my wife did not believe him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. he began planning in earnest for my destruction, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed if I was out of the way he would have no trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">in winning my wife, who was a wealthy woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I should mention here that all along the doctor was pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessing his friendship for me.

There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not many British settlers in those days. This chap called</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself Forber--Gerald Forber. His real name, I dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered. was very different. He had been in the Congo at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one time and various other parts of Africa. He claimed to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">know every race and tribe on the Continent, and could</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle the black man better than anyone else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Forber certainly had an uncanny power over the natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">who worked for him.

He was not liked and I confess I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not take to the fellow.

He drank a great deal. I noticed. I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself wondering why I had accepted Forber's invitation</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stay with him on my way back.

"Thanks for coming,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said hoarsely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a curious musty smell in the room that I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">very unpleasant.

"It's as if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come back. It is six months</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-night since we buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.

He endeavored to rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, to cry out, but his voice failed him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not move his limbs. He saw that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife was possessed of a devil and primitive horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened on his tired brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He made dreadful grimaces and squirmed about</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the sheets, but his wife was relentless.

I only hope you won't return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunt me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Hazlitt choked and fainted. He did not regain</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness but later he watched his body being</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared for burial, and amused himself by thinking that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife would soon regret her vileness. "I shall show</seg><seg type="columnLine">her what a ghost can do!" he reflected grimly. "I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay her for this!

I glanced quickly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage. The curtains of the frame were</seg><seg type="columnLine">parting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Roman scene was on. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">following the act through without omit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting a detail. In this scene, two glad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iators with swords and shields--very</seg><seg type="columnLine">light swords and shields!--had charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and counter-charged, threatened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fled about the stage. Never again would</seg><seg type="columnLine">there be two! That thought stabbed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">through like steel, but I bit my lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I could taste the blood, and kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent. If this was the price of sanity</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her, this play-acting that wrenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">my very heartstrings because of its sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestion of other days, then I must pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">the price. I did not even hide my eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Bertolli. I watched her dance</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the whole of the complicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene, exactly as she had done in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">days irrevocably gone, when Sally danced</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite. But now, no one danced</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The mock duel ended, as had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous scene, in the picture frame.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This dance depicted a fight to the death</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the "Dying Gladiator" story. Norma,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one who was to die, pressed both</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands to her breast at last, and slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank to the miniature stage. As her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand drooped and the closing curtains</seg><seg type="columnLine">hid her, I thought poignantly of another</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure in armor, sword held aloft and</seg><seg type="columnLine">face exulting in victory, whose presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have completed the picture. Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norma, too, thinking of her? I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. I could not understand what</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange fancies found place in that bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shiver went through Bertolli's stout</seg><seg type="columnLine">body as the curtains came together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great blotches of sweat stood out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dio mio, grant that it may be over 1"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he groaned, thickly.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I could find words to calm his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange agitation, he pulled himself to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, with an attempt at a smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What foolishness is this I say? We</seg><seg type="columnLine">can not go. We will not go. It is her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind that is at stake. We do our part</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we look and are silent. Ah! God in</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaven, it comes again!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE was trembling, and, with the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, his teeth chattered. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength, the self-control, seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have passed to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steady, Bcrtolli!" I urged, uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciously using the very word with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had held me together, a few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. But he continued to quiver and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to mutter to himself throughout the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance. My eyes quickly left him. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching, with a heavy heart, the grace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful figure of my little girl. This last</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene had been a love passage of "Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York." Sally (swain) had pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her advances, at first timidly then with</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater assurance as the climax of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">act was reached, on Norma, the slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">old-fashioned girl in flounced skirt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonnet. So alike were they that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roles could have been reversed, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am sure none of the audience would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I watched my old-fashioned girl now</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip through the graceful movements,</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancing, retreating, running away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing face over her shoulder--yield-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at last. In that finale--again staged</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the broad picture frame--she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lean backward, supported by her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sister's arms. I wondered how Norma</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do this. Some of the other move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments had seemed almost impossible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">one dancer alone, yet she had not varied</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from the standard of the act.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ah, how I knew that act I If she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed it in the slightest, I could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">detected the difference. She had changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing, yet now she would have to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. Not even her flexible muscles could</seg><seg type="columnLine">take that position unsupported. I waited.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She leaned backward--backward--farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">--yet farther, a smile on her face. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried out, and tried to rise, but Bertolli s</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron hand held me down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then my eyes were opened, and I saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There were two dancers. My little</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl was supported by a ghost figure--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the figure of Sally!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With staring eyes and pounding heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">I looked at them--but only for the space</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a breath--then the curtains of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame closed. A moment later, Norma,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still in the dress of "Old New York,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped down to the stage, looked about</seg><seg type="columnLine">her wonderingly, then flung herself weep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upon the hard boards--and I forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">my fear--forgot everything except that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she needed me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I ran faster to her than Bertolli; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard him exclaiming, as he lumbered</seg><seg type="columnLine">after me:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"She has found tears! To the good</seg><seg type="columnLine">God give thanks! She has found tears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her mind--it is saved!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not until she was calmer, and softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeping in my arms, did I know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the past hour was gone from her. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">curtain of her memory had been rung</seg><seg type="columnLine">down when something had passed to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her dying sister's eyes. It did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise again until she found herself, bitter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly weeping, upon Bertolli's stage. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had done that night was to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank, forever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO years later, Norma and I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Bertolli's with another act. I my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self was her dancing partner, but I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">little to do. For in that short time, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become the greatest of them all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palvini--Premier Danseuse of the age!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You will recognize the name, I know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is the one she took when she began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dance alone. To me, however, she is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the great Palvini, but my Norma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the first night of this engagement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bertolli and I sat in his little office at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the theater, and talked of the days that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gone. It is a good place in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to recall such things, this dingy room</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Bertolli's, yellow with age and mel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed with tobacco smoke, for the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">are covered from floor to ceiling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures out of the past. I think anyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">of note who has ever trod that stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">has something there: a photograph, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps, or a letter in faded ink; or, it may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, only a sere and torn scrap of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">program, with a name on it. Our pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture hangs directly over Bertolli's desk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girls in their page costumes, I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind them, one hand on the shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night, Bertolli leaned back in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, and a shadow crossed his wrinkled</seg><seg type="columnLine">face as he looked through the clouds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own tobacco smoke, at the picture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a long life filled with many won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful experiences, that was the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful," he said, solemnly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I knew what he was thinking of.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The memory of that dance came back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, and I looked away for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a lump in my throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did she ever remember it?" he asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shook my head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yet she was completely cured? There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no--what shall I call it?--no break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down of the mind?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could answer him emphatically on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"She showed normal grief--nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">more," I assured him. Then the feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what I owed the man came to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bertolli, you were right.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would force a confession from her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if necessary he would choke the breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her abominable body.

She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> was no longer able to speak, but her eyes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> cried out in pain. . . . The stranger at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> length succeeded in aiding her. He got</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> her to her feet, but Hazlitt refused to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> be discouraged. The stranger's opposi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tion exasperated him and he redoubled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> his efforts.

He had ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> pended all his strength and still the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> woman breathed. A convulsion of baf-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fled rage distorted his angular frame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew that he would be obliged to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> go away and leave the woman to her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lover.

"I can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> breathe more easily now. It is you who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> have given me courage, my darling."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The stranger was bewildered and hor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> rified. "I can't understand what's got</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> into you," he murmured. "I don't see</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> anything. You are becoming hysterical.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Your nerves are all shattered to pieces."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hazlitt's wife shook her head and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> color returned to her cheeks. "It was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> awful, dearest. You cannot know how</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And, help was forthcoming.

You see? For the first time, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">your Norma was complete--if I may call</seg><seg type="columnLine">it that. They had been mutually de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendent : now she depended on no one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cord was cut which held her back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from greatness. That is how I explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, but it is only my surmise. I am not</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She was my daughter," I cried, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sharpening of the old grief I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought long buried. "Why could I not</seg><seg type="columnLine">see her from the first? Why was she</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden from my eyes until you touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">me ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man shrugged his shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who shall answer that, my friend?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who shall say why so few of us ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">see into the reality of the great mystery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life that surrounds us? And why are</seg><seg type="columnLine">they who have sight given a glimpse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it so seldom?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shook my head.

Despair</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched at his heart. "A futile ghost,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he groaned. "A futile, weak ghost 1 I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't punish a fly.

But, with all their materia! pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perity, the Huntington home had lacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one thing to make it complete--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">One had come--a little boy. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been taken away before a year had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed. There had been no other. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, though childless, Archer and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife had loved children with a passion</seg><seg type="columnLine">which surpassed all other interests for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Their home always was the play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground for the little ones of their rela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives and friends. And Dolly, despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frail, little body which made her al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most an invalid, went about daily into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the homes along the waterfront looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the needs of the children of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poorer families.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Archer backed her splendidly in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts. But his big days came with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">boy before Hazlitt made up his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to act.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He left the sidewalk in a bound and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran directly towards the automobile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He reached it a second before it touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the child, and with a great shove he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent the near-victim sprawling into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">zone of safety. But he could not save</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. The fender of the car struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">him violently in the chest; he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown forward, and the rear wheels</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed over his body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment lie suffered exquisite</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain; a great weight pressed the breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his thin body. He clenched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, and closed his eyes. The pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this second death astonished him; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed interminable. But at length con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness left him; his pain dissolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a healing oblivion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE child picked himself up and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to cry. "Someone pushed me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he moaned. "I was looking at the lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">and someone pushed me from behind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman in the car was very pale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I think I ran over someone," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakly. "I saw him for a moment when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tried to turn to the left. lie was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin and worn." She turned to those</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Christmas, when he could gather chi!</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren about him to his heart's content.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The day before Christmas, in an old hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">far down in the Bowery, he held open</seg><seg type="columnLine">house for the youngsters of the city's</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor, where there was a gigantic tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">ablaze with colored candles and long</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables, heaped high with goodies; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice cream and candy to follow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, it was after the feast when</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Archer was truly in his element.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For then, clad in scarlet cap and fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trimmed coat, with shining boots that</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached almost to his hips, he played</seg><seg type="columnLine">Santa Claus, heaping toys into the arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each eager child as it filed past him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he looked the part. For he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">short and stout, with a waistline that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched the belt about his gaily colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">doublet. And framing his laughing eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ruddy cheeks was a mass of snowy</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiskers that made artificial disguise</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnecessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the evening, in his great stone man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion just off the avenue, there would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">another celebration--a splendid Christ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mas Eve party, to which would flock</seg><seg type="columnLine">the children of his friends. And again</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would play Saint Nick, and help</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy Dolly distribute the creams and</seg><seg type="columnLine">favors and pass about the presents, taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a glittering tree, with each little</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's name written upon the wrapper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And it was at Santa Claus Hunting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's that I attended my first Christmas</seg><seg type="columnLine">party. I was an excited, wide-eyed little</seg><seg type="columnLine">miss whose great hope was fulfilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Santa Claus Huntington himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave me a big doll with flaxen hair that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could say "mamma."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HOWEVER, that was my only party</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. For, the following summer</seg><seg type="columnLine">Archer and his wife steamed away in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">&gt;acht for port&lt; in the South Seas, where</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">who had gathered near. "Where did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you carry him to?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They shook their heads. "We didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see anyone, madam! You nearly got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kid though.

"What's all this about?" he asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Is anyone run over?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman shook her head. "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know.

He advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the crowd and began dispersing them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his club.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The woman in the car leaned over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked at the sidewalk, a puzzled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystified expression on her pale fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No blood or anything," she moaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I can't understand it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it was hoped the warmer breezes would</seg><seg type="columnLine">restore the roses to Dolly's cheeks. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yacht never reached its destination.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And though my father, Archer's life-long</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend and business associate, conducted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a world-wide search for it, neither the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat nor its passengers were ever heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My father, as well as others of Archer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">intimates, knew that, somewhere in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, he always kept a considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">store of ready cash for emergencies--</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as his own and Dolly's charities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or to aid less prosperous friends in need</seg><seg type="columnLine">of loans, for which no papers would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed or interest exacted. This hiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, known only to him, was hunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">for repeatedly, but never uncovered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then followed long years in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old house remained closed and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows boarded up. The neighborhood</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed. Ugly business structures el-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed their way in. Workmen de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended upon the old houses that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained, altering them inside and out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividing the great rooms into smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones--making them over into beehives</seg><seg type="columnLine">for humans. And into these tenements</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved those who were compelled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">count their pennies--the overflow of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor from Five Points, Hell's Kitchen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mulberry Bend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally the Huntington estate was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed of. My father purchased the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, hoping, for sentimental reasons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rent it as it stood, thereby preserving</seg><seg type="columnLine">its outward appearance at least. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had failed in that objective. No one</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted a whole house in that teeming</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenement district. So, though my father</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued his ownership, he permitted it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like its neighbors, to be rebuilt into</seg><seg type="columnLine">small flats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In those years my mother had died,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving only me to care for Dad.

And 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">was determined he should fare as splen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">didly as any boy in all New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My final errand was to a neighbor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood department store, where the weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerks already were preparing to close.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am going to leave all choice to you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said to a man behind the nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter.

Even Archer Huntington, if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were looking down upon me, must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled at my effort to follow in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">footsteps. For, somthow, I seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel that he was responsible for the joy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of giving, which I always had known</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Christmas time.

"Merry Christmas, boys.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wait here until I come back. I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make certain Johnny is asleep. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can take the gifts to his mother." I</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried only the coat, which was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">my personal gift to Bridget Kelly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I entered the hallway I encoun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the janitress, reaching aloft to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn the sputtering gas flame to a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">speck, the customary illumination for</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of the tenements who returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">home after midnight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She pushed her spectacles closer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes, then, "And can it be yourself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Gregory?

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened. No sound came from within.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And but the tiniest chink of light shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the second door, which I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened directly upon the kitchen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">living room. Johnny slept there. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">it kept him near the big stove, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplied all the heat for the diminutive</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On tip-toe I moved to the other door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one to the narrow inner hallway. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the knob gently, entered without</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound and closed it behind me. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">place was fearsomely still. But, as 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened. I caught the faint, regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing of a child. Johnny was asleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I moved to the doorway of the kitchen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A lamp burned upon a table, placed so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that its rays fell upon the boy's bed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably to give him courage to remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone while his mother was absent upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her errand of mercy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then my eyes wandered about and</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the shadows, to the stove and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the old mantel behind it. A lump came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into my throat as I noted the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">stocking hanging there. Johnny's stock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, waiting to be filled by Santa Claus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poor little laddie. And I had almost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">forgotten him. No Santa would come</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the Kelly flat. But there would be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gifts aplenty--more than Johnny possi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bly could have dreamed of possessing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  No need to wait for the return of Mrs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Kelly.

And we would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">move quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was about to turn back into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hallway when suddenly, with a gasp of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fright, Johnny sat straight up in bed and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stared before him, toward the stove, witt&gt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wide eyes, his mouth agape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">T TURNED and looked, where he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I* gazing. And my whole body went</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">numb and I leaned against the casement,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">half dazed, at what I saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For, standing atop the stove--stood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Santa Claus--as I had seen him pictured</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--thousands of times--smiling, eyes shin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing, a wide belt holding his fur trimmed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">jacket close to his fat, round stomach</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and high boots coining far up over his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">short legs. Only his pack of toys was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">missing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, as I gazed, as speechless as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Johnny, the feeling of fear slipped from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of the top, fully a foot in length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dropped and was hanging. I stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer. The piece was held by a hinge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunningly set into the wall. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposed top of the upright showed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening.

I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good sleight-of-hand performer myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I didn't like to think I could be so</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily duped.

If</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is disappointing to the reader that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot disclose it here, I am deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry, but I try to be fair in dealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with spirit mediums, no matter how I</seg><seg type="columnLine">may suspect them. I cannot swear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hypothesis is correct. I merely as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sert that I have found a simple, an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceedingly simple hypothesis which does</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit the facts, and by which I can dupli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate the surprising portraits made in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Rushmore's studio. And I chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenge Doctor Rushmore to give me an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other sitting. If I cannot detect him, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall publicly announce my defeat. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I do detect him, he is to admit pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">licly that I have found him out.

Why, perhaps-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But aside from the slight deepening</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her color, she gave no sign that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed, and replied, quite calmly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr.--Evans--and I have already met."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, of course, of course. You let</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in, didn't you?

She smiled at me</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, little imps of mischief dancing be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind her eyes. So she had noted my</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion--thought I was some city guy</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had fallen in love with her 011 sight?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, that was all right too. I'd woo</seg><seg type="columnLine">her first, and then tell her who I was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MRS.

He seemed to feel, and right-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, that my step-mother was responsible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for my disappearance, and there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">many bitter quarrels between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN one day my step-mother packed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her things and went back West to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her old home.

But the two old men paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">little attention to her and at last she</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmed down and demanded that the will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be read. But there seemed to be no will,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as there was no one to dispute her</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, she automatically inherited what</seg><seg type="columnLine">property there was--only the house and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small amount of money in the savings</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN order to live she had to rent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house and take the Stoner shack for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own abode, and the catastrophe had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been almost too much for her. Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">any too pleasant, she had developed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a veritable shrew, and few people would</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tisk association with her. So there she</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived, alone, bitter, almost an outcast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indeed some people even went so far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to say she had become slightly de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Ruth unfolded this story to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feelings can well be imagined. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">only I had known, how different I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made things for my father, during</seg><seg type="columnLine">his last years! I might at least have</seg><seg type="columnLine">communicated with him, I told myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">wretchedly, but I had been very bitter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I had not known he cared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You couldn't be expected to know,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said softly. "You mustn't blame</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself too severely."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 took her hand in mine, and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">awhile we continued our walk in silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is he buried here?" I asked. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reached the old cemetery in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">ny mother lay sleeping. Ruth nodded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">_ pushed open the gate and we entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knew the spot well. After mother's</seg><seg type="columnLine">death I had come there often, gaining a</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure of comfort from the simple rite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of decorating her grave with flowers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in spite of the dark, I was able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead the way to the family plot. As we</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached it, I thought I saw some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing move, and at the same instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruth's grip on my arm tightened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you see someone?" I whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ye--es.'' She tried to answer bravely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but her voice quavered and I could feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">her body trembling as she came closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yon wait here and I'll investigate,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I whispered, but she clung to me in ter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ror and at last we both advanced to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the spot, silently, cautiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we drew near, I could make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outlines of a white figure flitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, and for an instant all the stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had ever heard about ghosts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave yards raced crazily through my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. Then reason reasserted itself, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I managed to get myself in hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Good Lord! There were no ghosts!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was acting like an idiot! This was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of flesh and blood and I must find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out who it was and what it was doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. I loosened Ruth's terrified hold on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my arm and whispered, "Stand right</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. Don't move. I'm going to take it</seg><seg type="columnLine">by surprise," and Ruth, too scared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterance, did as I told her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly I advanced on the thing, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, spying me apparently for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time, it turned and fled. I followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in full pursuit and finally, sensing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was gaining on it, it turned and charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">back at me, and for a wild moment I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought the impulse to run from it. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">something bigger than I, kept me rooted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the spot, and as it came at me, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened my arms and caught hold of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly. There was a moment of fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle, then it crumpled up in my arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lay there panting and gasping. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered it to the ground and quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck a match. At that moment Ruth</seg><seg type="columnLine">came rushing up to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ralph! You're all right? Oh, thank</seg><seg type="columnLine">God!" Then seeing the figure crumpled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my feet she gave a little gasp.

What I saw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled me with both disgust and pity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was she all right--a moth-eaten cari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cature of her former self. Her whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">body had shrunk, her hair was tangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unkempt and gray, her light clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung about her in tatters, but the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">features were there--the beak of a nose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cruel mouth, the receding chin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her eyes were closed and she seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be unconscious, as she lay there in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huddled heap. The match flickered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went out. There was a sudden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift movement in the darkness, and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore we could grasp what was happen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, she had darted up and away. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made as though to follow her, but Ruth</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid a detaining hand on my arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let her go, Ralph. She's harmless--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and probably scared to death,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And of course she was right. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow the old woman? I wanted noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of her.

A shadowy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  form was rising--rising out of the earth 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then, instantly, a great calm took pos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  session of me, and I found myself mov-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ing as one in a dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     "Father 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I would have known him anywhere,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  in spite of the gray hair, the bent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  shoulders.

Then a beautiful smile spread</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  1 e ver his countenance and his fine eyes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  fairly poured forth love and tenderness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    "Father!" I took another step toward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  him/ and at that instant a strange light</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  came from over my shoulder, lighting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  up the figure in the weirdest manner,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  and 1 saw a luminous, glittering mass,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  as though a million tiny stars were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  lodged there. With a sudden, swift mo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  tion, he reached inside his coat, then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I advanced toward me, the luminous sub-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  stance in his outstretched hand. At that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  moment the spell was broken by a cry</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  from Ruth, and as I turned toward her,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  the figure of my father began to dissolve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  FOR the next few moments my atten-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  tion was centered on Ruth who had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  fallen to the ground in a quivering heap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was some time before I could calm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  her. In sheer desperation I finally told</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  her that she really had been mistaken,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  that her nerves were badly unstrung,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  that there had been no ghost, no pres-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ence save what her own fevered imagin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ation had pictured. But, when I had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  taken her home, and had left her with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  understanding that on the morrow I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  would call upon her parents and reveal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  my identity to them, I found that I too,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  was unnerved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    This thing was uncanny. Yet, we had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  both seen the thing, hadn't we? It was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  really my father--not a doubt about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  that!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     After I got into bed I lay there trying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   to figure it out. Surely I had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   wrong. My step-mother's presence in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   graveyard had made us excited. We had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   imagined the rest. It was with this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   thought on my mind that I finally</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   dropped off to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    IVl I sat up in bed and peered into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  the darkness. Had a voice actually</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  called me, or was it a dream? At first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  nothing was visible; then I felt again</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  that unearthly, icy wind, and heard a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  slight rustling sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Father?" The word came from me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  almost unconsciously, and I had no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  sooner uttered it than he stood before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  me. quite bright in the darkness, with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that strange glitter over his heart more</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiant, more dazzling than before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long moment he stood gazing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, then slowly he raised his arm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beckoned, and, like one in a dream, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose and followed. Down the length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room he led me. Then, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached my old book-case beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window, he seemed to vanish straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the wall. I was left standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the darkness, dazed, baffled, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken.	--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What could it mean? I continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand there for some time in a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupor, then slowly I made my way back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bed. What did it all mean? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was evidently trying to tell me some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing--but what?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I must have fallen asleep again, for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once more I awakened with the distinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression that my name had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">called. Yes--there he was again! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked distressed, this time, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">beckoned me more emphatically than be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore. Again I arose and followed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the book-case. This time he pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it meaningly, and again he vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt around for the electric switch--</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned it on. This thing was queer. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would get to the bottom of this I I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and carefully examined the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">book-case. It was empty of all save a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few books, relics of my school days</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no one had seen fit to remove. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one I took them out, thumbed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">their pages and shook out any loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers they contained. Nothing of im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portance. Only bits of scratch paper--</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes made at school. Then, suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a flash, I remembered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sliding panel . . . how could I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have forgotten!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly I pulled the book-case from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall and groped about for the spring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yes, it was still there! I pressed it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with beating heart watched,, for per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps the hundredth time, the noiseless</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliding back of the panel, the disclosure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that yawning cavity beyond. Built</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the original owner of the house, prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably to lodge a safe or something of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort, this place of concealment had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways fired my youthful imagination with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its thrilling possibilities. Many a time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a kid, I had hidden my most cher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished possessions there, away from pry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing eyes. That anyone else knew of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence, I never for a moment dreamed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I realized now that father must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known of it from the start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I struck a match and thrust it inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opening and in the flickering light</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw that the space was empty save for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flat package that lay on the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath a heavy coating of dust. I lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">this out eagerly, my heart pounding with</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement. It was a thick envelope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing Judge Wyckham's name in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner and addressed to me in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">father's well-known writing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I opened it, and with trembling fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">I drew out a long legal document--my</seg><seg type="columnLine">father's last will and testament. Swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eye scanned the closely written sheet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I started at the beginning. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">I read there astounded me! Especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, in view of what had happened this</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently my father was determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my step-mother should have none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his money. He wanted me to have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it, but in the event that I never re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, it was to just disappear from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth. He had conceived the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of turning everything he owned into</seg><seg type="columnLine">cash, and then converting that cash into</seg><seg type="columnLine">--diamonds! Judge Wyckham, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointed his executor, was instructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to conceal these diamonds in a secret,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside pocket of father's coat, over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, just before his burial--and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make sure they were buried with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the event of my return, I was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the necessary court order to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body dug up, and claim my fortune.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If I never appeared, the stones were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain forever buried with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There followed a description of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret cupboard in my room, in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the judge was instructed to place the</seg><seg type="columnLine">will against my return. A truly remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able document. Apparently the judge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">had carried out his instructions to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter, for I had not the slightest doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the glittering mass apparent over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart of my father's ghost, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually the fortune in diamonds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole thing was so uncanny, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird, that for a little while I sat there</seg><seg type="columnLine">as one stupified. This thing defied all</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical laws, and yet--it had happened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I examined the signatures of the wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesses. Dr. Nevins was one and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other was Samuel Higgins, Ruth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">father! He, then, had known of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">will, too, and had never told Ruth--or,</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably, anyone else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was broad daylight now and I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to dress. Since I had planned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell Ruth's parents that morning, who I</seg><seg type="columnLine">really was, I decided to go right over</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and take the will with me. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Higgins would advise me what steps to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take. Accordingly, immediately after</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast I walked over to Ruth's house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found ^Ir. Higgins out watering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawn. He greeted me cordially.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well, Mr. Evans, and how are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">this morning? Slept well, I hope."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, thanks. And you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never better."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Mr. Higgins--I wonder if I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">see you alone for a few moments?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why--certainly. Wait 'til I shut this</seg><seg type="columnLine">off and I'll be right with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned off the faucet and led the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way into his library.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, sir, what can I do for you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took the will from my pocket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid it on the table before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've seen this before, Mr. Hig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gins ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He picked it up and glanced at it</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously, then recognizing it, his whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude stiffened to attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Major Durham's will! What does</seg><seg type="columnLine">this mean, sir?" He regarded me in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I found it--where my father had it</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His face paled. "Then you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"George Evans? No--I'm Ralph Dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He scrutinized my face closely. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that he was trying to recon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cile my present personality with that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy he had last seen fifteen years</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. At last I saw by his face that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was convinced, but he pretended to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">skeptical for awhile longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you prove that?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ghost Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course. I have plenty of creden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tials." Then I grinned. "You might</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask Ruth. She recognized me imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately last night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His face softened and he came around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table with outstretched hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ruth would know," he said huskily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment we stood, hands clasped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching each other's faces, and each</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed satisfied with what he saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've kept her waiting a long time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">young fellow," he said finally. "But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was either you, or no one, with Ruth."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I know. She's a wonderful girl, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Higgins--much too good for me. If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't do everything in my power to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to her for those years of waiting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from now on, I hope you'll come gunning</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I promise you I will." We both</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed a bit shakily, coughed, blew our</seg><seg type="columnLine">noses, and then settled down to discuss</seg><seg type="columnLine">the will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE told me of being called in to wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness it, a short time before father's</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. "Mainly, I think," he said, "be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause I was Ruth's father. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty fond of Ruth, the Major, and it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was the dream of his life that some day</seg><seg type="columnLine">you would return and marry her. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't want to raise any false hopes, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked me to say nothing to her about</seg><seg type="columnLine">this will--and I never have.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In fact," he added, "I don't suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone but just those actually concerned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in drawing it up, knows about the mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. It'll be a nine days wonder in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">town when the truth becomes known!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">We sat there in silence for awhile, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dr. Nevins died shortly after your</seg><seg type="columnLine">father. The judge is still on circuit, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ought to be blowing in here one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these days pretty soon. You'd better</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick around 'til he gets home, and he'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">fix everything up for you in short order.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Always fond of you, the judge was. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way, when do you and Ruth figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get married?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We haven't talked about a date.

Judge Wyckham re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned sooner than we expected and set</seg><seg type="columnLine">in motion the legal machinery necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">to secure me my fortune. As Mr. Hig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gins predicted, my return was the talk</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the town for many days, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't stopped talking yet of the ec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centric Major Durham and his diamonds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My step-mother, who was out of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, we took care of until her death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which occurred a short time after our</seg><seg type="columnLine">marriage. Little Mrs. Southwick, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the credit for bringing the Higgins</seg><seg type="columnLine">family and me together again, has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">made happy beyond her fondest dreams.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gave her the old homestead as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I've never told Ruth or anyone else</seg><seg type="columnLine">the true story of how I found my father's</seg><seg type="columnLine">will.

It was on the day of my marriage</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Ruth. The minister was pronouncing</seg><seg type="columnLine">us man and wife, there in a little church</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had attended as children, and, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced up at the bank of lillies about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, once more I saw it, faintly, but dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinctly--that kind old face of my father,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now smiling and happy. I knew then</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was content.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I might add that Ruth and I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">found great happiness since that day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They Ranged a Phantom For Murder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                 (Continued from page 31)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">them together--and also to prevent any</seg><seg type="columnLine">fraudulent phenomena.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two young people began passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the slates at random to various per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons in the hall. It seemed almost a co-</seg><seg type="columnLine">incidence that the doctor and I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">each receive a pair. The doctor's slate</seg><seg type="columnLine">had one piece of white chalk on it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took the pair of slates given me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and examined them. They were one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pair the doctor had brought for us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had the three screws, which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">screwed down as firmly as when we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed them on the table. My pair con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained no chalk and I was greatly disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed as I was afraid I would receive</seg><seg type="columnLine">no message.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER looking them over carefully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wiping them a few times with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my handkerchief to make sure they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely clean, I then laid them on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor and placed my foot on them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime the medium had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a trance, or coma. Presently va-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rious persons began to feel as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">something was writing inside of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">slates, and very soon several of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">held up their slates, completely filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with writing. One slate was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morse Code, written to a telegraph</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent, while several were written in for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eign languages--especially one, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally had to be read by a Chinaman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All at once I heard something scratch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing inside of Dr. Ralston's slates and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently he opened them to find this</seg><seg type="columnLine">message:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You won't accomplish your de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sire tonight, and in the other world</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you will also be thwarted, as justice</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cannot be cheated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">(Signed) Your cousin,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">              Joe Wakefield."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The doctor seemed very much dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased and disturbed by this message.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost instantly I began to feel some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing vibrating and scratching between</seg><seg type="columnLine">my slates. After the scratching had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased, I opened my slates and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">this weird and uncanny message:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You will be face to face with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Death this evening, and you will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">escape him, only to meet him „ter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Who knows what the outcome will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be? I see a hangman's noose coil</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and drop around your neck.

I trembled as though stricken</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a siege of ague. But I hid my dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort as best I could, and kept Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ralston from looking at my message.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After almost everyone had received a</seg><seg type="columnLine">message, either by slate or independent</seg><seg type="columnLine">answers to their questions, the medium</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he was in the right condition to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few demonstrations of materializing--</seg><seg type="columnLine">which amounts to having the dead re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn with seemingly their earthly bodies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and converse with the living. The me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dium then selected three men, of whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">I happened to be one, to come up behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">a screen placed for the occasion, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strip him from head to foot to see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had no paraphernalia from which lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">might produce, or imitate, fraudulent</seg><seg type="columnLine">spooks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After we were all satisfied that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to produce spooks with, we gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him some silk pajamas to put on, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">we placed him in the cabinet. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">three sided affair, built for the purpose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembling a screen. After he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated inside this, we placed his feet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in a pan of meal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We also had a man, one of the three of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, sit in the cabinet and hold his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">all during the seance. This second</seg><seg type="columnLine">seance was conducted in semi-darkness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet it was quite light enough to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguish different objects in the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE medium went into a trance, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a short wait, a white-like sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance that reminded me of a spider</seg><seg type="columnLine">web, began to flow from his mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soon faces began to take form out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this substance. Sometimes an arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">would appear, or a foot. Finally, to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment, a voice in the cabinet</seg><seg type="columnLine">which came from the medium's mouth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but which I would have known any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where as my father's, called out: "Doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor Grey, come up to the cabinet. Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">father is here I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I walked up close, my nerves tingling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could hardly believe my eyes.

Yet his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face wore a worried expression, as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been having a great deal of trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Charley, my boy," he said in quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones, "you are in terrible danger, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">see much evil around you.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor was greatly upset and now my</seg><seg type="columnLine">l&gt;elief, which I had held from the first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was a magician, grew stronger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I fully believe that this was the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time Dr. Ralston had been brought face</seg><seg type="columnLine">to face with the genuine goods. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">better state, for those of you that may</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie skeptical, that twelve forms in all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared at this materialization. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">were children, of whom several were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not recognized, although most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits were. Many people went away</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm believers, while the skeptics went</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, as they came, saying it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of the devil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the meeting the doctor and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">both secured our slates by each paying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sum of one dollar. I would gladly</seg><seg type="columnLine">have given a thousand dollars, or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, for the experience of seeing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversing with my father.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the way home the doctor started</seg><seg type="columnLine">in making insinuating remarks about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Turner and myself. This kept up</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I could endure hi£ vile tongue no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer. My blood boiled. I told him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppressed tones, about seeing him make</seg><seg type="columnLine">love to my wife. I was driving the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the time and as we were approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bridge at the bottom of a steep hill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with almost cat-like agility, he grabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steering wheel out of my hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed the car for the side of the bridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To late I saw this fiend's plan for</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting me to come to the meeting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Now I realized why he didn't ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wife to come along, for he intended</seg><seg type="columnLine">murdering me and having it appear as</seg><seg type="columnLine">accidental. Before I could check him</seg><seg type="columnLine">he headed the car straight through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the bridge. There was a deep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock-strewn ravine below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUST before the car hit the bridge, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor gave me a mocking laugh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped, intending to land on the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of the bridge. But lie must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost his footing, or the car gaining speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">altered his calculations, for he gave forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most fiendish cry of mortal terror I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have ever heard. It reminded me of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rat that is cornered and knows that it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to die. I jumped just as the crash</seg><seg type="columnLine">came and managed to land on my hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knees on the bank ahead of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge. The car went crashing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, to be smashed into complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreckage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside of a few cuts and bruises, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was none the worse for the affair, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though my nerves were playing havoc</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me. I picked my way very cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiously until at last I reached the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ravine. Here I found what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">left of the car--and Dr. Ralston. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not dead when I arrived, but kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">moaning. I brought some water from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stream and drenched him, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to brighten him up. At last lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his eyes to stare at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as he recognized me, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">started cursing me, and saying: "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">win now, but damn you, I'll win her yet!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And 1 will come back and haunt you</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hate then, as I am hating you now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that outburst of passion the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood started flowing faster. A tremor</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocked his whole body. His eyes began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to glaze and roll upward. With his last</seg><seg type="columnLine">death rattle he wheezed out: "Damn</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Grey!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The car was a total wreck. But among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wreckage I found my slate. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unscathed, save for a few blurs. Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ralston's slate was demolished almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond recognition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I walked about a mile down the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I came to a ranch. I told them</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we had had an accident and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my companion, Dr. Ralston, was killed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had them summon an ambulance from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the undertakers in Los Angeles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and also a taxi to pick me up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">My wife was greatly shocked when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she learned the news of the doctor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">death and how nearly I had come to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing killed. She seemed greatly worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">about my slate when she read about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hangman's noose. She said she had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">having some messages coming to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her guides, that seemed to speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">of foreboding evil, but they always came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sj-mbols she couldn't understand. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to laugh it off, to keep her from</seg><seg type="columnLine">worrying. But I can't say I wasn't glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Dr. Ralston was put away for</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeps, into the cold, cold ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shortly before the doctor's death he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had started rumors around the town to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effect that Miss Turner and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been carrying on an illicit love affair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The scandal was started, and my pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tients began leaving me in such numbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I became frantic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ABOUT this time a wisdom tooth be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came ulcerated and I was obliged to</seg><seg type="columnLine">call in a dentist. After the dentist exam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ined me he found another tooth that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">diseased and advised me to take gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he extracted them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not want this, but I finally con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented to take the anesthetic, and soon f</seg><seg type="columnLine">was under its influence. It seemed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I was floating in space and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul was freed from its encasement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh. I felt so restful and calm, better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I had felt for months, for the pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing events had proven a terrible strain</seg><seg type="columnLine">on me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I seemed to be able to look down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dentist who was working on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. At times it seemed as though I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw forms and faces flit by me, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to catch fragments of thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations, part of which I couldn't un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand. Then almost at once, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked back into my body and I coidd</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly hear the dentist saying to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistant: "He is coming out of it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">O.	K." Then he began pumping oxygen</seg><seg type="columnLine">into me. I felt almost angry at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dentist for bringing me back to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">world of worry and strife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few days later, I seemed to hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Ralston's voice calling to me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying: "Why don't you administer</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself some gas and rest in peace and</seg><seg type="columnLine">contentment?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried to shake this feeling off, but at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last I couldn't stand it any longer, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after telling my assistant that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">through for the day and that she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">go, I locked the door and made ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take another peaceful soul flight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">explore the mysteries of the unknown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I was soon experiencing the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecstasies I had experienced on the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vious occasion. Here was contentment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace and rest, and for a while I just</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated in the ether. I soon learned, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a kind of mental vibration, that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces I had encountered were the souls</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of men who once had lived on earth, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">through some laws that they had broken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were doomed to be earth-bound. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them were doomed to float about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth plane for centuries before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be able to work out their salva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. I expected to see Dr. Ralston</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them. For, did he not have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart and soul of a murderer? But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't see anything of him. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though I had been in this world of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits a long time, when in reality it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was but a few moments. I was grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually pulled back into my earthly body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and soon I gained consciousness again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I kept this secret practice up for sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral months until it was beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell on me. Even my old friends who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stuck to me while the scandal was</seg><seg type="columnLine">raging full blast, began winking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapping their heads as though they</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought I was losing my mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last came the day that I'll never</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget--the day that brings this narra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive to a climax. The wife for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">days had been complaining of several</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth that were almost driving her fran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic. She had insisted that I pull them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but already, "My Lady of the Gas" had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened her tentacles on me, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't want to be cheated out of the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joyment I derived from my new-found</seg><seg type="columnLine">revelation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sent my asssistant away as usual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had become of late almost a daily</seg><seg type="columnLine">custom, and soon I had the mask over</seg><seg type="columnLine">my face and was thrilling from head to</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot with expectancy. At last 1 was</seg><seg type="columnLine">freed of my earthly carcass, but in giv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the gas I must have been in too big</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hurry. Heretofore an elastic-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">silken cord held my soul to the body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh. Now I felt it snap, and I shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">up into a void which I can't describe</seg><seg type="columnLine">as space, as I seemed to be beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">control of gravity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS I shot upward I looked back. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw my earthly body topple from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dentist chair and slump down in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heap. Almost at once I heard a fiendish</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh. I knew it to be Dr. Ralston's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and too late I realized his horrible pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a second, it seemed to me, I saw my</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly body squirming around on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, stretching first one arm out, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, and gradually get to its feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I saw my own face, distorted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">passion and lust, grinning at me in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion that would put the devil him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to shame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I next saw my wife enter the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first this puzzled me, but I remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered I hadn't locked the door as usual.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Ralston, in my body, walked up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wife and smiled, in my usual way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He patted her on the back sympathet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ically. What was going to happen next?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He placed her in the chair and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to extract her teeth. He adjusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mask over her face and began pump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I was frozen with horror. Wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fiend ever stop pumping? Then it</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawned on me that he was murdering</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. I couldn't utter a word of warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if I could have, I knew it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never be understood because only thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">telepathy is effective on the astral plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My brain was paralyzed from the sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror of the situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last my wife's body slumped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">GHOST STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the chair and began getting rigid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I saw her coming toward me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arms outstretched, and just as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to hold her to me, I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fiendish laughter I knew so well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The next thing I knew Dr. Ralston had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed my wife out from my grasp, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two of them floated upward clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the ceiling of the office, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to where I knew not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I spent what was to me years of agony</seg><seg type="columnLine">in search of my wife, but never a trace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her. At last, worn out and heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken, I found myself back beside my</seg><seg type="columnLine">old body and by sheer will power, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">pried my way back into it. I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of my earthly body only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, yet it was long enough for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor, allied with his band of black</seg><seg type="columnLine">artisans, to accomplish his fiendish deed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I came to earthly consciousness slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, hoping against hope that this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the fantasy of a tired, deranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain, but alas, I found my wife stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on the floor just as I had looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon her while in the astral plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gathered her in my arms tenderly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to bring her to life, but to no avail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally I went for help, and what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">my surprise and anger when two officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the law placed me under arrest for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the murder of my wife. The irony of it!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The treasure I valued above all else.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And to think the world brands me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">her murderer!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No wonder I pace back and forth in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my cell like some untamed animal. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the fear to die, but the irony of</seg><seg type="columnLine">justice, as man knows it. For months</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was silent only to the extent that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">plead "not guilty," which as God Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty is my judge, is the truth. I find</seg><seg type="columnLine">little consolation in the Bible, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have read it through three times. If</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it were not for the knowledge of another</seg><seg type="columnLine">world and of spiritual truths and phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomena, that I have proven, I wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be consoled.

The long deceased Andrew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brainard might possibly have written it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in either French or English; that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">what made it doubly difficult of solution.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No doubt it was a simple code: letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">for letter. The first page occupied his</seg><seg type="columnLine">labors for two hours, during which time</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam made the rounds of the house four</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, yet he was no nearer a solution</seg><seg type="columnLine">than when he started. All of the letters</seg><seg type="columnLine">were run together, and comparative elim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ination was difficult.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam made another round of the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at eleven-fifteen Travers told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could retire, much to the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">negro's relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He went through the house slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying every door ar.d window, stopping</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his room to put on a pair of felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">slippers, and to obtain his revolver and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flashlight. The upstairs rooms in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new section were given a careful scru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny, Travers making sure that the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows were all locked. He then switched</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the lights, and closed the hall door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and locked it, putting the key in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket. The rest of the upper part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house, containing his own room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evelyn's, and the Grovers', seemed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaceful order. He heard the deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing of the doctor coming through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the partly opened door of his room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Grover and Evelyn were no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">peacefully sleeping behind the locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of Evelyn's room. He left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall light burning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Downstairs, Travers closed the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows and locked the doors of the rooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">not in use, and retired to the library to</seg><seg type="columnLine">study the old diary with its baffling</seg><seg type="columnLine">cipher. The way the letters were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">run together in unbroken lines across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the page tried his patience, until sudden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly he found a single instance where a</seg><seg type="columnLine">line was broken, at the bottom of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">page.

He nodded abstractedly, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no comment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was two days later, and before Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinus had had time to go further into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case, that we had a visit from Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Temple again. She appeared in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest distress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know what I'm going to do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Martinus," she sobbed, "--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear Mr. Craven admits that he is at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wits' end. He was so sure that dear</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Doris would be satisfied when</seg><seg type="columnLine">things were put back as they were, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's growing worse all the time, and it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only in that room now--it's all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house. My maid has left me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAT particular manifestations have</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred?" asked Martinus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Footsteps up and down the stairs at</seg><seg type="columnLine">night--a man's heavy footsteps. Doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening and slamming. Pictures falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the wall. And last night, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay in bed, I could have sworn I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers about my throat. My maid was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinchcd black and blue, too. Oh, Doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor, it can't be Doris 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, it's not your little girl," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martinus. "Have you been dreaming?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Dreadful dreams, but I can't remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber anything about them, except that-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">she hesitated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That?" queried the doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That I had murdered somebody and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to be executed. But I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know who it was, or how I was to die.''</seg><seg type="columnLine">She broke into hysterical weeping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Martinus made her $it down and mixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">some bromide for her. After a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">while she grew calmer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am sorry to be so hysterical," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">apologized, "but I've gone through so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much. What with my little girl and my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">husband-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Tell me about your husband," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor gently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, it was just at the time Doris</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay dying. He was in Texas, and hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard anything about her illness, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause he was off with a posse. He sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">me some clippings, and that alone would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have scared me nearly to death."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A posse, you say?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, Doctor. You remember read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about that man who escaped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the penitentiary, and shot his way clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">across three States--James O'Connor?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The doctor shook his head. But I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered the affair. O'Connor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been serving a life term for murder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had broken loose, after killing three</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards, and had escapcd. At least a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen of his pursuers had been killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wounded before the posse surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in his stronghold. There had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">summary vengeance taken. The bandit's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was left swinging from a tree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">riddled with bullets. I recalled the cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumstances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"My husband was with that posse,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Mrs. Temple. "And he had written</seg><seg type="columnLine">me about being summoned by the sheriff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that -- with Doris dying -- nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed me! I was afraid I should lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">both of them. Jim and I have always</seg><seg type="columnLine">been devoted to each other, and his ab-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sence is unbearable now. He's coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">home for good soon, and I'm trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold out till then. But after what's</seg><seg type="columnLine">been happening-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Martinus patted her arm sympath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">etically. "I think we shall be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remedy things, Mrs. Temple," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Suppose we come up to your house</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-night. Can Mr. Craven provide a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liable medium for a seance?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes, there's Mrs. Jimpson. She's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful," said Mrs. Temple. "Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she described my father perfectly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave me his name and everything."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get her to your house to-night, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine, then," said Martinus. He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me when she had gone. "We can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">use any of my mediums on a case like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this," he said. "I imagine this Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimpson is one of Craven's crowd, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">just the kind likely to attract the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est of the late James O'Connor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You mean--you think it's O'Connor</seg><seg type="columnLine">manifesting in the house?" I exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a perfectly good working theory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and decidedly a probability," he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," he explained, as we started</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Mrs. Temple's house, "if Jim Tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple took a prominent part in the lynch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of this bandit, it is probable that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fellow passed out with feelings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">intense malignancy against him and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest. When a murderer is hurried into</seg><seg type="columnLine">eternity, as you know, he can hardly be</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to be dead, in the sense that ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary people die. Cut off in the full</seg><seg type="columnLine">■vigor of bodily prowess and activity, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is simply a disembodied entity, just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much attached to the earth life, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petually rehearsing his crime and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances of his death, and utilizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">every opportunity to use other physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediums for the gratification of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly desires and for revenge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why should he have succeeded id</seg><seg type="columnLine">molesting Mrs. Temple?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"rT'HE fact that Jim Temple's little girl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I passed out almost at the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">as himself established a rapport. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are rapports of hate as well as of love.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have no doubt that, in an obscure way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">James O'Connor discovered this means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of at once getting into touch with earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">life and of obtaining revenge. The emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional condition under which Mrs. Tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple was laboring, the fact that her hus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">band had her constantly in his mind--</seg><seg type="columnLine">you heard her say they were devoted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other--established the links in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But he found the house occupied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The little spirit of Doris guarded it, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as love is stronger than hate, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerless--'till that fool Craven took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the toys away, turned the furniture</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, and played havoc generally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then, when Craven re-established the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrine--well, he had re-established a</seg><seg type="columnLine">road that was easy following for James</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Connor. But if that Mrs. Jimpson is</seg><seg type="columnLine">any good at all we ought to learn some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. One word--" he cautioned me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It would be as well not to allude to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicions as to the identity of the polter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geist. If they think it is the child Doris,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our friend O'Connor will play up to them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and incidentally play into our hands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Jimpson was awaiting our ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rival with Craven when we reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. The interior was brilliantly lit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with electric bulbs of great power. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was easy to see that Mrs. Temple was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of the dark. The child's room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which the seance was to be held, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been arranged under Craven's instruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. It contained the usual curtain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark cloth strung across a comer, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">form a cabinet, and the half circle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs extending from this to the further</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the table that held the toys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Jimpson was a common sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, but manifestly mediumistic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is something about a genuine me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dium's eyes that identify her. She went</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the cabinet, and passed into trance</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the facility of long experience. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined that the late James O'Connor</seg><seg type="columnLine">would manifest through her, much more</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily than the child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before Mrs. Jimpson had settled her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, Martinus took the doll from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand and examined it. It was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those large "Mamma" dolls, with mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able arms and legs, about the size of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">three months' child. The doctor handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to Mrs. Temple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Please hold this on your lap and</seg><seg type="columnLine">under no circumstances loose your hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it during the seance," he told her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T^OCTOR, do you think this will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">U bring my darling Doris back like</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was before?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think it vital that you should asso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciate yourself with this doll," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martinus, in his curt manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What Doctor Martinus means," put</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Craven blandly--I could see he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not relish taking a secondary part in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proceedings--"is that the influence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mother-love will pass into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doll, creating a fetish."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's one way of putting it," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor ironically. "Any way, please</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember my instructions, Mrs. Temple.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, of course, you understand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circle is under no circumstances to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be broken. Are you ready, Mrs. Jimp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son?" He snapped off the electric light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard the medium breathing stertor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously within the cabinet. She stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">restlessly. Sighs came from her lips. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the tenseness emanating from Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Temple next to me. In the faint light</seg><seg type="columnLine">that came through the window I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outlines of the large doll she held in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arms. Was it only imagination, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the thing actually resemble more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more a living child? The stiff body</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be growing limp, the head to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall back into the fold of the woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly a whimper broke from Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Temple's lips:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It--it's moving I It--oh, Doctor Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinus I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold it I" I heard the doctor whisper</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I felt it move.

I thought the curtains before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabinet seemed to bulge outward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I confess my nerves almost gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">way as I heard the sudden tiny, piping</seg><seg type="columnLine">G II 0 S T S TORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Sensational</seg><seg type="columnLine">Typewriter Offer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">voice from within the cabinet clearly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Mamina!" it cried--just like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mamma" doll, but it did not come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doll--"Mamma!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had thought Mrs. Temple a hyster-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical person, but she kept herself in ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirable control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is that you, Doris, my darling?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered, with a quick intake of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Mamma, where are you?" the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">piped. "I can't find you. I've been look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for you. I'm all alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here is your mother, Doris," came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor's voice.

What was occur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring in the darkness? How still it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">was! Even ^the medium had ceased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">moan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you like your baby sister,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doris?" said Martinus softly. I knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by some sixth instinct, that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripping Mrs. Temple's arm to keep her</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet. "Come, don't be afraid, my child.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come and see Mother and her little new</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again that dreadful silence. My hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt almost as if standing on end. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was moving near me in 'the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, Suddenly a scream of uncontrol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lable terror burst from Mrs. Temple's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's all!" shouted Martinus. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment the room was flooded with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric light. Mrs. Temple was lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in her chair in a dead faint, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">still gripping the child's doll. And it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just a doll, nothing more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dear little Doris always wanted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby sister," said Mrs. Temple later.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But why was it necessary to deceive</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, Doctor? It seems so dreadful that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she should not have recognized the doll</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was so fond of."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had taken quite a little while to</seg><seg type="columnLine">recover from the shock.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">faker had taken it with a bad grace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there had been something like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage at arms between the two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he withdrew with Mrs. Jimpson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear Mrs. Temple, if the decep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion comforted you, surely it was justi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied," said the doctor glibly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why did she not recognize the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doll?-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because she had been lost so long.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">You must remember time does not pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">oil the other side as it does with us.

The medium</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to struggle and moan. And thi3</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I was conscious of a presence, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">describably evil, in that room. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like physical contact with something too</seg><seg type="columnLine">loathsome to have human form. I shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered, I felt nauseated; it was all I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do to keep my place in the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle. I wondered if the others felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same. All the while, too, it seemed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I was resisting some physical pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, bent on crowding me out. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained against the chair--heard myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing hurriedly--felt the surge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood through my body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It came: "Mammal Mammal" piping</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the cabinet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doris?

I saw him outlined</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely against the faint light of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window-square.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Daddy! I want my Daddy 1" came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the baby yoice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Daddy is here," boomed Craven.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Now what induced the man to utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lie is more than either Martinus or</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could figure afterward. There fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed a tense silence. Then that evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">power within the room seemed to dom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inate, to overwhelm me. My brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeled. I was choking for breath,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A peal of maniacal laughter rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the silence. And I knew there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a body there--some vast, inchoate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil thing that seemed to fill the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A chair fell over. The thing laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and mingled with it came Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Temple's scream, and a sound from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Craven's throat that I cannot possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">describe. It was a cry, but a cry that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed the embodiment of utter despair</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the cry of dissolution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then--a heavy body toppling to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, and threshing it with its heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The light, the light, Branscombe, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">God's sake!" I heard Martinus calling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as if from far away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were both groping for the button.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We struck our heads together in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark, fumbled in the dark, and at last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow, got the light turned on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The medium was stirring in the cab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inet. Mrs. Temple was seated rigid in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her chair, staring in front of her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttering. The light of reason was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone from her eyes. On the floor lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">Craven, apparently hugging to his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ghost Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">79</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the '•Mamma'' doll, with frantic grip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as we bent over him I saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little porcelain fingers were fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his throat like steel hooks, so deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the swelling flesh was already clos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over the arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Craven was dead. The fingers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doll had stopped the circulation in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carotids completely. Death had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of perhaps fifteen seconds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE rest is happier than either of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">had hoped. Thanks to Martinus's</seg><seg type="columnLine">care, and certain suggestions made when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Temple was in a condition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypnosis, and before she had recovered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her reason, she awakened with no recol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lection of that final scene in the drama.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had she remembered, Martinus told me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason would never have returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She was told that Craven had col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapsed and died of heart disease at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning of the seance, and this was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved by Mrs. Jimpson, who was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">in trance at the time of Craven's death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a comparatively simple matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Martinus to issue a death certificate</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this effect, and so hush up the facts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim Temple returned to a house, swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">and garnished, but this time without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil in possession. The impulse that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had enabled the dead bandit to wreak</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his revenge upon the living had been ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted by that act, and James O'Connor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was carried far beyond the sphere oi</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly passions. The Doctor burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doll in his fireplace when we got</seg><seg type="columnLine">home that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the child--Doris?''

A long pause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The man who called himself Stephen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blood, had resumed his mien of quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and calm. Ilis face was imperturbable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though a mask that he held before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, having slipped for a brief instant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now once more in place. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence his icy voice dripped it&amp; way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through to the two men who faced him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know that is so," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. "And if it is so, I can hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what affair it is of yours." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to leave the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now," he continued, "if you don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, I think I'll go back to bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll do nothing of the sort," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry.

It was a large room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering practically the length and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">width of the entire top floor of the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">private house, and it was almost bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">of furniture. Terry, torn between anx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iety for Lenore and desire to find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mystery of old Martin Grimm, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amined it swiftly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaning against the old walls were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few canvases in various stages of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletion, and a glance at these showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had not been worked on for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long time--years, perhaps. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the floor was a great easel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in one corner was a board dais,</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with royal red velvet--a stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">such' as is used by painters in portrait</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, for their sitters. Two or three</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures hung on the walls, and in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner was a rude bookcase, painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarlet and filled with books of another</seg><seg type="columnLine">generation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the work of an instant for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry and Marius to up-end the portrait</seg><seg type="columnLine">dais. It was nothing but a wooden box.</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they could see, and was absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty. There was nothing underneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and Marius replaced it with a sigh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the first thing that had occupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eye when he had glanced about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the scrubbed wooded floor the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood spot, rapidly drying, glowed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark red, and it was becoming momen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarily darker as it dried into the wood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE light in this room came from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large window overlooking the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from a skylight, the north light, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded by all painters. They could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the skylight had not been opened in</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. The iron joints were red with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rust, and the rope that guided the pane</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung down rotted and unused. Marius</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled at it, and it broke in his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The room was high, and it would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been an easy matter for any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach the skylight, much less to enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">or leave by it, though Terry and Marius</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered this possibility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think it's possible?" inquired</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marius shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I don't," he replied, "And there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no time for such an acrobatic feat</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway. You couldn't possibly reach it</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a ladder, and the ladder would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to be so long and so heavy that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be quite a stunt to draw it up</seg><seg type="columnLine">after you. I don't think that's the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was done."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'Yet They--or It--were in this room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am certain of that. And there's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood," mused Terry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, if they were, then it's a triumph</seg><seg type="columnLine">80</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ghost stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the spirit over matter, because I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see how they could have got out--es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecially if one of them wasn't willing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go. And judging from that scream, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't think that Miss Lenore was any</seg><seg type="columnLine">too anxious."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were several old trunks in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, littered with ancient paraphernalia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and these trunks they examined care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, dumping their contents out on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, in the hope that thereby they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might obtain some sort of clue to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shady undertakings that they believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin Grimm had been engaged on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was nothing upon which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could build even the flimsiest sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory. Four or five suits of old clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were there, clothes of the style that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't been worn by men for thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, boxes of dried up paints, several</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient blankets, a rusty hammer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw, a box containing nails and screws</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clips, and a book of newspaper</seg><seg type="columnLine">clippings. These clippings were from</seg><seg type="columnLine">western newspapers, they ascertained</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly, and contained notices of artistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibitions in which Martin Grimm's</seg><seg type="columnLine">paintings had been featured. They also</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the uniform of a Civil War drum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer boy, evidently the one worn by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin Grimm. It was full of moth</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes, and had a suspicious stain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">red on it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of evidence that could be of any as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistance to them, there was absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing, and after another cursory glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the great bare room, Terry turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the butler, Blood, who had been stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing impassively by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your late master was both deaf and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumb, was he not?" he asked Blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir," replied Blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the footsteps, here in this house</seg><seg type="columnLine">--he used to hear them, didn't he, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was alive--according to what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I never heard them. And, I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think he did, either," replied the butler</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. "I think it was an hallucination</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'Then how do you account for his be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the telephone as if talking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening, when he died?" persisted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquisitor, looking at him with signifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't account for it, sir," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But you must have formed some</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory about the matter. Surely it must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seemed strange to you, to have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man whom you always thought to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">deaf and dumb--if you did really think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that--talking and hearing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It was not within my province to</seg><seg type="columnLine">form theories. I did not question the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doings of Mr. Grimm. I was the butler</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. I am not a private detective."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blood spoke without rancor, and with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the impertinence that the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">would seem to indicate. It was a simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement of a fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Just what did Martin Grimm do for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a living?" asked Terry, though he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the answer to that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing. You know that, sir. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived on his income," came back the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Always--since you have known him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Always--since I have known him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And how long has that been?" per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted Terry, feeling the futility of try-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to get any information of value from</seg><seg type="columnLine">this man, who probably had so much to</seg><seg type="columnLine">disclose, that he was careful to disclose</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twenty years, sir," replied Blood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You came with him from the Coast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't you?" inquired his inquisitor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Has he always been deaf and dumb</seg><seg type="columnLine">--to your knowledge?

"Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest idea," lie said again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know that Mr. Grimm spent quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little time up here in this room," went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Terry. "Just what was it that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was doing here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more the butler shook his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Painting, I always supposed. You see,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie explained, "nobody else was ever al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed up here. I, myself, came in here</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this room very, very seldom."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He was painting, you say?" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry. "There doesn't seem to be much</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence of it. He left no amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">work at all, so far as I can see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The butler nodded. "I imagine Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grimm was a very slow worker."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was a silence, then Terry</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke. He looked Blood in the eye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his tone was low, but his words cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">through like knife blades.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know that your late master was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volved in some illegal operations," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I know, too, that you also were</seg><seg type="columnLine">involved in it--that you had knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these operations. Never mind how I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know," he hastened to add, as it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Blood was about to protest his</seg><seg type="columnLine">.innocence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," he went on, "-I know more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than you thought possible.

Now, I am going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give you a chance to tell me what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. And if I find your information of</seg><seg type="columnLine">value, I will not call in the police." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused to give this statement its proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">significance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if you don't. . . ?" Blood inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed calmly, giving Terry look for look,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dark eyes like those of a serpent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if I don't," ended Terry, "I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">call in the police, tell them what I know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and let justice take its course. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are aware of the fact that everything is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not as it should be in this house. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take very little for them to renew</seg><seg type="columnLine">their interest in the strange case of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">death of Martin Grimm. Understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">me; I am not interested in the police,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he put in a little more kindly. "What I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am interested in at this time is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereabouts of Miss Lenore.

And, I intend to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing stand in the way of my finding</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">out. I regard it as a plain duty "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a space there was a silcnce be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blood strolled quietly over to the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blood on the floor in front of the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inspected it critically. No one spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he did this. Finally he looked up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I were to tell you what I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">about this case," asked Blood, "--con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceding, which I don't, sir, that I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything further about it than you al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready know--then what?" He paused,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked enquiringly at Terry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you will tell me all that you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">about this case, and I am convinced that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are telling the truth, I will say</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to the police.

Blood looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry directly in the eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Are you trying to say that you refuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell me anything more?" said Terry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, sir--begging your pardon, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His tone was respectful, but there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inscrutably mocking gleam in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Terry knew that there was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be told. He thought of Lenore, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tortured scream which had been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last news he had heard of the woman he</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved, and anger overcame him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would shake the information out of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN a fury, he took a step forward to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man. The last he saw of him was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cold laughter in his mocking eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Blood's hand came up with the swift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and quietness of a snake, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant he had switched the light out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was the hurried banging of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, as both Marius and Terry plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the disappearing butler, missing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">exit by perhaps a fraction of an inch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damn!" ejaculated Terry, angered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he should have been duped in such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a simple, childish way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Something winged its way past</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry's head and thudded in the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">above them.

They started,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking around them for the source or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction, but could not make it out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was distant, yet somehow seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">close. It was far, yet it was all around</seg><seg type="columnLine">them ... at their elbow . . . behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">their back . . . fiendish, hard.

A wave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of the unknown swept over them--</seg><seg type="columnLine">an emotion they denied and refused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give way to, yet it was there.

It was a collection of delicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine parts, run by electricity, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced a replica of human speech. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">82</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GHOST STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was not like the phonograph, which dup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">licates speech that had been sounded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some human throat. It was different, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it spoke words that had never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttered. It was partly explained, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not entirely, as it was not yet perfected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you remember the article?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marius shook his head. "No, I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">read it, but what has that got to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing, except that it might give</seg><seg type="columnLine">ns the physical explanation which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are looking for.

"In that case, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is somebody actuating the machin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery. Is that what you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't mean anything in particular,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">confessed Terry. "I am merely casting</seg><seg type="columnLine">about for some sort of logical explana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of a perfectly illogical manifesta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. In any event, we are not alone in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house. Somebody is doing that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I knew we weren't alone, anyway,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">*aid Marius. "There is Martin Grimm</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and his paid mourner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I mean, in addition to them," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry. ''If we can locate the place that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh comes from-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems to come from every place--</seg><seg type="columnLine">from almost any place.

"Let's go on with the search."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY searched systematically, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">could find nothing. It was now broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">daylight. When they had finished with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blood's room, and had had to admit</seg><seg type="columnLine">'o each other that they had happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">on not the slightest clue, they decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work their way down through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This they did, without result, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they found themselves in the lower hall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just inside of the main entrance to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well," said Terry, "it doesn't look as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though we have had much luck, does it?".</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, it doesn't," replied Marius.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"What now? What is our next step?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Of course, we still have the base-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and the cellar to go through-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But before that, I think we ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">search one more room," said Marius</seg><seg type="columnLine">significantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You mean-" began Terry, motion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with his head to the door behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">which rested the body of Martin Grimm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the professional watcher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, I do," said Marius. "I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's very important -- more important</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any other room in the house. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know it hardly seems ethical to disturb</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the sleep of the dead, but-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The dead are not disturbed," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry. "It is only the living who can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be disturbed. The dead are beyond our</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach." He paused for a moment. "But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we don't seem to he beyond theirs, if-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY listened at the door for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, but could hear nothing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird chant of the paid watcher had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been heard for a long time now. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently died away with the coming of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day, or a little before. They pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured him, alone there through the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">night with his dead, plying his grisly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forbidding trade. Terry permitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself a slight shiver, which passed un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed, Marius either not seeing, or, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any rate, pretending not to see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Terry put his hand on the knob of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door and turned, pushing the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">inwards. It opened at once, and he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marius slipped silently into the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">closing the door behind them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was dark, except for the flickering</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the candles which burned low at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of the bier in the ccnter of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. The shades were drawn so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">no light could enter, and in the shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unsteady candle light played queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricks on the wall. They saw there the</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of a solitary watcher. He was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little old man, and he sat hunched in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair at the side of the coffin--fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had four days' growth of grizzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiskers, and a curiously shapen head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was partly accounted for by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that he had but one ear, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">being not even a stump, but having</seg><seg type="columnLine">been sliced off close to his head. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave his head a strange appearance, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it was out of drawing--and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">made Terry feel as though it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn by an artist who would presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">rub it out and try drawing it all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He sat hunched in his chair, head</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen forward on his chest, one arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">sticking grotesquely out over the arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the chair. He was snoring slightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The atmosphere in the room was pe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culiar--as it always was, even when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin Grimm was alive. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pungent odor there--almost the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">odor that they had smelled on the mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage from The Seven. In the weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows they could make out that old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grimm's coffin was covered by a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">silk cloth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">For a few moments they stood just</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside the doorway, without saying a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word. Finally Terry spoke:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor old Grimm 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"He is buried tomorrow?" inquired</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marius softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Terry nodded.

In reality, my object was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sec for myself what sort of woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was, and learn if possible what</seg><seg type="columnLine">could cause Jennings' continued mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">upset. If the cause could be remedied</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a human way, I would see it. If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the condition to be one of evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit influence--I at least would know</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and be able to advise him how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Naturally, I would make no refer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence to Jennings' call of the night be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, and I would give no indication that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had told me any of his affairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A maid showed me into a well-fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nished reception room on the lower floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was my first step inside his house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was agreeably surprised to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place well furnished in a conven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional way, with easy chairs, brass</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buddhas and other charms on the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tel, oil landscapes and girl's heads in</seg><seg type="columnLine">attractive frames adorning the walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good afternoon, Mrs. Jennings," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">said as she entered. She was a tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender woman, of rather nervous make-</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. I noted with a swift glance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she wore a lacy negligee, and was carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a lighted cigarette. "I trust you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will pardon this intrusion, but I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that such elose neighbors as we are,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">should know each other better."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She knitted her brows, and for a mo'</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment stood staring at me. She gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">me no handshake of welcome, didn't in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vite me to sit down. It seemed as if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">were trying to probe what I had said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find some ulterior motive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think I know you pretty well now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Kirkland," she replied, taking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep inhalation from her cigarette. "Ed</seg><seg type="columnLine">has told me he met you often on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train going in. You're something of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spiritualist, aren't you?" A faint smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">puckered the corners of her mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'll have to excuse my saying so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but you came at a most inopportune</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No further hint was necessary. "My</seg><seg type="columnLine">apologies, Mrs. Jennings.

I made out a man's voice and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman's. They came, it seemed, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">my bedside not three feet away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Instantly I was wide awake. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first thought that flashed through my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind was that here was Jennings' ghost</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to spread its evil influence over</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Terrified, holding my breath lest I</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturb the specter, I waited. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The voices were human enough, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came from the head of a garage</seg><seg type="columnLine">driveway that separates Jennings' house</seg><seg type="columnLine">from mine. In my first moment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wakefulness I attached a supernatural</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning to them. And what I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">those next few seconds gave me a shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wasn't prepared for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No--no, Jim. For the hundredth</seg><seg type="columnLine">time no.''

If Ed were anything but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor sap he is,-I'd go in a minute. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that, darling. But I can't bear to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt him that way. He's too good. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">too thoughtful and kind. That's just</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trouble. I couldn't be happy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his misery on my mind always. No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim. I can't go away with you.

It was a thick voice--husky.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't be mistaken, for the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard tone of voice she had used with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, I heard coming through the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night. But who was Jim?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT didn!t matter. Much of Jennings'</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem was clear to me now. Poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil! It was the old story of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady, regular husband being too con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistently good for a cigarette-smoking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink-loving wife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But how account for the ghost? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">"temperamental upsets" the woman had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were clear now. I suppose the situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of living with an adoring husband and</seg><seg type="columnLine">loving some one else, was at times in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tolerable to her, and she blew up occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sionally, because she couldn't help her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. But the phantom that-haunted Ed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Jennings-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was some time before I fell asleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. And when I awakened, the bright</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight was flooding through my win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow. I looked at my watch, and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was nearly half-past seven--</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely time for me to catch the eight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the train I ran into Jennings. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was slumped into a window seat, staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the ceiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello!" I said, taking the seat next</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him.1 It was the first time I had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">him since he came over to my house</seg><seg type="columnLine">that first night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, hello, Kirkland."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Saying nothing else, he resumed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at the ceiling. For a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 sensed that he too had heard the talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">between his wife and her visitor the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, and was trying to make up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind what he should do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How've you been, old man? Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing all right?" I asked, taking no</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice of his preoccupied manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I've been all right. Nothing has</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. Say, Kirkland, I've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking a lot about what you told me.1'</seg><seg type="columnLine">He paused, and a strange, far-away look</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into his eyes. "All life is spirit--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can see it! I feel it! After death</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is no worry--all is happiness!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Right!" I exclaimed, secretly pleased</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lie showed signs of profiting by</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I had said to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">■p.UT before I could go on, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">U shrunk within hiiJlself once more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that far-away, strange look had died</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The train pulled out, stopped at several</seg><seg type="columnLine">way stations, then settled down for its</seg><seg type="columnLine">long run before reaching New York.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These early inqrning trains made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">stops near New York, being rated as</seg><seg type="columnLine">expresses for the twenty miles or so</seg><seg type="columnLine">just outside the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had left the last stop, and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">just gathering speed for the express run,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Jennings aroused himself, and said</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly: "No worries after death. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">go right on living--always happy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He wasn't addressing me. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking to himself. I" paid no attention.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nor did I take notice when he spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thoughts aloud twice more before</seg><seg type="columnLine">we reached the city. "No worry after</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. All life is spirit.

No further</seg><seg type="columnLine">word was spoken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went through the business I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attend to during the day, and arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">home about three in the afternoon. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">day was gone, so far as concentrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">work was concerned, so I settled down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to read. I selected a new book on</seg><seg type="columnLine">"occult theories and collected facts,'-</seg><seg type="columnLine">written by an East Indian. And before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had gone very far, I came across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"astral body" theory, stated clearly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">concisely, and giving at least a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">examples taken from life, of evidences</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the theory is something more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a theory--that it is actually a working</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When the mind thinks, the soul fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows the thoughts," I read. "Where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts are, there will the soul be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found. And at times the thought is so</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong as to cause the soul to take visi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble shape, the shape, of course, of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">physical body-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jennings! My mind focussed on him</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once. Here was the explanation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">90</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GHOST STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the phantom. His wife's thoughts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">so centered on getting him out of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, that her astral body projected it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to his bedchamber, to his front</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorstep. It was this that haunted him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And she wouldn't leave him for fear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurting him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I knew better. Actually, she was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coward. She feared to hurt herself by</seg><seg type="columnLine">running the risk of being hounded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscience. What a scrambled affair</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Jennings situation was!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although I did not then realize it, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair was to come to a swift and terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble end that very night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was the dinner hour. I was out</seg><seg type="columnLine">back cleaning the spark plugs in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">car. Suddenly my attention was drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Jennings' dining room, which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the rear of their house, behind a tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">hedge. Loud voices attracted me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I couldn't see, I could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly what went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It started with a crash of china. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voice of Mrs. Jennings:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, I hate you so 1 I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I ever married you! No friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no life in this hole--nothing! Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">meals a day, mow the lawn on Saturday,</seg><seg type="columnLine">read the paper on Sunday--and you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied. Get out of my sight before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The hysteria back of those words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made me nervous. And, there was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing malignant about them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But. my dear, I love you," I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jennings say. "If you haven't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy with me here, you should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">said so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The quiet way he said it, wrung my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">heart for the man!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Love you?

It was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much like eavesdropping. I came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own house and closed the door. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinner had been prepared by my house-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper but I had little appetite for it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After I had eaten I sat around awhile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hopes Jennings would call.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But lie never came. He went that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night to a place far removed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 LEARNED later that it was a maid</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Jennings household who gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the alarm. Just as I sat down to eat, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard hurried footsteps outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, and a loud rapping on the Jen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nings front door. Peering out, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">two uniformed policemen. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted--only to come out a few min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes later, leading Jennings. Mrs. Jen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nings lay within the house--dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had to pass my house to get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Main Street. And as they walked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">past my door, Jennings made them stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentarily while he glanced in at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting-room window near which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat that first night. From behind a cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain in the dining room I saw him smile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard his lips* form the words:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All life is spirit. No worry after</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. After death--happiness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And for a long moment he lingered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyeing the house. The gathering crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't understand, nor could the two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">officers of the law make out what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant. But to me it was a kind of bene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diction, a kind of warped gratitude he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to express to me. Then they led</seg><seg type="columnLine">him away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They charged him with first degree</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder, but his case never went to trial.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poor Jennings' reason had snapped, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they put him where warmth, shelter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">good food will be his lot while he lives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From a gossiping maid the neighbor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood learned that on that fatal night he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out about "Jim," and the terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">import snapped his reason. According</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the maid, lie had no censure, no vin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dictiveness. Only concern for his wife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in his mental distraction he used a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of strangler's hands to send her</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had come to know "there is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry--all is happiness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nobody ever found out who the mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious Jim was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And for myself--logically, I had rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son to take unto myself a share in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragedy, for wasn't it I who had started</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind to work on the channels that</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him to ruin? Never mind my</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive.

Without waiting for an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">answer he said: "This thing has hap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pened before. It began in Africa. On</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the night we went aboard at Mombasa</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I was just going to sleep when Forber</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">started up with a shout. I jumped out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of my bunk and put my hand on his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. He was fighting something,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but as soon as I touched him he laughed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and said it was all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Forber interrupted by suggesting we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">should have a drink. With quick, jerky</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">movements, he fetched a bottle of whis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">key from the mantel. Then he got three</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">glasses and a syphon of soda. I could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">see he hated to leave my side. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">poured out a stiff drink with shaky hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then he turned to me and apologized</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for his bad manners. I helped myself,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and Roberson did likewise. We all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drank raising our glasses with trembling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Though thoroughly shaken I could not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">help seeing the humor of three vigorous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">men petrified with fear and trembling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at every sound. But I was in a hurry</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to go. I rose and put down my glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I stepped toward the door and found</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Forber there before me, gun in hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No you don't," he said brutally. "You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are going to stay right here.

I'm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">done."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He pulled a chair to the door and sat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down heavily. I pulled out my cigarette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">case and offered it to each. We lit up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and I helped myself to another drink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As I passed the writing desk I caught</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sight of the telephone. On the pretext</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of helping myself to some more soda, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">leaned over the desk and lifted the re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ceiver from its hook. As I resumed my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seat I noticed that Roberson was sunk</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in sleep. Forber was blinking but still</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">alert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Roberson is tired out," said Forber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He cleared his throat.

Forber started up. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">opened the door. A sleepy youth stood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the end of the passage, and gaped at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">us. Forber's appearance, bloodstained</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and dishevelled, startled him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, what do you want?" demanded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Forber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The receiver is off," said the youth,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"and folks are complaining 'cause the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bell keeps ringing." Forber glanced at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the desk. He strode across and replaced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the receiver while I moved quickly into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the hallway pulling the door behind me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I held the handle firmly. I heard For-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ber dash across the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "For Heaven's sake, Hardman," he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gasped, "don't leave us I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I told him through the door that I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be back in a minute and stepped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into the lift.

It was a dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">oriental face with an expression of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traordinary concentration. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the house he overtook, in St. James'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street, a dark-skinned man who turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">apprehensively upon him as he passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardman did not stop but lie noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's hands were soiled and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes dusty. After he had gone twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">paces he regretted his lack of enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise. When he turned again the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone. He had spoken one word as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardman passed him. At the time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it was a mere exclamation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise at the near collision. After-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards Hardman seemed to accept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word as sounding like "Karma."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I reminded him that Karma is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word usfid by the Buddhists to indicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the law that "what a man sows, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall he also reap."

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke of a series of particularly atro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious cases of cruelty to natives, flogging</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unspeakable practices. An inquiry</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ordered. Evidence pointed to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man, but the natives were reluc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant to give testimony. Forber was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixed up in it but he appeared to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">some influence and was permitted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I don't offer this as a satisfactory ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plantation but if you believe in esoteric</seg><seg type="columnLine">influences, thought waves, mental sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestion, or hypnotic processes--it may</seg><seg type="columnLine">give you something to work on. Hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man would not go further than that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is guess-work, at best.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Specter of the Ijellou? Quarter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">became unconscious. I asked him about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whereabouts of Tom, Tsing's grand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, who formerly had lived with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He replied that he did not know--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom had not been near the house for</seg><seg type="columnLine">days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not only through the tales told me by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man, but from other sources, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that Tom did most of his gambling</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a Bowery resort operated by a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiarly known as "Black Mike."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike was of Italian extraction and very</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarthy--hence his nickname. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">met him, and we were not unfriendly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knowing that gambling was as neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary to the Chinese as food and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike was accredited with running a</seg><seg type="columnLine">"square game,'' I had not had him driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the district.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He came promptly in answer to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">summons and talked freely. In recent</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks Tom had played much at his place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luck had run against the youth, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike had permitted him to continue</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing until he owed him $5,000. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done this because, in the past, Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">had always made good. But this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">no money was forthcoming, so Mike</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally had insisted on at least a partial</seg><seg type="columnLine">payment, threatening to collect on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I.	O. U.'s from Tsing, unless the youth</seg><seg type="columnLine">made good. Even this threat, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to produced coin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then Mike had taken the slips to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suing I.um--better known in the quarter</seg><seg type="columnLine">as "Chino Joe," who long had been on</seg><seg type="columnLine">intimate terms with both Tom and his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">{Continued from page n)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grandfather--and had asked his advice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The upshot of the meeting was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suing Lum purchased the I.

He had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Tom had disappeared, but could tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of his whereabouts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T KNEW Chino Joe fairly well. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">L was the very prosperous proprietor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the quarter's best curio and jew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">elry shops and lent money on the side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found him in his shop on the extreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the quarter. He expressed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most profound sorrow over his old</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend's death and hoped that his mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derers would be apprehended and pun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Without hesitancy he told me about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the transaction involving Tom. He ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed warm friendship for the boy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisting that his worst fault was imi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tating the white gamblers. He showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me the I. O. U.'s purchased from Mike,</seg><seg type="columnLine">explaining that he had obtained them so</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would not fall into Tsing's hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had sent for Tom, advised him to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to some other city and recoup by honest</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor, promising to hold the pledges un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til such time as the youth could redeem</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He added that he did not know where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom was but believed that as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he read of his grandfather's death in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspapers, he would put in an appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance. When questioned about Bow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ming, he refused to talk, saying he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">never had seen her or discussed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Tsing, considering her presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the old man's home his private</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair. Through quarter gossip he</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood that Tom was to marry the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl. He had never heard of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">suitors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went to the restaurant of Sam Hack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one flight up over a curio shop. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known Sam for years--in fact, had helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out of a certain difficulty with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">government, which had made him my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend for life. Since taking over my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deputy's job I had renewed his acquain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance, and under pledge of secrecy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him of my connection with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There were but a few rain-soaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">stragglers in the place when I entered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only a nod of recognition passed as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to a table near a window which</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanded a view of the tenement op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite, and ordered a light meal. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time Sam was ready to serve me, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was deserted, save for us two, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could not be observed by the cooks</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the swinging doors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was still nibbling at my food and</seg><seg type="columnLine">striving to fasten upon the thing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had hinted, when a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">high pitched cries from the street below</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped me back into my surroundings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Looking out, I noted two or three</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese huddled at the curb, chattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitedly and pointing. My eyes sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place they indicated--the windows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flat of Tsing Lai Low.</seg><seg type="columnLine">GHOST STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">93</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">INSTANTLY I sprang to my feet, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulses in my head pounding, my heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumping, and pressed my face close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the pane. For, directly across from</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, in a window of the murdered man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">living quarters, stood Tsing Lai Low--</seg><seg type="columnLine">or his exact counterpart--the glare from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the electric light before the house show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing full upon him as he stood silhou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">etted against the drapes that concealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed as though his eyes met mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">full, though I could not be certain, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of the intervening distance and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbness which clutched me. But, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked, he raised his right hand, palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward me, and pressed his fingers down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chinese method ox beckoning. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next instant he was gone--disappearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">into nothingness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I jerked on my overcoat as I ran, tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the befuddled officer in the tene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment doorway and bounded up the steps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">three at a clip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What a sight met my eyes there. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">place told its own story. When I last</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen it, everything had been in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">as my assistants and I had rearranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">it Now everything was overturned from</seg><seg type="columnLine">end to end. The killers had returned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again they had searched the place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whether they had succeeded this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could only guess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">How had they entered? Surely not</seg><seg type="columnLine">as before, by one of the doors opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the hallway, for, Clancy had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">on guard there. Quickly I ran from</seg><seg type="columnLine">room to room, turning on the lights,</seg><seg type="columnLine">examining the barred windows and rat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tling the knob of each door leading to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outer passage. All were locked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet every room had been ransacked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally I reached the kitchen. The cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains of both windows were down. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked one up. The catch was properly</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and I could see the bars beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">in place. I leaped to the other and up</seg><seg type="columnLine">went the curtain. That window was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked. I flung up the sash. Three bars</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been cut away, leaving an opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than sufficient for one or several</seg><seg type="columnLine">persons to enter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">USING my flash, I examined the sill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were wet stains upon it, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtedly made by the feet of those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had entered. I swung the light wider</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the means of entry were further ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained. The circle of light fell upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging ladder of silk rope, the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of which must have been fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the chimney, or some other projec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion upon the roof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly I pieced together what must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have occurred. The intruders were will-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to take desperate chances to obtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">something which they had failed to lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate when they had killed Tsing. Know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing we could not keep track of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow men of the quarter, they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spied upon us, possibly coming and go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as residents of the house until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had learned where our guards were</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed, and that the murder rooms were</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacant. Then, knowing they could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter from the hallway, they had gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">admission from the rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, while searching, they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupted by something which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened them. Was it the cries of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese in the street, or had they too</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen the "ghost?" As that word flashed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">into my brain, I shook my head impa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiently. No, it could not have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Determined to search every possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding place in that flat before I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted again, I despatched Clancy to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hallway, instructing him to see that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not interrupted unless something of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vital importance occurred. Then I set</seg><seg type="columnLine">about my task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At various times in the past there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been occasions when it had been neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary for me to search thoroughly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters of various suspects for incrim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inating things. I was thoroughly famil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iar with the modus opcrandi and was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fident that, with unlimited time at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposal, I would be able to cover every</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch of die place so completely that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing would escape me. What the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truders had been after was a mystery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I was confident that it was neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">money nor jewels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My search lasted for many hours, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til long after gray dawn. I hunted every</seg><seg type="columnLine">nook and cranny, behind pictures and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hangings and under rugs. I examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desk and all other receptacles for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden drawers. Some such I located,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the killers had been before me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had emptied them. I went over every</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch of the closets, ripped open pillows</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mattresses, tore upholstery from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">furniture. I even looked into the kitchen</seg><seg type="columnLine">utensils and poured vegetables and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">foods from their containers. But not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single written paper of any kind did I</seg><seg type="columnLine">find.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">■JI^HILE striving to determine at what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uy point to renew my search, I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called that Poe and other famous writ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, when chronicling the thefts of fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous documents, had caused the thieves</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave their plunder in exposed places</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the surest means of keeping them</seg><seg type="columnLine">from those who tried to recover them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Such craft was associated only with un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually keen brains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Now Tsing was a logician of a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">order, and he might have tried a similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruse. My eyes began sweeping the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a bit of paper stuck carelessly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frame of a picture or in some other</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposed place. I noted nothing which</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared significant. Finally I studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the things near me. Upon a taboret at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my elbow stood an ornate, covered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">china bowl. I knew it contained sugared</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruits, for I had removed the cover "in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my search. Still-1 reached over, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versed the dish and poured its contents</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the stand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly I uttered a low cry of tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umph. For, wedged at the bottom, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a folded piece of finest parchment which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when opened, I found to be covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mass of small Chinese characters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, in one corner, was a seal stamped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Tsing family crest--probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">made by the big ring which the wise</seg><seg type="columnLine">man wore constantly.

Then I hastened to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office of the Police Commissioner, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tailed all I had done to date and showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the previous paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The translation of the document took</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a few minutes. It was even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">important in text than I had anticipated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Briefly, it disclosed that Bow Ming</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a fortune of more than a half million</seg><seg type="columnLine">American dollars coming to her, at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">marriage--at the disposition of old Tsing</seg><seg type="columnLine">--this money having been left to her in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this manner by her father, a former</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandarin, at his death. But it ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared that rich and powerful men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yellow quarter had learned of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful and wealthy girl in the seclu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of the home of Tsing Lai Low, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">these had begged permission to bid for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hand. They had been refused, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause it was Tsing's wish that Tom Low</seg><seg type="columnLine">should marry the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When Tom had disappeared, these</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealthy suitors, believing their favored</seg><seg type="columnLine">rival was definitely out of the running,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had resumed their efforts. It was then</seg><seg type="columnLine">that old Tsing had prepared a will pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viding for the girl's future under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guardianship of the leaders of the Four</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brothers, at his death. Right here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nigger in the wood-pile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MY problem then was to learn who</seg><seg type="columnLine">these suitors had been. I realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the task was well nigh impossible, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less I could locate Bow Ming, for from</seg><seg type="columnLine">no other native could I hope for assist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the third night following</seg><seg type="columnLine">my discovery of the will. I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a fever most of the day. But some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunch--compelling, though based upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">no reason--urged me to continue my</seg><seg type="columnLine">quest without let-up. And, though dusk</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought with it a furious fall of dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow, almost as impenetrable as fog, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite my aching limbs, I headed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quarter. Floundering through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifts made me desperately tired. So,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after learning from the tenement guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">that nothing had transpired, I trudged</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearily into Sam Hack's place. Noting</seg><seg type="columnLine">my condition, he gave me a hot drink,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pungent with native liquor, then per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suaded me to lie down in his tiny bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was after midnight when I awoke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The snow was still falling. Ignoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam's pleadings that I remain, I started</seg><seg type="columnLine">for home, for my head throbbed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain, my legs shook and I feared I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the verge of collapse. As I floun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered through the door to the street, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered I could see but a few feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me. A man or two passed, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark blurs identifying their presence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swinging sharply, I headed toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowery. I stumbled across the curb</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all but fell. I was in the roadway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in drifts up to my knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The dull, raucous squawk of a horn</seg><seg type="columnLine">roused me. I stepped aside just in time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape a cab. Then I plunged on</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, striving to reach the opposite side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the street. But I failed to locate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curb. I twisted and zig-zagged, but met</seg><seg type="columnLine">no obstruction. I was lost, befuddled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow blinded--unable to make my way</seg><seg type="columnLine">across a narrow New York street. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought was so fantastic that I laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then, right before me, suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the falling flakes, appeared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">counterpart of old Tsing Lai Low, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had last seen him in life, though with</seg><seg type="columnLine">features set and frowning. But I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not afraid. And in wonderment I noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no snow had settled upon his silken</seg><seg type="columnLine">robes or his flat-topped cap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come!" he said. The next instant I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt my wrist seized in a firm grip and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tsing turned and dragged me after him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a twisting route through the storm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On, on we went It seemed hours. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet lagged. I could scarcely lift them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, without warning, he brought me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a sudden halt. Strangely enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, I could see quite plainly through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the falling snow. We were before a</seg><seg type="columnLine">building. Old Tsing shook me sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pointed straight before us. "Look!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I noted two great doors--unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors, with many panels, rimmed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">red. I looked closer. The doors were</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather-beaten and old.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I realized that the grip upon my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist was gone. I glanced about me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Tsing had disappeared. I laughed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My addled brain had been playing me</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricks. Still, there were buildings before</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. By keeping close to them I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach a corner--maybe find a policeman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My eyes were closing. I staggered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a wild rushing in my ears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The snow had gone. Everything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting black-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When I regained consciousness, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found myself in bed, in a hospital, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurse bending over me. I tried to talk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But she forced me to drink and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">I dropped off. When I awoke I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">better. There was neither fever nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain, only great weakness. The nurse</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me I had been there three days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">delirious most of the time. A policeman</seg><seg type="columnLine">who knew me had found me in the Bow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery, slumped beside an "L" pillar, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sent me to the hospital in an am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulance. If I remained quiet I would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to leave soon--in two days per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I remained quiet,- all right. And I left</seg><seg type="columnLine">in two days. But, though in that time I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought often of the thing which had ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared and guided me in the storm, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not try to reason out what it was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It might have been a ghost, or a mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagining of my fever-racked brain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it didn't matter--then. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">point which possessed significance for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me was this: The first time I had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the counterfeit of Tsing, it had beck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oned me, caused me to make the search</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had located the old man's will.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the storm it had led me to a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I would be able to identify by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar doors. And I was determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find those doors. Any idea that "they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not exist, that I had imagined them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">never entered my mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">From my home I telephoned the Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">missioner. He was glad to learn of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovery and reported that no progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the case had been made. Apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mysterious doors must be located be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore we could make a new start. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, accompanied by Clancy, I searched</seg><seg type="columnLine">every foot of the three streets constitut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Chinatown, and failed to locate them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I did not lose faith in their exist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. So, before retiring, I located the</seg><seg type="columnLine">policeman who had found me in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">storm and learned that the exact place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I was picked up was in the centre</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a block of shabby structures, a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">half mile from the yellow quarter. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoned that I probably had seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors just before collapsing there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning after I was at the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost with the coming of daylight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My hunch proved 100 per cent. In less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than five minutes I had located what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought--a dilapidated, three-story struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, obviously used as a storehouse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, half of the lower floor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been reconstructed into a shop, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was occupied by a tailor. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">half showed only two large doors, held</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut by a staple and padlock. In an</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort to freshen the front of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, these doors had been painted a dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray, relieved by red stripes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the tailor I obtained the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">and address of the -owner, an attorney</seg><seg type="columnLine">in lower Broadway. Upon learning my</seg><seg type="columnLine">official standing, the latter replied read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily to my queries. The place, for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, had been rented for storage pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poses to a Chinese named Suing Lum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who ran a curio shop in Chinatown.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The mention of Chino Joe gave me a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of jolt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LEAVING him, I hastened to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter, located two detectives on</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty and took them with me to the mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still there, I had scarcely completed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that business when I received another</seg><seg type="columnLine">jolt--word by telephone that Tom, old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tsing's grandson, had been arrested at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Grand Central Terminal as he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alighting from a train.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he reached Headquarters--where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he greeted me like a long-lost friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but betrayed no sign that his arrest</seg><seg type="columnLine">worried him--I had him taken to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">office and sent his captors outside until</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had interviewed him. He told his</seg><seg type="columnLine">story frankly and quickly. After leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York he had gone directly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denver, where a distant cousin lived.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His object in going-there, where he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown, was to go to work in earnest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">establish himself under the eyes of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who knew both himself and his grand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">father and prove that this time his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form was genuine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is Chino Joe a friend of yours?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he shot back, frowning. I tpld</seg><seg type="columnLine">him what the man had told me about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gambling I. O. U.'s. "That's a lie,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "Joe hates me. He wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry Bow Ming-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What! Was he one of her suitors?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. The most persistent. He even</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatened my grandfather because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not consent that he should marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Not once, but many times. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">even tried to buy me off. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricked me. His friends got me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambling again. I lost heavily. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought my I. O. U.'s and threatened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take them to my grandfather if I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the city. I shouldn't have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, but I was in a panic. I feared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face my protector after I had lied to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and to Bow Ming. So I went West</seg><seg type="columnLine">--to prove by hard work I was truly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pentant. I wanted to earn money to</seg><seg type="columnLine">buy back the notes. To-" He stam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered, stopped, then buried his face in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Right then the solution of the case</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared as plain as daylight. Chino</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe had not only tricked Tom, but me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What a slick heathen! I swore to my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Self as I recalled how easily he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">duped me. He had driven Tom into hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. He had demanded the girl. Tsing</seg><seg type="columnLine">had refused and announced he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepare a document which, if anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to him, would put the Four</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brothers in charge of the girl. Joe had</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck quickly thereafter--killed Tsing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kidnaped Bow Ming. But he hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the will--the document which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have protected her from him, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he had squirmed out of a murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came a new thought which sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">me cold all over. Food, which I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned was being taken to the store-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house--was for Bow Ming! Telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom I would return soon and bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his release, I turned him over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waiting detectives, gathered three</seg><seg type="columnLine">huskies from the Bomb Squad and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started full speed for the warehouse in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">department automobile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But we were halted as we approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, by one of the men on guard. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just about to telephone me. Chino</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe had just driven up in a taxicab and</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the building. He appeared to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a great htirry. I cursed the Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">in good, round United States. The in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation meant that one of his spies</seg><seg type="columnLine">had learned of the arrest of Tom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had hastened to Bow Ming's prison</seg><seg type="columnLine">to spirit her away, or to force her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell him where Tsing had hidden his</seg><seg type="columnLine">will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LEARNING that the men previously</seg><seg type="columnLine">detailed by me had the place sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded--back, front and from the roofs</seg><seg type="columnLine">--so that none could leave it, I gave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">order that they were to move in closer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, at a signal from me, which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a pistol shot, they were to rush the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place from all sides. Leaving one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those I had brought, directly before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storehouse door, I headed for the tailor</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Its proprietor nearly collapsed at sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my badge. But, without explaining,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I frut him in charge of a dctective and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the third, tore open the trap and</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended to the cellar. Our flashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">played on all sides, over and behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great piles of boxes. Chino Joe was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden among them. Next we moved to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear. The door leading into the yard</seg><seg type="columnLine">was securely fastened. The Chinese had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left by some other means--probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a passage leading into the rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">shack. It took time, but finally we lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated what we sought. It was a pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage, about five feet in diameter, hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a huge crate cunningly held by hinges</seg><seg type="columnLine">which permitted it to be moved like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instructing my companion to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard at the entrance so that I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be interrupted from the rear, I stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead through the passage, trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make no noise and keeping the circle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my flash near my feet. My journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed endless. Then suddenly I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">mumbled cries--the voices of a man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman. Gripping my revolver,' I in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased my speed. 1 reached the foot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flight of rickety steps, stopped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened.

A man was shouting, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese. A woman was crying. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came shrieks and what I took to be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of blows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I covered the steps in bounds. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">door at the top was unlocked. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hallway of the shack. The voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from the floor above.

I noted that a bar which had held</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door fast from the outside leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall. Then came another</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry cry from the man, another blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a wild shriek from the girl. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">last sent me crazy with anger. Without</seg><seg type="columnLine">pausing to summon help, I placed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver against the keyhole and fired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the quickest way to break in. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash of falling metal followed the gun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">report--then startled cries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I	threw my shoulder against the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It gave way.

I roared, keeping him</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered while I helped the girl to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet.
