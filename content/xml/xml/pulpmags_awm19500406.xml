Out in the open prairie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a thousand yards behind him, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse stood with dropped reins. Slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly aside from the horse, a man's body</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned over and over on the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hit bad," mused Reno. Then be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause his experience with grief in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">multifold forms had taught him never</seg><seg type="columnLine">to forget his own safety, he added,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And if he dies, here I am right on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the premises to be accused of doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it." Looking back to the bench, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the ambusher at last wheel</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a dun-colored knob and vanish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he turned about, and his eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp blue against the clean smooth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of a bronze skin, quested the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail. As far as he could see, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about three miles, there was only emp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiness--good enough indication that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his recent maneuvering in the pocket-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed country had thrown the posse tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porarily off scent. He had, he supposed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a three-hour lead, and with that de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided, he slid back to his pony and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode out of the arroyo. Aiming for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen one, he shook his head with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mild feeling of contempt for his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Probably get shot for my pains,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he observed. "Posse behind, fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a rifle up on the bench, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor devil dyin' out there--him no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt thinkin' I'm the one that got</seg><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did, then, a characteristic thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He grinned, and the grin lightened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured and rather hard cast of his fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures. The pressed severity of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth was released, small weather</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrinkles deepened about the eyes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once a touch of ironic, uncaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">recklessness lay revealed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three hundred feet from the prone</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure, he checked in, straightening his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall, fiat torso. The fellow had showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sign of life. One hand reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward. A dark and pointed face be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came distinct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Easy," called Reno. "I didn't dry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulch you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A surprisingly strong voice came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the man. "I know that. Come on</seg><seg type="columnLine">up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reno crossed the interval and slip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped to the ground, immediately feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">a profound pity. Here was a young,</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnificently set-up body, long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lean and powerful. But it was shatter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed now beyond repair. There wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">any hope--the man was going out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Telltale sweat streaked the dark skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a grayish pallor mottled it. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then one long leg lifted from a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flex of pain. All that remained strongly</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive were the eyes. The light that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out of them was vital, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiercely intense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take care of yourself," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. "Look and see if--if he's still in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. He pulled out after the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot. Now, old trapper, we've got to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in a hurry. I'll lift you--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the man shook his head, a slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and'grim gesture of defeat. "Leave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. I'd fall to pieces."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're sure of that?" asked Reno,</seg><seg type="columnLine">profoundly stirred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had seen men die before--often</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, in fact, to have developed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep and quiet sense of fatalism that</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored all his thoughts and sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him seem callous to suffering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But here was a man dying as a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to die--without fear and with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out crying. The bright black glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was actually defiant. It was sad to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">such fine courage wasted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a stranger," grunted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Anything I can do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you're no fool, you'll never stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">till this cursed country is behind you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the man with a heavy bitterness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know who got you?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know," said the other. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed his lips together, and Reno un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood that the name of the killer</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never come out. On impulse</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno rose and got his canteen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tipped it to the man's lips. Afterwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took off his hat and shaded the up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bound anywhere in particular?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked the fellow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you want a message delivered,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Reno, "I'll carry it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fellow's eyes closed. He said</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly, "Go to Morgantown and find</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Lafe McMurtree. Tell him. Tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">him Two-bits is dead. Tell him--it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rifle shot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That all?" asked Reno.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take my gun with you.

"No</seg><seg type="columnLine">infonnation as to who did it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you tell him exactly what I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you," the man said faintly, "he'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reno's deep sympathy moved him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say something then that he never</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have said to another person.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When you cross ihe Jordan ferry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend, the valley beyond will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">green with grass and freshly watered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It'll be a pleasant place to camp. Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there no woman you'll want to send a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word to?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me?" muttered the other. "A Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murtree? What woman cares for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">black tribe? There's only one in all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills to grieve. She shouldn't, for we've</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt her ever since she was a kid. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">she'll think kindly of me long after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest have forgotten."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Open your mouth," said Reno, tip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping the canteen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was no obeying gesture</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Reno, looking down with a close</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity, saw the other's lids slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">relax and creep partially open. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew then, even before he laid his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand across that broad chest, what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer was--the fellow had drifted on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rising slowly, Reno replaced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canteen and reached for his cigarette</seg><seg type="columnLine">tobacco. Along his lean jaws appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sudden tightness and the rest of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">features took sharper and harder form</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the unconscious reaction of a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who hated injustice. For at twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five, with the rather bitter and rough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-tumble experiences of his life to</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw from, he still possessed the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctive fighter's sense of fairness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another good hand ridin' into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunset too soon," he muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lifting his eyes then, he saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day was drawing to a close, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminded him of the fact that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">losing good minutes. He could do noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing more here. His position was dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous. His promise to the dead man</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid him wide open to further uncer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty. Nor could he undertake to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move the fellow to the nearest town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That chore, he realized, would be done</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the posse now undoubtedly-closing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. What he had to do in short order</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to put the miles behind and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch with an increasing vigilance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reaching down, he got the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's gun--a forty-five with a worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip that had a star-and-crescent inlay</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mother-of-pearl--and stowed it in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddlebag. Then he swung up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined out to the westward at a strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">canter. Another rear glance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEUDISTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, he reflected soberly, this whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">business is bad for me. I'm a stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'm mixed up in something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably has a lot of strings tied to it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This range is different from no other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whoever wanted that fellow dead will</seg><seg type="columnLine">move a lot of dirt to put the job on me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can expect to be challenged any time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the sun fell beneath the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was a good eight miles off in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths of a land that ran west and</seg><seg type="columnLine">south without visible break--a free</seg><seg type="columnLine">and open range, pleasant to the rider's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye. To the north the tawny bench still</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralleled him, increasing in rugged-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and backed up by a considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">range of hills that swung forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the distance. Just as dusk fell he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked behind again and thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made out the posse far off. Then dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness came with a rush and he laid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandy mites beneath him one by one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By degrees the bench began to curve</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and he followed along that bend</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the general belief that the town</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sought, which was Blackrock, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere ahead with one face show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the prairie and the other con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fronting the hills. Around the bend he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw it in the shape of twinkling lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">all aglimmer across the flats, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">about eight o'clock he entered the nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row central street of this range settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A double row of locust trees ran the</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of the street, deepening the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy and accenting the warmth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those lamplight lanes gushing out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buildings. A saloon blazed brilliant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly near by, men walked indolently be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the porch roofs, there was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of guitar and fiddle somewhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coming upon a water trough, Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno let his pony drink sparingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then rode into the adjacent stable's</seg><seg type="columnLine">runway. When he dismounted a hos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tler advanced from the darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Grain him," said Reno, "but keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saddle on him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hostler's face came closer, thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inquisitive. "Keep the saddle on?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," replied Reno shortly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew that so simple an order ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed his hand, and he knew too that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the news would spread. All these</seg><seg type="columnLine">towns were alike, alert and suspicious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighing strangers in the light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">factional politics. Such deliberate plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he had laid were worthless now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made so by the death of that rider on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prairie, and he could only guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself from one uncertain situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another. Understanding this, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">strolled into a restaurant and ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a meal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only thing I'm stire of, he reflected</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his eggs and bacon, is that nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">will recognize me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterward he went back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street, fashioning a cigarette in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows. Half a dozen townsmen sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the porch steps to his immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and talked in drawling syllables.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The casual strollers drifted in and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the saloon across the way. But as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he paused in his tracks, debating with</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, he noticed one man walk from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that saloon with an air of purpose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">come across. He passed Reno at arm's</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance, not seeing him, and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight to the stable, there turning in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It meant nothing, it meant anything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno held his place, on guard. A little</seg><seg type="columnLine">later the man emerged from the stable</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strode back to the saloon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thought so," said Reno to himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dragged a deep draught of smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his lungs. He had wondered about</seg><seg type="columnLine">making his appearance in the saloon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he realized now that it was a nec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">essary step. Somebody was showing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity which he himself had to sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isfy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fve got, he reflected, about one hour.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Posse will be here then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He went over and shouldered</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the swinging doors. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar across the rear he ordered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisky and, dawdling against the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hogany, studied the place through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror behind it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was comfortably filled, this room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smoke hung thickly from the ceiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">like ropes of moss, and riders tramped</seg><seg type="columnLine">around with the leisurely restlessness</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rises from a full stomach and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">free night. A half-dozen poker tables</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in full play. Two floormen moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly through the crowd and some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body called rather sharply: "Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">sevens will take this pot."

That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. The trio split and the addressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">party strolled from the place. Reno</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid his bill thoughtfully and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.

"You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookin' at my foreman, Hale Wolfert."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno swung his glance over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaker. He was a big man with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, nut-shaped head which bore sly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sharp Yankee features.

"Then who are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pete Vilas," said the man.

He stepped back, flattening</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the building wall. From that</seg><seg type="columnLine">position he saw a dozen riders come</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the street double file.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to bury him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its depths, yet more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than two miles out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blackrock the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick tilt of the bench lifted him to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crest from which he saw again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights of the town. After that the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">tackled earnestly an increasing grade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for long intervals Reno's pony</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on at a slogging walk. A bank of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fog drifted thickly about him. Beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">that level he was in the pure darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tree country, and all around him</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay a profound stillness and mystery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He realized he had put the bench</seg><seg type="columnLine">definitely behind him. This now was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scarp of that distant range he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen during the day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He went on for better than two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours through the windings of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorge, until its walls began to spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther apart. Shortly afterward he</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed what was apparently another</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail running due south along a minor</seg><seg type="columnLine">crest of the hills. Not knowing which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the proper way to Morgantown,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he paused briefly to study it out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then pressed on with the assumption</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the straight course was the like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liest. But he had not gone far when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was warned that the trail had other</seg><seg type="columnLine">riders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warning came abrupt and clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the hind quarter, in the shape of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponies' feet striking fast and hard on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail. He had only time enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd his own mount against a side</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of the gorge when they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating up and by. Crouched there in</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEUDISTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">11</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the saddle, an arm reached across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal's nostrils, he made out one</seg><seg type="columnLine">rearing shadow after another passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward into the gloom. Quick dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled out and touched him, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noise of their travel died in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twelve or fifteen of them," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half aloud, "and they came out of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">side trail.

This is the sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of country I thought it might be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At twenty-five, Reno was well aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fact that any land of night rid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers would be a land of subterfuge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was what he had pushed into--</seg><seg type="columnLine">subterfuge and uncertainty to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of considerable danger. As for</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, he could play it cautious or he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could play it reckless, but the one nec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">essary thing was to tie himself, by one</seg><seg type="columnLine">means or another, into the life of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills. He could accomplish no part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own plan as long as he remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">an outlander.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, he mused, I better play it slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckless.

Nobody will rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ognize me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gorge spread all at once into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small valley and as Reno went down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curving grade he was again bathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a fog thick enough to be stirred by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his passage. This, added to the dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a blinding element and he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">only let the horse choose its route.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long afterward--he judged it to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">another two miles--he felt the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise. From the distance a rumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound began to lift and reverberate</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the night. Presently he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the fog and caught the faintly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">etched outline of trees against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black sky. But the road sheered away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went directly toward the rush and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutter of a waterfall. He thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the twinkle of a light ahead, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it vanished swiftly. Then the hoofs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his horse suddenly woke loud drum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming echoes as the animal crossed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plank bridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He checked the horse to a slow drift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and said casually, "All right."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who is it?" said the voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The name is Reno--Jim Reno."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where from?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Blackrock."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little silence ensued, broken final-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly by a throaty oath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Either you're lyin' or you've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nerve of a brass monkey!

A gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammer clicked.

"I said I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the size of these messages?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded the spokesman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That happens to be none of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">business," stated Reno with an even</seg><seg type="columnLine">severity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Might be some questions as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that," grunted the spokesman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a milder voice came up from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear. "We better take him in, The'-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dore."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me handle this," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spokesman in no pleasant manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then handle it and quit talkin',"</seg><seg type="columnLine">retorted the mild one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," growled the spokesman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"we'll take him to Big Lafe's."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a command, Reno moved forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the lantern bearer trudging be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side him. A horseman came suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">abreast on the other side and showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">one knife-scarred cheek in the light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was, Reno realized, the fellow who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done all the talking. Roan-colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair showed along the man's temple</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his eyes had a Mongol narrowness</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them. Nothing more was said. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern bearer abruptly extinguished</seg><seg type="columnLine">his light and went off. Presently the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of the unseen group came milling</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the road, now asaddle, and, thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">escorted, Reno trotted past a dense</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of timber and on toward a beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light glimmering from a house</seg><seg type="columnLine">window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cavalcade ignored it and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a lesser and more abysmally sight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less route. It shot upward precipitous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, high into a windier world. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the group turned again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went single file along the barren spine</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a ridge. Twenty minutes later the</seg><seg type="columnLine">course fell down the side of a canyon</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a small creek went rioting be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween jagged walls. Reno, trying to es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tablish the windings of this trail in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, finally gave up with the feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the leader of the party was delib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erately complicating the thing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling became certainty when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted up another stiff slope and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a momentary halt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One rider trotted on for a way, spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">a subdued phrase and called back, "All</seg><seg type="columnLine">right." The party moved ahead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a quarter mile came upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing. At the far end sat a house all</seg><seg type="columnLine">aglow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A pack of hounds charged forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">in full throat, swirling about the feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the horses. At the porch a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men stepped from the shadows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood silently alert. The spokesman</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured something indistinct do</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and pointed at Reno, who got</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the saddle and walked forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the same time a door swung open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Urged by the spokesman's shove, Reno</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed into what was the largest room</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had ever seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was fully three-quarters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower floor of this sprawling structure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Above it, reached by a winding stair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEUDISTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> case, an overhanging gallery ran</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> around the four sides; and off this gal-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lery opened a series of doors. Reno,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sizing it up, thought the place more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> like a barracks than a ranch house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this was only a quickly passing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> reflection, for his attention crossed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the room to the huge fireplace beneath</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the far gallery and fastened itself to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the man standing there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    The'dore, the spokesman, said blunt-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ly, "There's Big Lafe," and Reno walk-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ed on until the grateful heat of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  fire touched him and Big Lafe was but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  a yard away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Big Lafe once had been mighty in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his proportions.

His hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">clasped behind him, thus throwing for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward a fine, high pair of shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">; His thews were pi'onounced, his bones</seg><seg type="columnLine">well covered, his chest soundly arched.</seg><seg type="columnLine">[ Well over six feet, he had the tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's habit of bowing his head to les-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ser men.

Big Lafe McMurtree slowly unclasp-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ed his hands and .swung about to kick</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  a log deeper into the fire.

"Vilas--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows about this?" demanded the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I never mentioned it to him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hand came back from outside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No gun in either saddlebag," he called</seg><seg type="columnLine">accusingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reno whirled around and demanded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who's been monkeyin' with my gear?</seg><seg type="columnLine">That gun was there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Big Lafe's voice took on a definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone of authority. His words cracked</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the room. "The'dore, where is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The'dore's chin raised. In the light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face seemed more unprepossessing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more slanting than by the brief rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lantern. The knife-scar made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long evil track across one cheek and</seg><seg type="columnLine">those Mongol eyes were narrower than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. He said, a little sullenly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nobody has touched that horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">since I caught this man. If you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">my opinion, the man lies!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Reno," said Big Lafe slowly, "where</seg><seg type="columnLine">else could that gun have gone?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I left the horse in Blackrock's stable</seg><seg type="columnLine">for half an hour. I wonder-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No need to wonder " interrupted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Lafe grimly. "It was lifted there."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You believe that cock-and-bull</seg><seg type="columnLine">story?" The'dore asked of Big Lafe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be silent," snapped Big Lafe. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked to Reno and some of the rigid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness went out of his manner. "I thank</seg><seg type="columnLine">you for telling me. It was my nephew</seg><seg type="columnLine">you gave the drink of water to. You've</seg><seg type="columnLine">done your chore. What next?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be riding on," said Reno.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Out of the country?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reno shook his head. "No. I'll be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hills for a while."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not in these hills," interrupted</seg><seg type="columnLine">The'dore. "Nobody rides these hills un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less we say so."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEUDISTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Unless who says so?" challenged</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Lafe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Unless you say so," amended The-</seg><seg type="columnLine">'dore, after a long, tight pause. Look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about, Reno saw The'dore's jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">work into lines of balky stubbornness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Lafe said abruptly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Reno, have you ever been in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the country before?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think," said Big Lafe, "you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying. But we shall soon find out. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have, there is one pair of eyes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this house that will recognize you-no</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter how long you might've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Rae!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The silence settled again. Big Lafe</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung half about, facing a door that</seg><seg type="columnLine">led back from the lower floor to an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner room. Behind Reno was the utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet of men expecting something im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant to happen. And with this feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in his bones--the feeling that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fortunes depended on the next mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment--he stiffened himself. That door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened softly and a woman stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, to pause there. Immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward Reno's set muscles loosened</seg><seg type="columnLine">with astonishment. In this house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">among this rough crew, was actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was no more than twenty-five.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A mass of black hair sat loosely above</seg><seg type="columnLine">a broad white forehead. Below that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were slim, slightly olive features and</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes that were dark and alive and full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vital fire. She was straight, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">graceful sureness of a splendid body</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing through the loose riding-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes she wore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she said, "What is it, Dad?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throaty richness of the words fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Reno's ears like pleasant music.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rae," said Big Lafe, "have you ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">at any time seen this man before?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her glance turned on him and re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mained steady and solemn. Reno stif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fened again and a blankness settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his cheeks. He saw her lips part</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly. She seemed to bend forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avhile she studied him, to collect every</seg><seg type="columnLine">item of his individuality in that long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">long survey. Without any doubt some</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick reaction took place in her, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hands half rose and fell. Then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned her head swiftly toward Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lafe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," she said in a kind of breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less tone. "I never have."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never?" challenged The'dore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never," said the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's all," put in Big Lafe. "If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say j^ou have never seen him, then he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stranger. Your memory is longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any I ever knew."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She started to turn back. Big Lafe</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared his throat and said slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Two-bits is dead, Rae."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl started, whirled about. Reno</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw her eyes widen in pure pain, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then fill. But a moment later she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, closing the door behind her. Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lafe spoke once more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll stay here tonight, Reno. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">show you a room. The'dore, see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his horse is put up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He belongs in the tool shed," mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered The'dore, "with a couple of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">guardin' him. You're foolish to trust--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">But*Big Lafe swept that aside with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ironic calm. "I'll run the McMurtree</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs a few years longer yet, The-</seg><seg type="columnLine">'dore. Reno, come with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taking up a near-by lamp, he slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed the stairs and turned along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gallery. At one open door he halt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, passed the lamp to the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno, and bowed courteously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Trust you rest well," he said. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are a smart man, Reno. You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than appears on the record. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I do not doubt you have your own pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">16</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">poses to serve. For tonight we'll let</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What purpose," asked Reno with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">show of idle curiosity, "would be bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me to this country?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't know," answered Big Lafe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But they'll soon be disclosed. No man</seg><seg type="columnLine">can go it alone up here. Remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. You're nobody's fool. Vilas picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to do a chore--and he knows men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So do I."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're thinking maybe I'll be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your way?" suggested Reno.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Remains to be seen," said Big Lafe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked more closely at Reno.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There is," he added with a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowness, "a slight possibility you</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be a help to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When you've got it figured out,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Reno, "let me know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reno nodded and went in, closing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door: He placed the lamp on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small table by the bed, sat on the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that bed, and slowly removed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">boots. Big Lafe's solid footsteps re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated down the stairway and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a rising hum of voices from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, broken by one angry accent that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted and fell. In the adjoining room</seg><seg type="columnLine">a board squeaked slightly, bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno's narrowed eyes toward the flim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sy partition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the boot in his hand, he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, crossed to the only window, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that point of view looked into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ranch yard. A man was at this mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment leading his horse to the barn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nearer at hand he saw a second fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolidly draped against a corral fence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The meaning of this one's location was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear enough. Pulling the shade down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno walked back to the bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This much of it is accomplished,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said slowly to himself. "It's a be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning--nothing more. The rest of it's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">going to be a lot harder."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His thoughts were broken by a soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">drumming of finger tips against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. Once more riveting his attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, he saw what he had not noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">before--the four thin seams of a door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way in that boarded surface, a door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way without latch or keyhole or knob.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saying nothing--for the softness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal sounded to him more like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning than an announcement--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat quite still. In the next moment the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall door swung open and Rae Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murtree stood before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         Chapter Four</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         Memory Rides</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NE white hand rose in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gesture of caution</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her eyes flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly over toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drawn shade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you do-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ing here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Delivering a mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage to your dad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She waved that aside with an impa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tient gesture of her small hand. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">else?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To deliver another one you prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably didn't hear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it is to be told," answered Reno,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"your dad will probably do the tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had been crying.

There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one woman to grieve for a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">McMurtree. This, Reno suddenly real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized, was the woman, and she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">grieving. It prompted a gentler speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his part.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That young lad--that Two-bits boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEUDISTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">17</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was thinking of you when he died."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Stop it!" said Rae.

The dark, level eyes held</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attention relentlessly.

Going to the window then, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the guard still posted by the cor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ral and presently saw The'dore come</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the house corner and leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">some terse order with the man. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of the people of the ranch seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have settled for the night; no sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke the pervading quiet inside this</seg><seg type="columnLine">castle of the hills. Treading the narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">confines of his room, the last of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigarette sputtering between'his lips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno thought out his position with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">studious intensity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One thing, he reflected, appears</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain. The old man runs affairs, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's got opposition on the part of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">The'dore. That may mean something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Depends on how the rest of the crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw their vote.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterward he ground the stump of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cigarette between his fingers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled in for a welcome sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Breakfast was a glum affair in a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">mess hall back of the main room. Reno</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the strength of the McMurtree</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch for the first time and was mildly</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonished at the number of hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">present. There were, his quick count</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him, more than twenty-five men</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the place and that meant another</seg><seg type="columnLine">half dozen out on remote chores. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff and stern Big Lafe, who sat at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of the table and drank a sparing</seg><seg type="columnLine">cup of coffee, had thirty ready guns at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his command. The'dore sat at the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite end of the table, from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstance Reno judged that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sullen one was more or less of a fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. The'dore's cast of features was</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasingly dour and his eyes con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained a sleepy surliness as if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been up most of the night. The girl, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her father's immediate right, never</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced Reno's way during the meal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After breakfast Reno strolled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big hall. Then, nothing being said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he went out into the crisp early</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunshine that flooded the long mead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEUDISTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ow. It was a high meadow, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hint of sharply descending slopes be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the timber. The air was thin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich and Reno's cigarette had a fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">savor to it. Yet as he idled toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">string of outbuildings he felt a portent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trouble coming from behind. None</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the McMurtree people were to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen; all of them had remained in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. Hoisting himself to the top rail</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a corral, he presently saw them</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the house and from the scowling</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner in which they broke across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard, he knew they had been in a hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heavy session. Big Lafe remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the porch, his daughter with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The'dore strode on to the barn and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little while Reno saw a group of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding the foreman, all talking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno's ready mind leaped at the inevi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table conclusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Right there is the opposition. Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lafe's hostile foreman has got ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">followers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His thoughts were broken by the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's voice booming across the yard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Get out a couple horses, The'dore!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't stand there dreamin'!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The'dore wrenched himself away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the group with an obstinate twist</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his shoulders. The girl left the porch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came on toward Reno, slapping a</seg><seg type="columnLine">romal carelessly against her breeches</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg. A small felt hat sat insouciantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">back on the dark head, and a beaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian jacket made a bright play of</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors. But when she stopped in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Reno he saw the sober cloud run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning across her eyes and the serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursing of her lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're going for a little ride," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reno chuckled and slid down from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corral.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who," he wanted to know, "is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">escort and who is the escorted?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That broke her gravity. She smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly back at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The gentleman usually escorts the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The horses came up, led by a morose-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced man who dropped the reins and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalked away. In complete silence they</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode to the tree line and went single</seg><seg type="columnLine">file down a twisted trail that buckled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the bottom of a canyon and climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the far side. It was a mile or more be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore they came to the heights of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge and were able to ride abreast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's some purpose to this sash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ay?" queried Reno.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rae looked at him, again bending</seg><seg type="columnLine">that intent scrutiny on his features.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a moment, she said, "Are you al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways digging for purposes, Jim?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've traveled pretty much alone,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered Reno, with considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfulness, "and have found little</seg><seg type="columnLine">charity along the way. Somebody al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways wants something. It's been my</seg><seg type="columnLine">policy to find out what. I've had to."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And you've turned into a man that</seg><seg type="columnLine">runs before a posse," she said rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitterly. "What did you do? Was it</seg><seg type="columnLine">very bad?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not a full-fledged outlaw,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawled Reno. "Let it go like that."</seg><seg type="columnLine">They wore riding south along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge and from time to time past</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping vistas of the far-off Crossjack</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain. A few miles farther, during</seg><seg type="columnLine">which time not more than half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">words had been spoken, the girl swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an apparent aimlessness to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">westward and they came upon a lesser</seg><seg type="columnLine">spur leading off toward that plain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My father," said the girl after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prolonged silence, "is a proud man. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">some ways too proud. He looks back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward--always backward. Somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Southern states there is a fam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily plantation and a family record that</seg><seg type="columnLine">20</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lists the McMurtrees clear into Queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elizabeth's time. One McMurtree was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a captain in Drake's fleet. One was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">general in the Revolution. One was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">senator. These are the things he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">members."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And it's made him a little bitter?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl's voice filled with energy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why shouldn't it? Until twenty years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago he was an honest man, a wealthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, with a great ranch out there on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that plain. He pioneered that country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the robbers came and the cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">war came and they fought him until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bankrupt and they drove him up</seg><seg type="columnLine">here with nothing to his name. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been fighting him ever since.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, what could he do but fight back?</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the thing that hurts most is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has had to fight as they fought--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that kind of fighting is without</seg><seg type="columnLine">honesty. Do you see now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Reno, then thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">something else. "Who is this The-</seg><seg type="columnLine">'dore?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She flashed him a swift, sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance. "You are quick to observe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aren't you? The'dore is our foreman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He came with us about two years ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He is the only man"--her voice sank a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little as she said it--"on the ranch who</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not in some way related to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She drew up then, for they had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a point of land that fell sheerly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">an off-running glen. A half mile be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond was a sweep of open meadow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a group of buildings, gray and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jointed in the bright sunshine. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl pointed with a gloved hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke again, more to herself than to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's the sort of thing that hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pens in this country. Once upon a time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago, a family lived on that place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were rich. They were respected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But when the cattle war came along</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they were between fires, too close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hills, too close to tfie plain. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man tried to be neutral, and conse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently everybody hated him. So one</seg><seg type="columnLine">night somebody ambushed Hi Benton</seg><seg type="columnLine">and killed him. His wife and little boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to move out. I used to play with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that boy. I have often wondered what</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reno looked down at the place with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out visible expression. The silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengthened out until it became strain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed; and the girl at last said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I have brought back unpleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories, Jim, I'm sorry. Only you</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot pretend to me. Not to me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno looked at her. "All right, Rae.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here's Hi Benton's son back home.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's been a great many years. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing's changed. I haven't got exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same body, the same face, nor the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same mind. How did you recognize</seg><seg type="columnLine">me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind," murmured the girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps it is because I always ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected you to come back. Perhaps there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were things I never forgot--about you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the moment I stepped into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and saw you, I knew. As it was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I almost betrayed you--almost called</seg><seg type="columnLine">your right name."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a minute. We've got to get this</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight. I was Jim Benton until three</seg><seg type="columnLine">months ago. When I decided to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">into this country I changed my name.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had to do that. I had to get a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">name and a new frame of mind so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody would ever come up behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, call out my old name, and take me</seg><seg type="columnLine">off guard. I went to another country as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Reno. I practiced on that name</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it was more mine than the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. Then I lit out for here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you changed your habits, too?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked the girl, a little forlornly. "To</seg><seg type="columnLine">the extent that you came here with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEUDISTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">posse on your heels? I'm sorry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't be too sorry," he warned her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is a dangerous game I'm play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What game?" asked the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You ought to know what would</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring me back. When Dad was killed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mother and I had to leave. That hurt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rae. It's been hurting ever since. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">could a woman and a small kid do? We</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to another valley, and I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow up and become the man of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">family. All these years I've had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">killing of my dad on my mind. Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot it, never let it die. Mother had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pretty tough time. But she always</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid taxes on this old place, just to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep it up. We never knew who used it</seg><seg type="columnLine">or lived in it. Still, we kept it. When I</seg><seg type="columnLine">got old enough, she made me promise</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to come here. She was afraid. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept the promise--right up till she</seg><seg type="columnLine">died, about six months ago. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made my plans." His voice chilled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 he spoke more slowly. "I'm back now</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find out who killed Dad. That's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole story."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your mother was right," breathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl. "You shouldn't be here. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">will never be able to uncover that mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery. And if you do, you will be killed."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shook his head. "That's why I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. I don't think I'll ever leave this</seg><seg type="columnLine">land again. Now remember, Rae. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">name is Jim Reno. Even when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of me, think of me as Reno, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that your tongue won't slip. I've put</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old name behind me.

"Who uses the ranch</seg><seg type="columnLine">now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's free range," said the girl,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"though there's always cattle grazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it and usually some party or an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other using it for occasional shelter."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Rae, what's the gossip around here</seg><seg type="columnLine">--about my dad's death?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only whispers," replied the girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You've got to realize, Jim, that no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body cared much about you people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The McMurtrees didn't trust your fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther because he didn't have anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do with them. The Vilas faction, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I get it, was always more or less afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him. That's all I know.

Afterward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick forest enveloped them and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">past high noon when they cantered in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the McMurtree clearing.

Thus, when at</seg><seg type="columnLine">about four o'clock The'dore came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the bunkhouses and went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main house .gt a rapid stride, Reno felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half relief and a half excitements</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The'dore walked in with the swag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gering sureness of one whose power</seg><seg type="columnLine">was certain enough to depend on.

After that, quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned, but the McMurtree crew be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to appear in the yard, two at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. One of these ostentatiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked to the barn and there halted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Half a dozen strolled indolently toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main-house porch and took station</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. The rest of the outfit straggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from point to point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this, however, was changed when</seg><seg type="columnLine">The'dore again made his appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the porch. His voice lifted through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quiet afternoon like the echo of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brazen horn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Billy, you stay at the stable. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body else come in here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In response, all the men went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house with an ill-concealed alacrity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except that one nearest Reno. He came</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer and leaned against the barn</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It'll be all right, I suppose," drawl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed Reno ironically, "if I scratch my</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man only glowered and contin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ued his open watchfulness. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds of high and angry talk from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main house. Sharp echoes rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the yard. Time passed dragging-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEUDISTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ly and even the guard began to fiddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his tracks. Looking at his watch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno was surprised to find it was after</seg><seg type="columnLine">five. A short time later the meeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke up and the crew appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The'dore strode toward the corrals</seg><seg type="columnLine">with part of the outfit compactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him and Reno, studying all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a deep watchfulness, thought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this group accompanying the foreman</seg><seg type="columnLine">was larger than the one he had ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served in the morning. The rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunch followed to the corrals more</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. Some of them separated and</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed in the direction of the bunk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses. When those men came to view</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, they were armed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Meanwhile heavy dust rolled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the corrals. Fresh ponies were led</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the yard, saddled and left stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing by the main house porch. The'dore</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke a subdued word to a pair of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">near him and these, immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounting, went away to the south just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the supper triangle began to beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">up brassy eddies of sound. Without</seg><seg type="columnLine">further invitation, Reno went in to eat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he returned again to the porch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun had fallen and dusk was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrouding the sky. Big Lafe came</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the door and stood beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll ride with the men tonight,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Where to and what for?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The question will answer itself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">due course," said Big Lafe. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">added, "You are entitled to a reason,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course. The men feel that if you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">a party to possible trouble this evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll be in the middle of it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Sound politics," applauded Reno</seg><seg type="columnLine">dryly. "I take it I'm not free to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">this ranch, and I'm even less welcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stay."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Your coming here has brought a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">complication I never expected," said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Big Lafe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "McMurtree," replied Reno, unex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pectedly frank, "take this for what it's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">worth. If you expect to deal the same</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brand of cards you been dealin' for a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">number of years, you better get an-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other jack of spades. The card is worn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out, full of thumb marks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  McMurtree turned and started to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">speak, but was prevented by the ap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pearance of the outfit filing across the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "All right, Reno," called The'dore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Here's your rig."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "The'dore," said Big Lafe, "I'll be go-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing with you. Get my pony."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The'dore sat back in the saddle and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grunted his surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It will be the first time in a coon's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">age. What for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "When I get to the point of explain-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing my mind to you," said Big Lafe, "it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will be a sorry world. Get my pony."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"There's no need of it," argued The-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'dore. "I'm able to take care of this. If</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you want it plain, I'd like you to stay</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">here. We travel fast."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Damn you--get my pony! " boomed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Big Lafe. "When I speak I intend to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be obeyed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The'dore let out a great gust of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">breath, but said nothing. A man on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one flank of the party silently wheeled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">away to the barn. A wind ran gently</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">across the porch and Reno, all at once</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">full of admiration for this old, hard-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bitten wolf of the hills, saw Big Lafe's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">% grizzled hair ruff up on nis head. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man stood there like a rock, implaca-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ble and without the knowledge of fear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or physical weakness. He spoke again</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to his foreman with cutting calm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You are growing too big for your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pants, The'dore. On my pay sheet</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you're listed as a command hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't forget that and don't make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary for me to have to remind</seg><seg type="columnLine">you of it again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The day is about gone," said The-</seg><seg type="columnLine">'dore, with rage tightening his throat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"when you can speak to me like that!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here and now I warn you against</seg><seg type="columnLine">tryin' it again!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll take it and you'll like it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped Big Lafe, his voice as cold as</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the rest of the outfit seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">quit breathing. Rae came out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall, coming between her father and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno. The rider came back with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man's horse and held the reins out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The'dore said, almost under his breath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right," and spurred away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the group. Big Lafe walked slowly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his saddle and climbed up. Reno, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the verge of following, heard the girl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bated whisper:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't let The'dore ride beside you</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reno left the porch and stepped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leather. At that the group wheeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, two and two, led by The'dore</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Big Lafe, and cantered across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meadow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two miles of steady pacing in star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit darkness ended without warning in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a complete halt. A sibilant murmur</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran along the line and certain men</seg><seg type="columnLine">detached themselves from it and trot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted ahead. Cow smell came up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind. Then the cavalcade pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into another of the countless depres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions and within the space of minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were on the sides of a compact#</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of cattle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The herd had been previously</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunched and made ready. That much</seg><seg type="columnLine">was plain to Reno. What also was plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him was that Big Lafe's outfit had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done this enough times before to have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">perfected a discipline that needed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">added commanding. The group shifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">left and right until there was only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single man at Reno's side--and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">one obviously instructed to remain so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A lantern suddenly flashed and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out after describing a complete circle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At that signal cattle and men moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, downgrade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somewhere ahead The'dore called</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, "Billy!" and the man beside Reno</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered, "It's all right." Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">rider cut back and came up on Reno's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pther flank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got this taken care of," an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced Billy with a trace of belliger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you trying to do?" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Lafe's still voice. "Notify the coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try we're abroad tonight? Get the hell</seg><seg type="columnLine">up forward and tell The'dore to shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," grumbled Billy. "Didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know it was you." He pulled away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished among the shadows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clearing fell into a long decline</seg><seg type="columnLine">with gentle slopes rising on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, an admirable runway for night</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving. All this had the earmarks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtful planning. By the feel of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass moving ahead, Reno judged that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were no more than a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">head in the bunch, which was a two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">01* three-man job instead of a job need-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the present twenty-odd hands. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">extra hands, he concluded, were meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">for trouble--the trouble that comes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving stolen cattle by night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was an old story and he pieced</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the rest of it with no great strain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thinking. The stock had been gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered a few head at a time, thrown into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secret pocket, and held there until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the herd was made. What went on now</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a drive to some receiver elsewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hills who would push the beef</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEUDISTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on to market. Big Lafe McMurtree, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">descendent of captains and statesmen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had turned to this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're letting me into the whole</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">story, McMurtree," Reno remarked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a long time before Big Lafe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">answered. "There was a date in his-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tory," he finally muttered, "when a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brigand was considered a good citizen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Writers wrote stories about them. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">don't hold any such illusions. A cattle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thief is a cattle thief, which is what I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">am. But what lies behind all this Is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">something you don't know. You see</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">damned little of the story here. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rest will come soon enough."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A rider pushed his way back beside</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the old man and murmured something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">indistinct. Big Lafe said, "Turn short</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at Sweetgrass Creek and go across the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bridge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rider went forward again and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">presently the momentum of the herd</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was temporarily checked. The flank</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">men began to crowd against the cattle,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">romals slapping down. Reno, coming</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">along the dusty rear, felt the ground</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">•	shift upward and later downward as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the trail bent. At the end of three tedi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ous miles Reno found the unbroken</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">expanse of the prairie lying below and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beyond. He knew then where he was,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for in the distance--in the far western</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">distance--the lights of Blackrock</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">winked through the gloom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These cattle, he thought, were prob-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ably rustled from that prairie. Now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they're going back to the prairie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Which is damned odd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardly had he come to the conclu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sion when a signal flash appeared off</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the immediate left--a lantern un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cloaked and held high. In another mo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment it was concealed again, but the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">circling McMurtree hands had seen the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">warning and instantly began rounding</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the herd to check it. The light appear-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ed again, more briefly; a rider came</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back from the head of the column and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reined in beside Big Lafe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The'dore's voice said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come along," answered Big Lafe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two of them turned abreast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">aimed for that point where the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been. Reno, mind racing down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">channels of his own scheming, wheeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and retreated a good fifty yards. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">he halted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There's the receiver of the stolen</seg><seg type="columnLine">goods, he thought. Him with the light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But what the hell? What's the point in</seg><seg type="columnLine">running the beef back to where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once the light rose straight from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth and he dimly viewed the form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that third party, the receiver. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light went out. There was a parley go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on, a very short parley terminated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Big Lafe's voice calling calmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, "All right, boys."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hands began to drift toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno. The job was done, the transfer</seg><seg type="columnLine">made. On the sharp lookout, Reno saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Lafe and The'dore appear in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If I want to get out of this outfit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno warned himself, here is the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance I'll ever have. If I stay on, I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have The'dore to handle before another</seg><seg type="columnLine">day's done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the McMurtree han'ds, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gathered a few yards away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sitting still in their saddles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">queerly still and speechless. Big Lafe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and The'dore advanced at a trot, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the length of ten yards one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them--Reno thought it was The'dore--</seg><seg type="columnLine">swerved aside and went on at a slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly faster pace. A low, cautious call rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the McMurtree ranks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say--Lafe. Where are the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">26</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">those fellows?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is none of our business where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are," answered Lafe, now turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside Reno. "Our job is done. Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The'dore's lunging yell came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the cattle furiously:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Watch out--watch out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then the night burst with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunning reverberations of a chasm</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling in. A stuttering roar of gunfire</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed the calm of the hillside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the echoes bounded off the earth enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mously. Stripes of crimson painted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness a hundred jrards off to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastward, over in the direction the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiver had been. Dust rose around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno, dust kicked up by the thudding</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead. A McMurtree hand cried out as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart were breaking and the ponies</seg><seg type="columnLine">began pitching in a senseless, jammed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">up confusion. A form raced at Reno,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed his blackest rage, and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming to the ground. The herd</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke like water through a caving</seg><seg type="columnLine">dam, thundering off toward the valley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somewhere, farther away than before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">The'dore yelled again, the meaning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his words quite lost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reno crouched low in the leather,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching that long row of flame points</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow and die and glow. In that fraction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time he knew there was only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer--a quick retreat. He curbed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitching horse and pushed beside Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lafe, who seemed to have been strick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en to the spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Here--get out of this! Call your</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys out of it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But Big Lafe had no answer. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man was sitting stiff in the saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was facing the fire. Reno reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed over to catch the reins of the other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pony and missed. He had no second</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance for the McMurtree hands broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came racing on. The weight of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that flight carried Reno away from Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lafe. His horse was bumped dead on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to its knees, and got up again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of the McMurtree crew began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer the shots, aiming with un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking recklessness, and the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast of one of their guns stung Reno's</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Meanwhile the opposing fusillade</seg><seg type="columnLine">was veering, coming closer. Slugs</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck all around him. Another Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murtree rider fell, shouting up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the mad, churning hoofs. Reno</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hit again by a passing horse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, knowing he had lost all contact</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Big Lafe, he hauled his mount</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and fought through the press</seg><seg type="columnLine">of brute and man. He literally plowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trail into the clear, to find himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventually alone on the margin of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some stunted pines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The firing fell short of him. The Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murtree outfit had left the open. Soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">he detected a shift in the fighting.,The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds from the ambushers subsided</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerably and while he sat there in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saddle, detached and coolly consid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering, he made out a turning move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of those ambushers. They halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barrage of lead completely for as</seg><seg type="columnLine">long a space as it took to draw half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen deep breaths. Then suddenly--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for everything happened with whip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lash speed--a long and strung-out</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow undulated across the far edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the open area and vanished down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grade. At that the McMurlrees be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to halloo like hounds on the scent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They gathered in the brush, came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it and flung themselves by the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">movable Reno: and presently they too</seg><seg type="columnLine">were lost off there on the heels of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambushers.

Then, poised with all his senses</seg><seg type="columnLine">; probing the night, he was aware of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">. stir on the lower edge of the clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I Instinctively Reno bent forward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">i placed a hand over the nostrils of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">! pony, seeing a shadow drift up and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">■	halt. All he made out was a tall form</seg><seg type="columnLine">; on a horse, and even that was present-</seg><seg type="columnLine">s' ly blurred as the man circled the clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">' ing once and then went off at a drum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">| ming speed to the eastward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Reno gathered up the reins and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swung around the other way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I've got to go back to the ranch, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> decided grimty, and come to a show-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> down with those boys.

Then he'd arrange to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rustled stuff at fit occasions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">market it.

He had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one man he let into the secret, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was this foreman of his, Hale Wolfert.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolfert handles everything.

He rode rapidly, tense in</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectation of the unexpected. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he topped the heights, he deserted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail altogether and pushed downward</seg><seg type="columnLine">through heavy brush and sapling</seg><seg type="columnLine">stands. At sunup he turned a bend and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came upon a glade encircled by thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">virgin timber. As he did so all the force</seg><seg type="columnLine">of surprise drove his rein arm into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">checking gesture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ahead--only a hundred feet ahead--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hale Wolfert crouched over a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. The sound of Reno's approach was</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint, yet it stiffened the man instant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly.

Reno,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coldly realizing there was no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">course open, swayed in the saddle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a swift grab for his own weapon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As his fingers closed about it, he heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vindictive voice come from behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're covered.

That mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment became an hour and the silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">went flat and breathless.

Our little play last night worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right, didn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I blamed near didn't get out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">range before your men opened up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You might've waited another count, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten after I shouted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The boys was a little quick," ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted Wolfert. "I hadn't no more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped back from meetin' you and Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lafe before they started the shootin'.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The trouble was, your bunch started</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the clearin' quick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd been beyond hittin' in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">second. If you want my opinion, Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lafe acted cagey. It was the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in several months he came along with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the party."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEUDISTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">31</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I think," said The'dore slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that the bunch smelled something."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, it will turn out just like we</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted it to turn out. The McMurtrees</seg><seg type="columnLine">will figure they were led into a double</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross. They'll go hog-wild. They'll start</seg><seg type="columnLine">the war up again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," contradicted The'dore. "They'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">think some other rustlin' outfit timed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to cut in. They don't know who's be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the play. Big Lafe is the only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">that knows about Vilas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That's where you come in," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolfert. "When you go back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch you spill that. Say Vilas is in it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Say he arranged this affair. That'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">make 'em ready to come down off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yeah? How would I know this?</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'll ask me how I know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Easy," explained Wolfert. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell the McMurtrees you saw me and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple other of Vilas's hands rushin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the timber about daylight."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That puts you in no comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">position."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "L'll keep out of the way," answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolfert dryly. "I can afford to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chance in a game like this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But The'dore was finding flaws.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Vilas," he said, "will drop you when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he finds out you put on this show. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">means the end of his arrangement with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Lafe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Who's to tell him I put on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">show?" demanded Wolfert. "I'll ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain to him some other outfit cut in</seg><seg type="columnLine">on us. No, I'll do better. I'll tell him</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of your outfit double-crossed us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That will finish the Vilas-McMurtree</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreement right there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How about your own particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew of bunch-jumpers?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"They never did know Vilas was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this rustling. All they know is that I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">running an independent game. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">won't talk. They can't afford to. I spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot of time pickin' those jugheads.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There ain't a hand in the bunch that</seg><seg type="columnLine">dares pull out--he'd never get clear."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So you're fixed to go through with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're fixed to go through with it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">amended Wolfert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reno suffered a tremendous desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move his cramped arms. The sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned his skin and the dust bit at if,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throat stuck and he had to throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his will against the impulse to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cough. His gun had been taken--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">much he knew from the lack of weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his right hip. Yet occupied as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was by the physical torment, he fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed each man's talk with a puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention. It was clear enough that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in partnership for some design</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their own. What he could not arrive</seg><seg type="columnLine">at was the nature of the design.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The'dore was talking again with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reluctance that at once stamped him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weaker of the two.

They'll listen to me when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I say, 'Let's go wipe out the desert.' I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can do that. But I can't frame Big Lafe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and draw on him. You've got to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member all those boys have got a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Lafe's family blood in them. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't stand for it a minute."</seg><seg type="columnLine">32</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then," said Wolfert with a grunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of finality, "I'll take care of him."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leave that to me. But we're ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go on to the next stage of the game.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You go back to the ranch.

Rip</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to pieces and draw back home again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That shouldn't be so hard. Tomorrow's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tuesday and there'll be few punchers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in town. But the attack will put every</seg><seg type="columnLine">prairie rancher on the warpath. They'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">organize and bring a party up to at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack McMurtree. Then the ball is open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend--high, wide, and handsome.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And while all this is going on, there'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be damned few hands watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock on the range. I'll have my boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">comb it clean. Ain't that simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough? The McMurtrees will get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame for doing it. You and I will clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a young fortune."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "While the scrap lasts," grumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">The'dore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will last a long time. The last</seg><seg type="columnLine">war went on for two years. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Vilas made his money.

He wondered at his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">failure in not understanding it before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During a range war all bars were</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. Anything could happen, as Hale</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolfert meant should happen now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But again The'dore was arguing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm to lead these fellows into Black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've got to take a chance once in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a while," pointed out Wolfert impa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiently. "What ails you? All you do is</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the McMurtrees scrapping and</seg><seg type="columnLine">running. I do the rest. You get your</seg><seg type="columnLine">profits out of me. That ain't the whole</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">story, either. When this thing is finish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, we may have the prairie outfits</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to make a dicker for peace. Thir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty men, you want to realize, can run a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole county ragged. Well, if it works</seg><seg type="columnLine">out that way you'll be the king pin in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hills. Big Lafe will be dead or he'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no more authority over his men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Point is, keep the lads whipped up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They're a hard bunch and they like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've done enough palaverin'."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's settled then. Tomorrow night</seg><seg type="columnLine">you ride."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yeah," agreed The'dore with no</seg><seg type="columnLine">great enthusiasm. "But we've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do something about Reno."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Reno went cold. He heard the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach, boots scuffing the soft dirt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of them walked around. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in back. Through the narrow slit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his eyelids he saw a pair of legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">within reach of his arms, and he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">then what he would do. It was a thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance, but all that he had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get it over with," said The'dore</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervously. "Me, I don't care for .cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">turkey."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a long pause. Wolfert, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind, wasn't moving and there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of an arm reaching for a gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno's nerves were like threads of ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he set his mind for the outward</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunge that was to bring The'dore down</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the heels. Then he heard Wolfert</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying reflectively:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No-o, I got a better idea. I'll take</seg><seg type="columnLine">him along. He may be a help to me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno, relaxing, was not prepared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">what followed. Wolfert let out a grunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and struck with his boot, catching</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno in the small of the back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You!" snapped Wolfert. "Come out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reno's head rolled and he dug the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nails of his fingers deep into his palms</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEUDISTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">33</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to hold himself from springing up. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> opened his eyes, staring directly into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wolfert's lowered face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Get up," said Vilas's foreman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Reno pulled himself to his knees,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> staggered to his feet. A gray blur</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> passed across the day and he thought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> he was falling. Wolfert seized him and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> shook him about with a vindictive</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> pleasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Come out of it--you're lucky to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> here! I've had two chances at you and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> didn't take 'em. If you ever get out of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> this, Reno, you'll maybe learn a little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> something about deliverin' messages."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The'dore swung around and walked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> off to his horse. "Too much talk, Wol-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fert," he said over his shoulder, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> then climbed to the saddle. A moment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> later he vanished around the bend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get aboard," said Vilas's foreman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," murmured Reno ten-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tatively, "what this is all about, but--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wolfert's broad and challenging face</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hardened. He rapped out swiftly, "Oh,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•	yes you do! You know damned well</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> what it's about."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Reno let the talk drop. A sweeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">\ reaction took hold of him and the ache</seg><seg type="columnLine">i in his head ran through his muscles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving him faint and dispirited. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a real effort to get into the saddle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel around. At Wolfert's gesture, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the glade, passed between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great pines and presently hit a shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">j owed trail that looped downward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">i Thus by degrees they descended from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hill country proper and entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more open folds of the bench. Going</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a meadow marked by sagging rail</seg><seg type="columnLine">fences, they entered a thicket of wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows, forded a shallow creek sparkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sunlight, and then pushed into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wider and more gentle clearing stud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ded by the gray, unpainted Benton</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses. There seemed to be no life</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">about these, but when they drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">abreast of the porch of the main house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thin-figured little man appeared and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood attentively by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put him in the back bedroom," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolfert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reno walked through the doorway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not pause in the shattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">front room, but instead went on along</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hall to its end and turned to the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">and through another doorway. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he swung around he found the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">man studying him with a roused curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Seem to know your way about,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the fellow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reno only shrugged his shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet he realized he had made a mistake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The little man opened his mouth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak, changed his mind, and closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. Reno stood a long while in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the room, hearing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other walk back to the front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. Meanwhile, his eyes traveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from wall to wall, from the scarred</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor to the water-stained ceiling, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his features darkened and grew more</seg><seg type="columnLine">embittered. Here, in bygone years, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lived and slept- and played as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">child. This ruin now staring him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face hit him hard; it was the last out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage, the final bit of desolation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrilege. There was a shapeless bunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one corner and a rat-eaten mattress</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it. He lay on it full length, face</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fell asleep, never realizing how</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly the wear and tear of the recent</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours had drained his vitality. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he awoke it was with a quick tensing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of muscles, with a sudden shock. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was full of shadows and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the sound of many men talking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front part of the house. Turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">half over, he saw the little man</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched beside the bed, a queer, cat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">34</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">like look of absorption on the thin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil cheeks. At Reno's abrupt rise, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little man swung alertly back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Brother," said he admiringly, "you</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure let the cares of the world go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hell. I couldv'e shot a cannon over you</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbeknownst. Feel some better?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reno was astonished at the change</seg><seg type="columnLine">in himself. He had come to this room</seg><seg type="columnLine">miserable in mind and body. Standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">erect now, he felt the old freshness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit course through him like fire. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sharp-witted again, full of hope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of himself. But all he said to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little man was: "What time is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Toward evenin'," said the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. "Not that it should make any dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference to you. You're wanted out</seg><seg type="columnLine">front."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reno went through the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the hall. The little man followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a covert warning. "Mind 3rour</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk. Wolfert's on the prod." Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno came into the front room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused to find himself bracketed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eyes of eight or ten of the hardest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">most lawless faces he had ever seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fire burned in a sheet-iron stove</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a lantern on a center table threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">out an uneven light, only half touch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing those figures posted around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls. The talk ceased instantly. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">treacherous silence rushed across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Reno, reaching for his tobacco,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw them stiffen, saw their cheeks take</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a smooth expressionless mask. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as if he had challenged them by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his appearance. Certainly they were on</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard. Running his own glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">around, Reno saw Wolfert in a remote</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner. Wolfert, finding himself spot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted, suddenly broke the spell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well--anybody ever see this man</seg><seg type="columnLine">before?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silence came again, increasingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighted with sullen antagonism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno, feeling the weight of it, lit a</seg><seg type="columnLine">match to his cigarette.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Skinny--you ever see him before?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little man who had acted as mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senger came from behind Reno, slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking his head. "No, Hale. I ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Another hand broke in. "If he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody we had ought to know, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">is he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Wolfert walked to the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nobody," he rapped out.

And if</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's any smell of trouble up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, don't go after it.

He swung up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell in beside Wolfert,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and matched the oth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er's easy canter across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clearing. Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">another belt of trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came to the crest of the bench</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw all the vast prairie below fad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing beneath the dark.

Something long ago forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved out of memory's grave and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive again. He swore under his breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his failure to grasp it, laid the tip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rowels across the pony's flanks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shot on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The compact with Wolfert stung his</seg><seg type="columnLine">36</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pride. Even though it had been made</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the point of force, it belittled him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself and made the future even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more complicated. The whole affair</seg><seg type="columnLine">was increasingly tangled with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soiled threads of deceit and greed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil. He stood at a point from which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might survey the uneasy relations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all these men in the worst light. Wol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fert, the strongest and the most brazen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirrored the rest in his ruthless and</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemptuous attitude of dog-eat-dog.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno had no illusions concerning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.

Wolfert circled about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the town and advanced on its southern</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. Dismounting in the gloom of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned shed, he waited for Reno to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come along. Of a sudden his voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic and domineering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By God, Reno, you go through with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll carry the interview through,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Reno indifferently. "After that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolfert, I'll be looking out for myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wolfert let out a gusty breath and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "All right.

Wolfert's</seg><seg type="columnLine">knuckles tapped gently on a wall; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">door opened on a rectangular yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow. Pete Vilas's tall frame strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the light and vanished. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolfert went in and Reno followed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">closing the door behind. This was again</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room behind the saloon bar; Vilas</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in a corner of it, his Yankee face</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrewdly, non-committally set.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hal$, where did you get Reno?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Found him scoutin' the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">this morning," Wolfert said cautiously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"so I took him to camp."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told you the other night I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust him.

"Sit and take it?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or go clean that country out?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Leave that to me," said Vilas.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What was your idea about Reno?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"To keep him where I'd have my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes on him," grumbled Wolfert. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't trust him.

"Wolfert, go out front</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bring George here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wolfert went to the inner door. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEUDISTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">37</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was opening it when something oc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">curred to him.

Almost instantly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Vilas turned on his heel and walked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the little table in the room. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pulled out a drawer, took a forty-five</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from within, and shoved it across the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">table's top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That's yours, Reno."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno reached for it, puzzled. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand snapped back and his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardened against that gun, the butt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">; which held a star and crescent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearl.

Deliberately he pulled away</seg><seg type="columnLine">X from the thought, knowing that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no difference. The possession of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gun answered all arguments. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers closed about the butt. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped open the cylinder, satisfied</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself as to the loads, and shook the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder into its seat. Vilas's face had</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed again and now carried a look</seg><seg type="columnLine">\ of bitter purpose about it. All the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face show of good humor had gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">! Reno dropped the gun to his holster.</seg><seg type="columnLine">'What for?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You know what Wolfert would've</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">done to you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, here's your answer.

All</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old fences he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">built up around Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton, all the safeguards and screens</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which he had hidden that man</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something inside him brimmed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">during that fractional minute of be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trayal. The even balance of his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">tipped, and the last dissenting scruple</seg><seg type="columnLine">at bloodshed died there in the hushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspense that began to grow intoler-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. He had sworn to himself that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never resume his true identity</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he had found the killer of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">father; and here and now that purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">was apparently fulfilled. No reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">was left for carrying on the false</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">name, and he saw that even if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to continue as Reno, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not.

A moment ago the issue had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been clear-cut and his own decision</seg><seg type="columnLine">made; now he was not so sure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vilas's guilt. Vilas shifted on his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carefully raised a hand to wipe a</seg><seg type="columnLine">damp forehead.

Wolfert started to curse; his el-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows crawled higher and the fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his right hand began to spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart. But Benton was watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's eyes and he saw something in</seg><seg type="columnLine">them that defined the next step for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.

He had no hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the color of excitement stained his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck a turkey red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Vilas--hey, Vilas, it's the McMur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees!

Without</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to finish his warning, the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man threw himself violently about and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced away. Wolfert's head rose from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its fixed position and Benton saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow's eyes mirror astonishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why," said Wolfert, "I told The-</seg><seg type="columnLine">'dore tomorrow night--not tonight!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vilas looked at the foreman, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked. Then his turning arm came</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the table lamp and swept it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor. It happened so rapidly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton's reactions were delayed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">light went out, or seemed to. At any</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate the room turned dark, relieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">only by the glow coming in from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vilas yelled, "You everlastin' fool!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sprang through that door at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same moment Benton dropped to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">fours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two things happened at once.

As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell, Benton dragged the table with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for shelter, but this fresh light in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room laid him wide open and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no choice of chances. Wolfert's bullets</seg><seg type="columnLine">went high, screaming through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flimsy walls beyond; and then the gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral crash and batter of the McMurtree</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack drowned out all else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Righting himself, Benton came up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from behind the table with his own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weapon blasting a cover for him. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he had no need of it. Wolfert was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He had retreated into the barroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Benton made no more mistakes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Reaching behind, he opened the rear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">door and stepped into the dark, turning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the next instant to hurdle all the junk</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">piles on the back side of the town. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">got to the horses, took his own by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bridle, and led it away, paralleling the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">buildings. A hundred yards to the east</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the saloon, he left the pony with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">; reins grounded and went up an alley</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at full run. At the street he halted and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crouched in the shadows, a spectator</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">watching the storm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no doubt of the fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage of the McMurtrees. Their first at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack had carried them all through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">I street and out the far end; they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">:&lt; back now at a rush, massed two and</seg><seg type="columnLine">two, firing to either side. Window' glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">i fell on porch top and sidewalk like</seg><seg type="columnLine">jangling rain; the whine of lead rip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">j. ping across the soft walls rose higher.</seg><seg type="columnLine">| From his covert, Benton saw light aft-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	er light go out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">j The McMurtrees were shouting from</seg><seg type="columnLine">; point to point, emptying the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They abandoned their compact ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">j rangement--Benton guessed they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling the tide go with them--and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to cut through the alleys in pairs,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to ride into the stores. The taint of</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned powder drifted along the dark;</seg><seg type="columnLine">muzzle flashes made weird glows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once he thought he saw The'dore in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mad tangle, but a second glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed just another McMurtree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile, Blackrock began to ral-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly; the opposition strengthened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to collect at the saloon. A Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murtree fell out of the saddle in pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that point; another hill man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse dropped from beneath him. See-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that, the McMurtrees began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw back into the deeper darkness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton thought they had enough and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were retreating.	f</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The same thought moved a few of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Blackrock citizens into the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. But it was a mistake. The Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murtrees hurled themselves into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">semi-light once more, the head of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">column going like the point of a spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the saloon. The volleys blazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crackled and then there was a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounding smash of horseflesh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood as the McMurtrees struck the sa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loon at window and door and literally</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke through. Benton, absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck to his tracks, shook an aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished head. He had never seen men</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle like this before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Must be years of heartburn behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">that," he muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw now, casting a glance farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the shadows, a lank figure rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">from an alley and begin to throw bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets into that struggling mass by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon. Presently this man walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">boldly into the street, refilling his gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he crossed a beam of light he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">identified: Pete Vilas, coolly taking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scrap. Vilas snapped his cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut and raised his gun with an amaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing coldness of nerve. Benton did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear the shot, drowned as it was by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torrent of sound all about him, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">42</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">did see the gun kick back in the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's fist, and he also saw the nut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped head nod as if in approval.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vilas tried again, stepped back a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">paces, seemed to see some better</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance, and pivoted to lay his sights</seg><seg type="columnLine">down an alley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But he never dropped the hammer</seg><seg type="columnLine">on another cartridge; a gun cracked</seg><seg type="columnLine">near at hand at Benton's right and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vilas, raising his face to the star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flecked sky above him, fell limply</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a gesture. Benton recoiled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced quickly along his side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street. He saw Hale Wolfert rise from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knees from beside the stable water</seg><seg type="columnLine">trough and cut over the dust. The next</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he was out of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That warned Benton as no other in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cident could have^done.

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing left here for him to do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The next move was back to the hills,</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the McMurtree house before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crew got there. He retreated to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear of the alley, got to his horse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed into the saddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Five minutes later he was a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from Blackrock, aiming for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bench. From that position he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see a long fan-shaped flare of yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">light sweep skyward. Blackrock was</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that is the end of Big Lafe's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope of peace," Benton said to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self.

Scowling at the long, black out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of the hills before him, he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded: "I've about come to the end of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the drifting stage.

Looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily at the mark of ruin there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton saw what he had been partic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ularly seeking. The McMurtree outfit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling at no great speed, came along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lane of light made by the fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound back for the hills. There was, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly as he could make out, no party</seg><seg type="columnLine">of townsmen following.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a half hour in the lead and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">continuing the climb, he set a pace in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended to increase that advantage.

Drawing abreast of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch, he saw the girl framed there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face darkly shadowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who is il?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me," said Benton, and got down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A quick expulsion of breath an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEUDISTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">swered him.

But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">disregarded the question. It was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the McMurtree hands who spoke up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How's that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Attack was to've been tomorrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">night," explained Benton negligently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who told you?" pressed the hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton ventured a brief side glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">at them and saw he had the complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention of the crew. He drew a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath, pinning his eyes to The'dore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've been badly fooled, boys. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't blame you for wiping Blackrock</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the map. But it ain't your idea, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">you think. A cleverer head figured it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out--a fellow that wanted a roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">good war started for his own profit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While the prairie is chasing you fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows all over hell's half acre, he'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">out stripping the range--and you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the blame."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The'dore relaxed. The'dore permit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted himself a flicker of a smile that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wry and dangerous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Seem to have the confidence of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow, Reno."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was sort of forced on me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here," said the McMurtree hand;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"let's get somewheres.

Wasn't my fight. Next day I started</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the slope and ran into a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentlemen seriously talkin' shop. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid cold. But I heard these two talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty. They arranged the attack for</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow night. One of those fellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Wolfert--and he took me to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp. I finally broke away and got</seg><seg type="columnLine">back here to meet the other man. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">crook right there--The'dore."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The'dore's grin of cold fury grew. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought you'd mess up some such</seg><seg type="columnLine">story," he sneered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Benton pressed on, driving his point</seg><seg type="columnLine">home. "That cattle fight was staged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolfert meant it as a starter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah?" growled The'dore. "You--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The'dore was in on that also,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped Benton. "For proof of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where was The'dore when the shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">began? On the dead lope, away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meadows. That first bust of lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">found him away to the other side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the battle. You bet he knew. He never</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed up till daylight the next morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you?" asked the McMur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree hand, with a clear show of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfulness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jim Benton, son of old Hi."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh," muttered the hand. "I begin--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sure. Mj^ own iron's in the fire. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've found the man that killed my old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. It's no McMurtrec and so I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got no grudge against you. But you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing the part of suckers. You went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to Blackrock and you lost a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Where was The'dore during that</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">scrap? I didn't see him in the lead--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was in an alley watching pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">close. Suckers--it's the plain fact."</seg><seg type="columnLine">That stung them, and Benton saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had made a mistake. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been too harsh. The McMurtree hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned slowly to The'dore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Guess it's up to you to answer this</seg><seg type="columnLine">dude, The'dore."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can do it," rasped The'dore. "Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, just drop that gun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd as soon see you draw," said Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton evenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The'dore's eyebrows came farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. He half drew a breath, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold it. Then he called sharply to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Spread across the room. If he lifts</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gun--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Benton, not daring to let The'dore</seg><seg type="columnLine">get beyond the focus of his vision,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the crew break reluctantly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the compact huddle and obey the or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. The'dore had won.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," repeated The'dore, "just drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun and walk out of the door."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something happened then that Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton didn't quite grasp at first. The girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">had apparently left the room a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. She came running from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen now and her command was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a dash of cold water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No! Get out of here--all of you!</seg><seg type="columnLine">March, you fools! The'dore, do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want a load of buckshot?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It broke the tension and turned all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them in her direction. She stood be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the fireplace, a double-barreled</seg><seg type="columnLine">shotgun lifted on her own people. The-</seg><seg type="columnLine">'dore swayed forward, but Big Lafe's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm pushed him roughly back. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody cursed violently and wheel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed around. In another moment they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were filing out to the porch. Stepping</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward to the wall, Benton trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun on The'dore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You, too," he said softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The'dore flung up his head. "You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">never leave this house," he muttered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Rae, I'll have something to say to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">later--when this is ironed out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The'dore went over the boards, heels</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragging, and left the place. Benton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for that, kicked the door shut,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot the bolt, and sprang aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Blow the light," he called. "Get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the fireplace." Outside he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear The'dore's harsh voice de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nouncing him, goading the men, urg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them to attacking positions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the girl who whipped out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp's glow. Big Lafe stood motion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, muttering:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're no better off. We're worse</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. Should have taken their guns."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We didn't have enough bulge on</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em to work it," said Benton. "It's one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing at a time. This was the best we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do--this time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Part of the crew ran the length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the porch, heels making a clatter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl said sharply, "Dad, get away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that fire!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hide in my own house?" thundered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Lafe. "Never! I--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rest of his speech was over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelmed by the roar of a gun. Glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">clattered to the floor. A high yelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to rise from outside. Big Lafe</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly turned, put a hand to his chest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bowed his head, the firelight show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the grim despair riding his fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">old face. Then he went down as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting the collapse with every stub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">born fiber in him--went down on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and lay there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl screamed, "Dad!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's worse for you two," mumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Lafe. "For me it's better. The re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards of a crooked life. I'm glad to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">thisaway. There, honey, stop the cry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.

Stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">crying--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Posted in the darkest part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, Benton saw the old man die.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rae McMurtree crouched over him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbing with a stifled agony that cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Benton like a knife. Beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house wall men were running again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a call went from place to place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then a voice penetrated the boards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Get upstairs, Rae. We're goin' to</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast Benton to hell an' gone!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        Chapter Eleven</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        Into the Shadows</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I HE fire on the hearth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dying, turning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dull blood glow;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rae McMurtree still</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched on her knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Big Lafe, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had stopped cry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and he saw her</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders rigid1 y framed against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwindling light, her head raised and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes fixed on some point above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mantel. Looking up there, Benton saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the framed picture of a woman, a wist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful middle-aged woman who seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">survey the room with a profound sad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and wisdom. Benton guessed it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the girl's mother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The voice called again, more peremp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torily: "Rae, get upstairs! Get out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room and stay away from Benton! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Come away," said Benton gently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The girl got to her feet and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to him very slowly. He was sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised to find how contained her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, as if she had exerted her will to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put the tragedy behind her. It struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that suddenly she looked a great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">deal like that older woman whose pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture was on the mantel piece--sad, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolute and unafraid. Benton express-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the only reassurance he could find.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He was a tired man, your dad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mighty tired. And he said he was glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go this way. I'd take his word for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, Rae."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe it," whispered the girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then she raised her dark glance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "The McMurtree women have al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways gone through this, Jim. Always</seg><seg type="columnLine">have cried over men who died in vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence. Disappointment and heartbreak</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a life of uncertainty in one wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">land or another. Before my mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">died she told me to expect it--to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">to smile when there was nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile for. There is a strain of lawless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness in the McMurtree blood that noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing will cure. Nothing but a bullet. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">this--I knew it would come some day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I never thought a McMurtree</seg><seg type="columnLine">would ever die at the hands of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind. Jim, I've been a good soldier till</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, never saying much because I un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood how much my father wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace to come. But I can feel sorry no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer for what happens to the boys.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm all through with that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Any brothers of yours out there?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No. The closest kin I have in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard is a second cousin. The rest are</seg><seg type="columnLine">even less related. The'dore--he is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">relation at all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wanted to know," said Benton</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravely. "I've got to fight back. It'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be your own people I'm throwing lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">at."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go ahead!" said the girl with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick surge of energy. "There is noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing more I can do. They are out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy and be destroyed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's me or them," Benton added,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanting to make the point very clear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She lifted her eyes so that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">50</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">see them. "You ought to know by now</seg><seg type="columnLine">how I feel about that, Jim."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The brusque voice came again:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We're opening up at the count of ten.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Are you in the clear, Rae?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go upstairs," whispered Benton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll follow in a minute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be careful," said Rae McMurtree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and held her position. But Benton</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned her about with his hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed her away. Waiting there in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackest corner of the hall, he saw her</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb the stairs and pause at the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. At that, Benton moved. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat-footed along the wall, came beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">a window and crouched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somebody outside said, "All set?" A</seg><seg type="columnLine">man farther off repeated it. A moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later a body leaped to the porch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced across it. The man at the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung his cry high into the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the signal for a rising roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns, a rending sound of wood and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinkling of shattered glass all around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room. Lead ripped the floor at Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's feet. Lead whined and flattened</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the stones of the fireplace, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the embers of the fire leaped up as one</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet and' another tore into it. Benton</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffened, catching the silhouette of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">McMurtree hand wavering outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. He lifted his revolver, waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">with patience till he saw his target fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sure, and then he fired. That man</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down, without uttering a word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But beyond, a thick, savage shout</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke through the detonations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go after him--go after him! Smash</seg><seg type="columnLine">that door down before he kills anybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">else! What's the matter with you yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low mugs?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was The'dore, speaking from</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter. Benton wheeled and ducked</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from his location. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">spotted by some hand shooting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">through another window and the slugs I</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that marksman rapped the flooring</seg><seg type="columnLine">right at his heels. Once more flattened</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall, Benton studied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows until he caught the muzzle</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash coming through one near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front door. He flred only once, pivoted</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and raced up the stairs to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallery. They were sledging in the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a heavy piece of timber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jim," whispered the girl. "We'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">better try to get away. The storeroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof leads off from my bedroom win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No horses--no chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your horse is in the shed beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storeroom."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The end of the timber crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the panels of the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed there. Benton took a hand rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the gallery railing and put the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">three shells of his load into those</seg><seg type="columnLine">panels with a cold fury. Savagely</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased, he heard them yelling on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch. The end of the timber skewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward as the outside part was drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped and deserted. A moment later a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresher and more intsnse volley tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">through all the windows. The girl laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand on Benton's shoulder while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reloaded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'd better try it." she urged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's no use trying to hold out</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. They'll get in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're in," grunted Benton and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned far over the rail to corrtmand</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kitchen doorway. Three men came</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it at once, bodies dim in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness of the room. They literally</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled themselves through, jammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">together and firing as they entered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Afterward they broke, each man ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vancing on a different tangent, sweep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the shadows for the target as yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">undiscovered. Motionless for one brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">second, Benton watched, at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEUDISTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">time hearing the front door grind on</seg><seg type="columnLine">its hinges again. One arm moved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl backward, out of range, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other brought up the gun with a drag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging deliberation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Benton said, "Up here, boys," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">let go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The foremost hand, almost at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot of the stairway, emitted a great,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gusty cry and snapped his weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. But Benton pinned him in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks, the roar of the concerted explo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions washing like waves of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him. He caught the second man</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the middle of the room--saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">spin and fall--and with that maddened</seg><seg type="columnLine">coolness still touching every nerve and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiber, he tried for the third hand duck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing back beneath the gallery by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fireplace. This marksman shot away a</seg><seg type="columnLine">section of stairway banister, knocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a loosely nailed board of the gallery</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself not a foot from where Benton</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood. And then, cursing at each ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer fall, he hooked himself around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kitchen doorway's edge and got be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond range.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The front!" cried the girl. "Watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But Benton had seen the door go</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from the corner of his vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now, free to divert his attention,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did all that he could do. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">again three cartridges left and a door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way full of charging McMurtrees. Into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that boiling jam of bodies he placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last of his shots, wheeled, and ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a bedroom. The girl, preceding him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the door quietly and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">speechless in the deeper dark, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath rising and falling. The boom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, excited cries of the ranch crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">overflowed the main hall and beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the bedroom wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That window leads to the storeroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof," said the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Benton closed the revolver's cylinder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on another load, remarking: "It's gone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this far, so it might as well go a little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">farther."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The girl crossed the room, pulling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aside the curtains. "The window is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">open. Your luck won't last forever."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No," murmured Benton. "It never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">has."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Then come on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He was listening to the noise out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there in the hall. It sounded like an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ax knocking away on the stairs. Furni-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ture tipped and was dragged across the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">floor. One man's voice seemed to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ordering all this in rapid, nervous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">phrases.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It's better for you to be left be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hind," urged Benton, "than to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">struck by a bullet meant for me. Cross-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing the roof is dangerous business,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Rae."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She was not beside him. Turning, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saw her slip through the window. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">soft whisper came back:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Whether you want it or not, you've</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">got me on your shoulders. Come on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He followed, dropping down two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feet to the peak of the storeroom roof</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and flattening himself beside the girl,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">who was lying on the shingles. A soli-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tary figure ran clumsily out of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">barn, passed beneath them and around</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the front of the house. Elsewhere,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Benton could make out no McMurtree</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">standing guard. He let go of the roof's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ridge and worked down to the eaves,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and a moment later dropped to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ground. Reaching up, he seized the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">girl as she came to the eaves and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">steadied her. She was whispering</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Follow me and I'll run for the shed</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the horse is.

A man began crying for the Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murtrees at the top of his voice. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashing echoes in the house stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly and Benton made out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounding of feet across the living-room</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. Hard on that, the surrounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness was pierced by the stinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">whine of rifle bullets and off at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower edge of the long meadow sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed flat reports strung together, like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion of firecrackers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Try it!" snapped Benton.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lost the girl in that space of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">it took him to turn around.

She was there wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and catching his arm, she led him</seg><seg type="columnLine">around to a doorway and through it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His horse moved up, swung against</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Out of this door and straight for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward," said Rae swiftly. "The trees are</seg><seg type="columnLine">only about two hundred feet off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Down--flat down!" grunted Benton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he fell, pulling her with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was trouble nearer at hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rifles were rolling out a louder</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury along the meadow and from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediate area beyond the shed--</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the girl had Indicated their safe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty to lie--a great clatter and smashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of brush announced a flanking attack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He heard men break clear and come on</seg><seg type="columnLine">afoot, calling in undertones to each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, and presently he made out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifting line of about six men breast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the dark. Benton crawled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and laid his gun across it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Roll aside and keep your head low,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he muttered to Rae.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He thought the attacking hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant to collect by the shed. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">raced on with every indication of do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it, which meant disaster for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for the girl. Benton lifted his gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">to throw them back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before his hammer fell a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement started. The main body out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of the house seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted by the resistance of the McMur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees in the house. A heavy call pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated the shadows, a call of warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">and direction, and in response the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen men swinging up to the shed</seg><seg type="columnLine">veered sharply and went by it, aiming</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the barn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Benton thought that the foreground</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clear and had started to rise when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pair of men came dimly into view,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossing the ground at a slower pace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They disregarded the general fight. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact they appeared to be avoiding it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Benton had barely time enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll aside from the shed's doorway</seg><seg type="columnLine">when these two reached it and stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damn-fool stunt--to hit the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the house," said one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wolfert's full of fool stunts," grunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You in any hurry to run against</seg><seg type="columnLine">that shootin'?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do I look like it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"We-ell, this is a good place to be."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yeah, if Wolfert don't catch us."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's plumb busy over yonder."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't lay no bets on it.

Benton shifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun and held his breath. Such faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">light as came through the door opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">was blocked out as one of the two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentatively stepped in and halted. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, straining moment of suspense en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sued. The pony blubbered a little and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted forward; one of his feet grazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton and that seemed to frighten</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, for he fiddled backward with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEUDISTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">53</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">excited blast through his nostrils. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man remaining outside issued a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''I wouldn't be foolin' around, Jeff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Somebody," said the fellow inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shed, "put this critter here for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick run." He took another step for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, changed his mind, and wheeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. Benton saw him cross the dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">shield of the doorway and move be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe this ain't no place for us,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the first voice. "Too many stray</seg><seg type="columnLine">slugs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"All right. We'll amble toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bam."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They went away at a trot and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps finally faded into the general up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of the fight in the meadow. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reached pitched proportions. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guns were ripping the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">into shreds. A man in the meadow was</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelling with a crazy ferocity, but noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing he said made sense. Yet it served</seg><seg type="columnLine">a purpose; it never varied, never</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved nearer or went farther away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from it Benton judged the attack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers were no closer to the house than</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been. The McMurtree fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">held them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Appears to be a break here for us,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered Benton. "We'll try it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She was up and beside him instant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. "Ride out on the dead run, Jim?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, that won't do. You get on your</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and knees and crawl across to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tree line. I'll wait about half a min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute and then follow with the pony."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He saw her drop and move away, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he lost her. Time lagged intoler-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably and he caught himself methodical-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly counting. There was a distinct break</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fight that worried him--a shift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of forces. Some of Wolfert's men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were coming along the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meadow apparently with the idea of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hitting the house on an angle. The Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murtrees caught that maneuver in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly and began to fire through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side window's. The gun reports shifted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashing out more distinctly, and Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton heard the w'hipping of the spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead along the ground and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush. Meanwhile his mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">counting reached thirty and stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seizing the pony's cheek strap, he led</seg><seg type="columnLine">it through the doorway, paused for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">final check, and struck straight across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cleared area.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly two great bombs of fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot into the sky from the meadow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The McMurtrees had managed to build</seg><seg type="columnLine">their brush piles in that brief period</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the death of Big Lafe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolfert's attack, and now they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been ignited. The furious spires of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light at once caught part of Wolfert's</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in a deadly silhouette. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light did more than that. It reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the side of tfie house, dispelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the farther shadows, and revealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton halfway between the shed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Someone cried out, "Catch that</seg><seg type="columnLine">man!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bullet flicked the dirt at his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he saw two men race for him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">tandem order. There was only one an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer. He went up the wrong side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horse to the saddle and dug in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurs. Bent far down, he crossed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of the open stretch in great lunges</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drove heedlessly into the marginal</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush. A volley of shots followed him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The horse abruptly w'inced, staggered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as Benton threwr himself clear, fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Benton sprang aside from the bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let-swept space, shouting, "Rae--Rae!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he brought up short, feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl's arm reach out and touch him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For answer he picked her up bodily</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran on into the depths of the tim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber, a good fifty feet on, down the lip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a gully and into the mushy under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">footing of a forest creek. Safe here, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped and let the girl stand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've lost a horse," he muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> \ "There's a bunch of ponies back by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the yard," said Rae, "left</seg><seg type="columnLine">there by those men that came toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait here," said Benton and climb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed from the gully. The fires in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meadow were burning brightly and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the horses bracketed against this</seg><seg type="columnLine">light only a little to the left of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Closing in, he got out his pocket knife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut the cinches of all but two, and led</seg><seg type="columnLine">these back. He missed the girl again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had to send out a short halloo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he found her she said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is a warning for us, Jim. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must not get separated in these hills."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What I want to do," reflected Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, "is get back Jo the high country</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we were riding the other day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You know the trails.

But it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was a tricky trail she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">followed and he lost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her twice before they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">made the long curve</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about the McMurtree meadow and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">paused on the edge of a southern can-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">yon. She stopped and turned the horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, lifting an arm to what was go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on over by the ranch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Jim--I'll never go back there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Never! The ground is saturated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood. I have nothing left--not one sin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gle kinsman worth saving or remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bering. It's the end of the McMurtree</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had no reply. There was none to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make. Those great glares were like fu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neral pyres. The house loomed up like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fortress and the lesser buildings to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear were squat and dull crimson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men were rushing out of one covert</seg><seg type="columnLine">into another and long lances of orange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple creased the shadows about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barn. In that brief and final inspection</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw one irregular wave of Wolfert</seg><seg type="columnLine">men pour from the barn and stumble</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, converging on the back quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of the main house. Some of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped; the rest went on and van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished from view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The yelling had increased, pitching</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the meadow with a strangled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">muted effect. On the porch he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">climax of one bitter contest; a Wolfert</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand leaped from the darker side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house to the porch and raced across</seg><seg type="columnLine">it just as some McMurtree hand opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door and came out. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">parrying. Those two plunged together</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a snarling, wrenching body-to-body</seg><seg type="columnLine">conflict, and the McMurtree man at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught his opponent under the arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forced him back into the house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somebody raced for the trees, never</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking behind him. A Wolfert partisan</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped out of the barn with a lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch in his fist, got against the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall without injury, and dropped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch against the wood. After that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">scuttled the length of the wall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed to the rear. Rae McMurtree</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew a quick, hurt breath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEUDISTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Let's get out of here!

They rose to the summits and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">passed beneath the rolling banks of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fog. The far-ofT firing dimmed and died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But once, turning to scan the blank-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ness of sky and earth, he saw a widen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing arc of crimson stain the distant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">obscurity. The ranch was burning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">That grim old fortress of the hills was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">being consumed as Blackrock had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">&gt;	consumed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They were scraping the ceiling of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the world, and eastward the opaque</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quality of the night began to break.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Another day stood on the threshold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Seeing that, Benton called a halt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They were in a small, pine-surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed glade that literally dripped with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">condensing mists.

The sky was still full of stars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the grayness of early morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled it, lightened it and slowly shifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a paling blue. Eastward a rose light</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to lift. False rain dropped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree and bush. The two horses were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet off, cropping the lush</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass. The smell of smoke drifted on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slight wind--the smoke of the Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murtree ranch buildings. The girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Benton back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We might as well have it out," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Benton turned, finding a brighter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">glow in the girl's eyes.

When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked around she was smiling. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">small hand rose swiftly to her mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went out to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gamblers sometimes win, Jim!" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">called.

So</seg><seg type="columnLine">pronounced was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling that he paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stood with his attention weighing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the minor sounds arising out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning's primeval calm. Reassured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went on, found a more or less clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">grade, and mounted the rough pin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nacle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At its tip the panoramic view of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills unrolled to all sides. By now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mists had condensed in the lower can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yons and coursed along them like</seg><seg type="columnLine">foaming tides of water. Each jagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rounded surface of the country lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposed, running northward to a still</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater tangle of ravine and ridge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sloping out southward to the prairie.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That way Benton made a long survey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking the outline of Blackrock and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding only a dim char mark on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. Of the McMurtree ranch he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could locate no fragment, but he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">see a column of smoke bellying up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from behind a flat-topped butte. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">passions of men these last few hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">had consumed much. He realized how</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeless it was now to expect a lessen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the chase or a softening of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unleashed antagonisms. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more to be consumed. Fire never died</seg><seg type="columnLine">till it had eaten away the substance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its own heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Benton's habit to analyze his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunes pessimistically during idle</seg><seg type="columnLine">spells. Now he considered the account</seg><seg type="columnLine">to date and found it dismal enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From first entry into the country he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had been pretty much thrown about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At no time had there been a break or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing spell in which he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">choose his own plan. Events had rush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed him along until now he faced a</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-way attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The McMurtrees were against him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolfert and Wolfert's band would</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunt for him. And lastly there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that new force in the battle to account</seg><seg type="columnLine">for--the prairie men. They would as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">semble on the ruins of Blackrock and</seg><seg type="columnLine">march forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Each bunch set against the other,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton told himself, "and all of 'em,</seg><seg type="columnLine">set against me. I don't know which</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to look first. Wolfert may still be</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged with the McMurtrees. Or one</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the other party may have run off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The one mighty certain fact is that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prairie bunch will be coming this way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'll tangle with the McMurtrees</seg><seg type="columnLine">without comment. Probably they'll do</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same with the Wolfert outfit if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch up. Wolfert himself might talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way into the prairie delegation, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could never convince the prairie</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys that his bunch of rustlers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the right side. So it stands--all</seg><seg type="columnLine">'messed up. Only other clear item is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Wolfert will try to write me off</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I get a chance to betray him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">anybody else."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He whipped his head to the west-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and held it rigid, eyes focusing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a clearing on the side of a ridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">about two miles distant. A small file of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men charged across that space and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared into the smother of timber</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Benton's glance ran along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edges of that particular tree mass, lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cating the adjoining clearings; and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long time he waited, expecting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party to come again into view. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">it did, however, it was only briefly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguely, in the bottom of the canyon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">58</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The course taken seemed to indicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">an intention of reaching the summit</seg><seg type="columnLine">country that he was in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not very many there, he thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Part of Wolfert's band split off, maybe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Detachment of the prairie people? No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd hang together for the big smash.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or else it is what's left of the McMur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree boys. Likely. The sad survivors of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a proud outfit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was time to move. His trail was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still fresh in the yielding turf of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills and they might cut it and follow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ten minutes more of sweeping scru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny produced no results and a last</seg><seg type="columnLine">look to the prairie netted nothing. Im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled then by the sense of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasted, he left the pinnacle and quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered to its foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I drift backward," he said to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, "I gain nothing and lose ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If I sidestep I keep in 'touch--" That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as far as his thinking went.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Through the trees and along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bending trail Rae McMurtree's cry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half scream and half call of warning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came shrill and shocking, and ended</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a high note. The effect of it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">literally to throw Benton back on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels, and he hung in that odd balance</seg><seg type="columnLine">till the cry, seeming to be released by</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific force, struck the shaky silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Benton plunged forward with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head lowered, boots battering the soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. His hand lowered once and rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatically, and thus he rounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bend and raced over the little glade</seg><seg type="columnLine">with gun lifted and searching. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn the hammer half back before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw that he could not shoot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl, struck to her knees, rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">with both hands reached forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The'dore--the slash-cheeked, sullen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visaged The'dore--stepped away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and cursed morosely; then Rae's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">arms went around him with a frenzied</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength and for a moment checked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his draw. She was aware of Benton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">return. The'dore, spilling over with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage, had not yet discovered the fact;</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his thoughts were on the girl. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted her with a heave of his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders, got one arm free, and struck her</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the face with a force that</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked her down again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was then that his shifting glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">found Benton. Instantly The'dore's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body stiffened. A wild and vicious and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunted expression flashed across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulky cheeks and thereafter settled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fixed mask of incredible hatred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rae," cried Benton, fury throbbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the words, "step aside from him!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The'dore took a step toward the ris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing girl, clearly meaning to use her for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shield. But he was checked by Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's veering gun muzzle and the dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat-toned command, "Stick to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl turned to Benton and start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to speak, but she saw his gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">riveted to The'dore and apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood the danger of diverting it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">White and trembling, she moved back</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of range.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The'dore," droned Benton, "you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">prowled too long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've got the drop on me," mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered The'dore between his teeth.

A woodpecker attacked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of a dead tree above them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long, staccato rapping broke the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace.

He straightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, catching a forward gesture</seg><seg type="columnLine">on The'dore's part, and for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">dully dragging interval he studied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">McMurtree foreman keenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now get on your pony and fog out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of here," he said at last.

He rolled a cigarette, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt gradually curling into his lip</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners. Catching this shift of temper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton realized he had misjudged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. The'dore mistook mildness for</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakness. *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll never get in the clear,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneered The'dore.

His long body, set</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the chance, hurtled the distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck Benton viciously and knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him back. The'dore's big arms locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Benton's waist. He tripped Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton and fell with him and the sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of his body knocked the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely out of Benton's chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half paralyzed, Benton tried to roll</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear and got a sledgelike smash on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the temple.

At that, Benton's breath came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to him at a rush. His arms were</seg><seg type="columnLine">free. Lifting them, he caught The'dore</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the neck and at the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked the man's body upward with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet. The'dore emitted a strangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">yell and capsized on one shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken clear of Benton.

Stunned and shaken, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a fair target and Benton went for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with relentless fury, ripping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-mad face with driving fists. The-</seg><seg type="columnLine">'dore tried to bring his own arms into</seg><seg type="columnLine">play. He groped uncertainly, and tried</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for his bear hug.

We sighted it just before we left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ranch. Half the prairie in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">troop. You know what those fellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">aim to do, don't you? Sure. Wipe out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the McMurtrees for once and for good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'd do it, too, and never let us</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout for mercy. I said we had to pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fiddler, didn't I? We're through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only thing now is to get out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country and disappear complete. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't any more McMurtree outfit." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the girl, gently adding, "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried your dad in the grave lot, Rae.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was The'dore that shot him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The girl nodded and turned away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them, walking back toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, this is wasting time," Lin</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.

They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought up The'dore's horse and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">tying his feet under the animal's belly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his hands to the horn. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">group mounted and steadied him; The-</seg><seg type="columnLine">'dore was waking with a painful reflex</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his muscles. The scarred face turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">from side to side, only half recognizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation. He said, thickly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get Benton--that's the main thing.''</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then his mind cleared and he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at his roped wrists. "You ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">got me yet!" he bawled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Nobody answered him. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to Lin McMurtree, full of fear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but McMurtree stared back expression-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You think Wolfert's men held to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether?" asked Benton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Maybe, maybe not," judged Lin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They took a lot of punishment. Ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">so many left as you'd think. I'd hate</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go through a fight like that again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was hell--just plain hell. If those</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooks stick by Wolfert now, they're</seg><seg type="columnLine">bigger gluttons for punishment than</seg><seg type="columnLine">I take 'em to be." He bowed his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite thoughtful. "You want my</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight opinion of it? Well, this coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try has had a housecleanin'. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned odd fashion. Two crooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides killed each other off. Ain't that</seg><seg type="columnLine">somethin' to laugh over?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boys," said The'dore, pleading his</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, "if you'll let me go and give me</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gun, I'll swear I'll never stop ridin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">till I knock Wolfert out of the saddle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So help me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was entirely ignored.

"I'm not going with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Lin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?" grumbled Lin. "Lord, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't think we'd leave you--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not going," she said firmly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, how're you going to take care</seg><seg type="columnLine">of yourself when--" Lin began. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">another thought came to him and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled his head about and stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton sharply. "So that's it, huh?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," said the girl. "That's it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you aim to do?"

Benton</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard The'dore lift his voice in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked, wild-toned cursing, and this i</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued until the distance absorbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice and hoofbeat alike.

"You realize, Jim, that the sher-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">iff will be with those Blackrock men?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I know," he said, smiling grimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But we can't dodge it forever, Rae.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It's only--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She put out her arm and stopped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him.

Benton left the glade by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">its sloping edge, tackled the steeper</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">side, and reached a canyon's bed. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deer trail went dimly along It, through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sedge and little pools made by the con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">densing mists. They came to a cross</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gulch, took it and by degrees worked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out of the high terrain into lower and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more open country. Far behind rose a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">single shot. TJrie sunlight began to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reach between the thinning tree tops</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and they passed across alternate strips</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of shadow and golden puddles of light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A vista of the far-reaching prairie</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">opened before them.

They kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">? cutting off my view. The hills have</seg><seg type="columnLine">i been a hiding-place for my family all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time. I don't want to hide any</seg><seg type="columnLine">j more!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">' "From the porch of my house," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton, "the whole world rolls away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jim," said the girl simply, "you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">not through with Wolfert yet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," answered Benton.

The girl spurred abreast of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton and they crossed the meadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a canter and entered a thicket of</seg><seg type="columnLine">willows. Beyond that they halted. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton clearing lay ahead, buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathed by the mid-morning sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stay here till I go see if we've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitors," Benton said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he spurred across the open and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the far side of the main house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were no ponies standing about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dismounting, he went inside the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">and explored it thoroughly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Satisfied, he went out and signaled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the girl, who rode up and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dad," mused Benton, "had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of being a permanent citizen. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">built this place to last. Even now, idle</seg><seg type="columnLine">for so many years, it's still sound. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">little repairing would make it snug</seg><seg type="columnLine">and comfortable. Like it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another time," she answered very</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly, "I'll tell you about that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She wheeled abruptly and entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house. Benton grinned slowly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strolled into the yard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a strange feeling in him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had been sure of nothing. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been knocked about, betrayed and shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">at until all his thoughts were cautious</seg><seg type="columnLine">and trimmed to each short day. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manence was something he never had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known. Safety had always depended</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his own vigilance, his own keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceptions. And so, with his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">planted on soil that belonged to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that strange, unusual feeling grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger and stronger. It was as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were putting his roots down like some</seg><seg type="columnLine">64</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thirsty plant seeking water.

Look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about, he saw Rae</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing at a second-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stOry window. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand pointed, not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but to the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction of the willows. Instant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly on the alert, he turned, and his rac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing glance caught a slow weaving of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brush over there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the moment he stood still, real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">izing the target he made. The line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">willows was five hundred feet away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">admirable shelter. He immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed that he was not engaged with</seg><seg type="columnLine">any part of the Blackrock posse. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">men would not be hiding in the brush.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was with Wolfert's partisans he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to deal. Eyeing the willow edges, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered no other point of activity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and meanwhile the movement at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first point ceased. One man. then. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">this man crouched for a sure aim. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant a rifle--no revolver could effec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively reach a target at such distance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Very slowly wheeling, Benton idled</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the house with an exaggerated</seg><seg type="columnLine">show of indifference.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Between himself and the house stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pump and water trough. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shelter he wanted against that</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening gun, and as inconspicuous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly as he could make it, he slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted his march to come behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy planks of the trough. Meanwhile</seg><seg type="columnLine">his leisurely striding covered the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Not until he was within a few paces</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the trough did his gait quicken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he made one great forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His leap broke the intolerable strain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of waiting. A crackling echo filled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing and a rifle bullet plucked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air hungrily beside him. He dived for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trough and rolled behind it; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the marksman opened up with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry abandon. Lead began to thud</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the planks. Jets of dust leaped like</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake heads at the exact meeting point</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trough corner and ground. Tallying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shots with cold calculation, Benton</seg><seg type="columnLine">was prepared when silence fell at last.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he held his place, waiting for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">more explosion. He knew that trick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the seconds ticked on, however, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew impatient of his sightless posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and decided on another old trick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took his hat and pushed it slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the end of the planks. Instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward it was whipped from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and went rolling away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was the break he waited for. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer interval would follow before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marksman could get his fresh load</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the rifle. Pulling himself erect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benton left the trough on the run, aim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for the house. An enormous bellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove out of the brush; swinging his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance to the willows he saw Hale</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolfert smash through them and ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear in the open. Wolfert lifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle and threw it away. He reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his revolver, came directly on for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of a hundred feet and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled. A little later he vanished be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Damn fool," said Benton to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. "He threw off his advantage when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dropped the rifle. What's the mat</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter with the man?" But as he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question, he thought he knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer. Wolfert was quite sure of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own power; he now elected to close in</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEUDISTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">65</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and end the debate with the revolver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Benton ran along the porch of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">house and reached the open yard be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yond. Wolfert appeared at about the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">same time, not farther than two hun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dred yards off. Pie saw Benton at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">same moment that Benton saw him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Instantly he turned from his direct</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">charge, passed on to an adjacent wa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gon shed, and got out of sight. Benton</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came to a halt and waited,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">j He had a very brief wait. Wolfert</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">j&gt; appeared on the left of the wagon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shed. He saw Benton stationed there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by the smokehouse and broke forward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into a run. The next moment, however,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he came to a halt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Benton," called Wolfert, "let's do</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> no more dodgin'. I'm cornin' straight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> at you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Come on," said Benton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Wolfert held his peace briefly, look-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ing all about. Then he returned his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> gaze to Benton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "If you've got any guts," he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced, "you'll stand your ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">r and settle this now."</seg><seg type="columnLine">j. "I'm waiting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At that, Wolfert raised his gun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I started to run with his head half low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">[ ered. The two hundred yards quickly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•	became a hundred and fifty. Benton</seg><seg type="columnLine">, stood quite still, small and stray im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressions registering in a mind other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise coldly concentrated. Somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 behind Wolfert--somewhere over by</seg><seg type="columnLine">I the willows--was the sound of horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">solidly pacing down out of the hills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Benton lifted his gun, seeing more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clearly than anything else the big plaid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">checkers on Wolfert's shirt. One of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">those checkers was broader and bright-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">er than the others. At a hundred yards</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">j Wolfert lifted his head and began to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fire, not slowing his pace,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">j Unconscious ,of it, Benton winced as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the first slug went beside him. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still waiting for the interval to</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow, thinking of nothing now but</seg><seg type="columnLine">one shot--only one shot--accurately</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed. He felt Wolfert's second bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit at his feet. Then he shifted slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his tracks, pulled his weapon to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">level of his eyes, and fired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a direct hit and it jarred Wol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fert out of his forward advance with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effect of a solid blow. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened and stiffened, and across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brutally stamped visage passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange and astonished and fearful</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression that was a sure forecast of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fate. Benton made no attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">try another shot. He knew. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen that? expression before on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces of men just before they died in</seg><seg type="columnLine">violence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound of horses welled across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meadow and rather faintly he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back-and-forth calling of many</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. But it was of no importance at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this moment. Wolfert shook his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders. His gun slipped from relaxing</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers. He issued a strangled cough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear staring out of his eyes. And then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling against it, he fell loosely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. Benton pivoted away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wishing to see no more. Lifting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, he found the meadow full of rid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers. A group of four circled the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">and charged toward him. All of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered him with their guns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it's Wolfert you want, Sheriff,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said calmly, "you're too late."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no doubt about the sher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iff; his vest held a shining star.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're Reno?" asked the lawman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I used to travel under that name.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm Hi Benton's son, back home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So," said the sheriff interestedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He bent forward in the saddle, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely inspecting Benton.

He reached into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket. The motion brought the trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns quickly down on him, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled and drew out a folded bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper. He walked over and handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it up to the sheriff. "The deal was</seg><seg type="columnLine">framed.

Well, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">was I going to get into this country?</seg><seg type="columnLine">If I rode into Blackrock as an ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand I'd be suspected of something</seg><seg type="columnLine">right away.

His head nodded slightly as if Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's talk satisfied some long-suspend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed judgment. He had a reputation for</seg><seg type="columnLine">taciturnity and quick action, and now;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he justified the reputation by reaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his pocket and throwing a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">folded sheet to the ground.

So he had fired a rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot high above the head of the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">wielding the wire cutters--and to Kil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare's amazement the fellow had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped in his tracks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swiftly investigating, Kildare had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the man, a total stranger, dead;</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rifle bullet had torn clear through</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Then, most abruptly, Larsen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parks had appeared with the sheriff--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and Joe Kildare went over the road on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a murder charge. He believed he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had happened. Parks had a rider</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Flame Halliday, who had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">killer's record. He must have been hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den near by and, when Kildare fired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Halliday shot simultaneously, murder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Parks's fence-cutting pawn. Still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe Kildare couldn't prove it--they</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't give him a chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he inched forward, alert again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested in spite of his own driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">obsession.

Two streaks of flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">licked out toward Armstrong as he sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">astride his wheeling horse, before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got his own weapon unlimbered. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fired once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Drake, swaying drunkenly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle, was carried a hundred feet by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his snorting mount before he slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its back. A little spiral of dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose slowly from the figure huddled on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dry grass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Armstrong rode over, swung off, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the man on the ground. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed back his hat, mopped his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his bandanna, then mounted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">loped away up the valley. Drake's</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened horse, had vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The brief mountain twilight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fading when the gaunt scarecrow with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sunken eyes and whisker-stubbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks stole out of the aspens to limp</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GUN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">down and stop by the still body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farley Drake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seems like Fate gave me this chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to heel myself, he thought, unbuckling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead man's gun belt and putting it</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his own lean hips. He pried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colt out of Drake's stiffening fingers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The effort made him weak and dizzy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How feeble and shaky he was--in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition he could hardly hope to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tackle Parks and his hired killer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something to eat, a good night's sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">--these he needed before he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare to try it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But could he afford to take the time?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pursuit might be close at this very mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, though he had seen no signs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it for three days now.

And her husband</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothed her hair, kissed her, patted</seg><seg type="columnLine">her shoulder, seemed to be speaking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">reassuring words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">All this the ragged fugitive had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen, peering into the lighted room be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he climbed into the hayloft.

Tempted almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond endurance, he still stuck to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">place in the concealing hay. He dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">not reveal himself to ask for food--</seg><seg type="columnLine">George and Molly knew him, knew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">record.

He went out on the street, got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the palomino, and rode it across to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarding-corral, where he left it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Coming back to the main street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steve met the Raniers.

He went on past them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed for the courthouse. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the girl before he got there. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was coming out of a narrow-fronted</seg><seg type="columnLine">store with a package. She looked first</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the glittering shield, then at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. She smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks a lot for tellin' me about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leemans," he said quietly. "How's your</seg><seg type="columnLine">father? Now that he's got Frisk Ranier</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do all the fightin', looks like it'd be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good time to take a trip."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish he would. He's really not</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. But he has a stubborn streak in</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He hates fighting. He never was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fighter. He likes peace and quiet, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knows that the county expects him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run away from the Whinrights. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's suddenly decided to stay right</seg><seg type="columnLine">right here and--and face being killed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wish I could persuade him to go up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Dallas or Fort Worth or Temple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and have specialists look him over.

Mr. Tormey--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have to be 'Mister'?" he asked her</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly. "I'd a lot rather you said Steve.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would it strain you just a lot?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Steve," she said, and flushed. "Steve,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm glad you're going to be here. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though my father says you're just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy, that Frisk makes an ideal chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">deputy, and that you couldn't hope to</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle killers like the Whinrights, es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecially Snake. Curt is bad enough, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's nothing, compared to his brother.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You have to get a pistol, don't you?

"An'</seg><seg type="columnLine">if these Whinrights are so plumb dead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, maybe a couple shotguns'll be what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I need. Well, I'll try to be around to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of pick up the pieces after Frisk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">If he'll knock 'em down, I'll stack</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em-- Who's that doin' all the yellin'?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">She listened, half turning. From a</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon two or three buildings down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street came Wolf-howls.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">took Ables's collar and ducked him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted him, ducked him, until Abies</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back to consciousness with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great thrashing of arms and tremen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous sputterings.

I was won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derin' if you couldn't send him off to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dallas, to be looked over by the special</seg><seg type="columnLine">docs up there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He'd see through that," Dr. Higgins</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, shaking his head. "Only chance I</seg><seg type="columnLine">see is that his fright will combine with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his actual poor health--or rather, act</seg><seg type="columnLine">so upon it--that he'll be knocked out."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But if it don't--" Steve stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemplated Higgins, then leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly forward. "Doc, couldn't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">give him some medicine that'd put him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bed for a few days?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Higgins stared, then began to grin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I certainly could do that!

But if I do that</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you, will you help me do some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing? Something the beloved sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his newly acquired deputy won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that?" Steve asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Grab Marquez!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Who's Marquez?" Steve frowned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's he done?" *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's done one murder that's of rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ord. He'll do another tonight if he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">not stopped. But Mahr and Frisk</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ranier insist he's not even in town. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know he is! He's hanging out at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toro, a tough Mex joint in South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Town. He's going to kill a kid named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Torres tonight. Torres is set to marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">a girl Marquez wants. Will you go with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, after a while, down to the Toro?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"O' course. If he's in town, an' a</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderer, he's in my bailiwick. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">my job--an' none o' yours.

Ready now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before they went out of the doctor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">door Steve made one slight adjustment</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his costume. He unpinned the shield</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his jumper and put it into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll walk straight down to this Toro</seg><seg type="columnLine">place," he told Higgins. "I'll go in side</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' look around. You can stop behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and if you see this Marquez, tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Has he got any scars or anything?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No scars. But he's tall, almost as</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall as I. His face is yellow, not brown.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His nose is as hooked as the Raniers'</seg><seg type="columnLine">family proboscis. His eyes are very</seg><seg type="columnLine">small and very dark. He usually wears</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray cotton pants, rammed into half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boots. And I remember that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars and crescents on his bootlegs."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'd know him in church," Steve</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded. "Let's go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He attracted no attention when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to that end of the main street off</seg><seg type="columnLine">which jutted ragged cross streets lined</seg><seg type="columnLine">with unplastered 'dobes. He found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toro without difficulty, for a blue bull</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced it--a large, snorty bull on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a plank sign over the Toro's central</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. Without seeming to take care to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be quiet, he came very softly up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Chapter Five</seg><seg type="columnLine">An Old Spanish Custom</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T THE Toro, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bar of sorts, home-</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of native wood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a store on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big room. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">some homemade ta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bles and benches and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rawhide-bottomed chairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steve did not need to wait for Hig-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gins to identify Marquez. He saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting at a table, face to the door. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the table with him was that red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed cowboy who had brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telegram to Sheriff Mahr, and who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone instantly to tell Zeke Ranier of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its contents. Somehow, the association</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed odd to Steve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he went in and loafed over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bar, stopping near the table. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the cowboy staring at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When Marquez looked suddenly his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way he thought probably the cowboy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had jogged the Mexican's knee under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table. But he asked for tequila in</seg><seg type="columnLine">English. The bartender spoke a Span-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish sentence, asking what brand of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tequila he wanted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steve shook his head impatiently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No sabe," he said, and. again, "Te-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quila!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He does not speak Spanish," Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quez grunted to the cowboy. "You say</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is now the marshal? And that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw Abies into the water trough? It</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not seem possible! Is he one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those fools who does not wear a gun?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I do not see one about him, or sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. I think I will amuse myself, Rojo</seg><seg type="columnLine">amigo--watch!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marquez came up in a lithe, swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement. He lounged over to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steve stood with the tequila lifted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand, humming. Marquez jostled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steve's elbow. The tequila splashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Steve's jumper, upon his face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the floor. Marquez's face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted apologetically. He stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, flinging up both hands in a ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of concern and spoke in smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish, in the tone which would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">used in an apology:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dirty cur of the alleys!

They dropped heads upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tables and roared. For Steve's irri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated expression had softened. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling at Marquez. The Mexican</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned with artistically bewildered</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, to stare at the laughing men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They laughed the louder, the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">hysterically. He shook his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned back to Steve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will be very funny!

How can a man who is not here</seg><seg type="columnLine">trim your ears? Ah, yes, it is too sad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Too sad that you do not understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spanish."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steve gestured toward the chair at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marquez's table. He moved over to it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">put his hand on its back, and smiled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marquez. The redheaded cowboy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaning back in his chair, his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">working.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," said Steve, in fluent pela'o</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish, "who said that I do not under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand Spanish?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pushed sideways with his hip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The table moved, catching the cowboy</seg><seg type="columnLine">off balance. He fell backward. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair came flashing up in Steve's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. It crashed down upon Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quez's head. The murderer dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the groan of a pole-axed bull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was still the shaky silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had come with Steve's words in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish. He stepped backward until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was against the wall. Sidelong, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the redhead, who was furi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously scrambling up, hand going inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you!" Steve snapped at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Or I'll stitch buttonholes up an' down</seg><seg type="columnLine">ypur bellyband!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hands twinkled. The flaps of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumper front twitched. Out of the John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wesley Hardin vest's slanting holsters</seg><seg type="columnLine">came twin walnut-handled Colts. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">one in Steve's left hand continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward. l£ crashed across the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of the cowboy. He slumped, six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun falling out of his limp fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A'right, Doc," Steve called, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Higgins stepped into the room. In his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand the doctor carried, lightly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily, the very short-barreled shotgun</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had worn into South Town</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his coat. "Right on back!" Steve</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll take Rojo outside, first," he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided. "Watch Marquez a minute. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wiggles, let him have the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistlers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reholstered the Colts, caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">redhead by pants seat and jumper</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, and swung him up easily. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked through the room to the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and half turned, letting the cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy fall to the dust of the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He went back and, with Higgins</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing guard by the table, took Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quez with left hand under chin, right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand at the back of the head. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not lift the senseless murderer; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely dragged him to the door. Hig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gins followed. There broke, then, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gabble of voices within the Toro. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody came out of the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were horses in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toro. Steve grunted and Higgins went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and got two, taking down the lar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iats from the big-horned saddles. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">loop under the arms of each prisoner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a turn around the horns, then Higgins</seg><seg type="columnLine">went into one saddle, Steve -into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. They started toward town. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind them in the dust the prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">84</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">plowed along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marquez yelled suddenly and Steve</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked back at him. Marquez caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold of the lariat and jumped to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. Steve kicked the Mexican horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a trot, then into a lope. Marquez</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to run, faster and faster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steve grinned tightly. Marquez could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do nothing but hang to tlie lariat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to keep his feet. So they came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front of Leemans's store. Steve</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked the pony to an extra burst of</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, whirled him off to one side, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped Marquez into the air. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw himself out of saddle and ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the rope as to a calf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had a gun in his hand, now. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rammed the muzzle into Marquez's</seg><seg type="columnLine">belly, searched him swiftly, took a pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pearl-handled .38s, self-cockers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dagger from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leemans and others from the store</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch came slowly out. Higgins rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward them, with the redhead walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing beside his stirrup. Steve grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the storekeeper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd like a couple of tug chains an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">some locks. I could slam Marquez into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the calaboose, but I'd rather chain him</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the cottonwood yonder. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">much chance his gettin' out, then."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he had adjusted a trace chain</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the Mexican's neck and locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, then locked another chain around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tree trunk, he looked thoughtfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the cowboy, who stood sullenly by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Higgins. The cowboy was a shade un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain of face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the hell's this?" Frisk Ranier</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded abruptly, shoving belliger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently through the watching, grinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">townsmen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just try in' to figurate," Steve said</seg><seg type="columnLine">mildly, "if it ought to be an arrest or</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a warnin'.

"You!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What the hell!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steve passed the weapons taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Marquez to Higgins. Then Frisk</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ranier jumped savagely at him, hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">curled into huge, knotted fists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Steve was not there, on the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiving end.

Frisk was snarling</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him. "I'll bust y' damn head in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute. Come on! You're goin' to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">company." Then he stopped short and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at Steve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a prisoner ought to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours," he growled. "Him an' some</seg><seg type="columnLine">more was tryin' to get into the feed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">store back door. If you'll ram his rump</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the lock-up, I know where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest went. Here's the keys."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steve nodded, grinning faintly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the iron keys and the prisoner's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm, leading him toward the jail. Frisk</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished between the buildings again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went into the sheriff's office</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Steve took a match from his hat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">86</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">band. He shoved the man toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the darkroom and the match</seg><seg type="columnLine">flared in his hand. He saw the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement as a blur and, as the gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame came with the roar of the shot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was down on one knee and to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of where he had been. The match</seg><seg type="columnLine">was out in a snap. There was a creak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sound as the man shifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of his pants pocket Steve work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed hiB heavy stock knife. He flung it</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that it rapped the door beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, then sprang up and toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man as he jumped. He smashed down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward with his Colts barrel, downward</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and again. The man's fall was</seg><seg type="columnLine">preceded by the thump of his pistol on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fix! Steve thought swiftly. Frisk's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fix! He'll be cornin' to sweep up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces. Let's see, now--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found the dropped gun, rehol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stered his own, rammed the other one</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his waistband. He picked up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and almost trotted out of the of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fice and around the building to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corral. He clucked softly to himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for another horse, saddled, was now in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corral beside the palomino. He put</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limp body across the saddle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured it with quick turns of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's lariat. Then he took the horse's</seg><seg type="columnLine">reins and swung up on the palomino.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rode softly out of town and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mesquite growth. He tied the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">securely to a thick bush, gagged him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the tail of his own shirt, hobbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horse, and rode back to town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hitching the palomino behind a house</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty yards from the sheriff's office, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved carefully and quietly up toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the courthouse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There were men standing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness beside the building. Low</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices carried to Steve as he worked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So I reckon she's all right," Frisk</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ranier was saying confidently. "Jerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely carted him off to hide some'r's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You think everybody believed you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red, about droppin' your gun an' it</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin' off?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Shore they did!" Zeke Ranier</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarled. "Time to git goin'. We don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to give Leemans time to finish</seg><seg type="columnLine">countin' an' lock up. That damn ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">press safe's like to be grief enough."</seg><seg type="columnLine">They moved off. Steve stood staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">after them, then whirled and went at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogtrot along the backs of the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings that fronted this side of the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">street. He came to the back door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor's house and rapped upon it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently the doctor spoke through it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steve gave his name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doc, if you'd like some practice</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that Greener, slip a dozen buck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot shells into your pockets an' come</seg><seg type="columnLine">on out. The fun'll be at Leemans's!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm ahead of you!" Higgins cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In rather less than two minutes he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with Steve, the shotgun over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went quietly toward Leemans's</seg><seg type="columnLine">store.* Steve whispered to Higgins, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, flattening himself against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. Steve went on, putting down each</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot cautiously. Inch by inch, almost,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came to the door of the store. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard someone breathing in the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way-embrasure. He stiffened, breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing silently himself. The Colt lifted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right hand. He leaned forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scientifically, he swung the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrel when he had located the sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try's head, then stepped forward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the man's slumping body under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arms. He stood still, holding it up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and listening. From within the store,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere out of sight, came a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">drone of voices. He stepped backward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">SHERIFF TROUBLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">moving slowly, supporting the limp</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he was ten feet back, he set</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body down. Higgins came to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steve brought out a pair of handcuffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave them to the doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take this hairpin somewhere you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can cuff his hands behind him around</seg><seg type="columnLine">somethin'. Then go to the front door</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' rattle it an' call out. I'll be inside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookin' things over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went back as Higgins picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the senseless lookout and turned away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He went into the door and worked to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward Leemans's office. Before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached it he could see Red, the cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy, and another man whom he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, standing outside of the office</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. Light came from inside, to shine</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their faces. Odd, he thought, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither of these was masked. Leemans</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew Red, certainly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved closer. An unfamiliar</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice was talking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So that's all you can rake up, huh?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Less'n three thousand! Leemans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're a double-damn liar. You got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll for half the cowmen an' saloon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keepers in this neck o' the woods. Talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, or we'll roast your feet! Where you</seg><seg type="columnLine">got the real money hid?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the front corner of the store</seg><seg type="columnLine">where was housed the express office</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men came. Steve could not see</seg><seg type="columnLine">their faces. But nearing the door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leemans's office, they spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We better take that damn safe out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the mesquite an' blow her," Zeke</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ranier said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hell!" This from Frisk Ranier. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">could easy hide her a long way off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blow her any time. Don't need to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bother about tonight. I'll git the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hawsses."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I tell you"--this was Leemans's</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate voice from within--"that's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">every last cent that's in the place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snake! Every last cent. Sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">they's more, but now--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came to Steve the flat sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a blow, then the level, almost tone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less voice that had threatened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storekeeper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Curt, you bring that lamp off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. Set her on the floor. Ram some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin' in his mouth so he can't howl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Go on an' git the hawsses, Frisk. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' Zeke snake that safe out an' hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">her in the brush. Then cover up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks. Me an' Curt'll be plenty to</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle this illegitimate. We'll roast his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steve scowled uncertainly. The Ra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">niers were beginning to move toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Then from the front door came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattle of handle and latch and a yelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, demanding Leemans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Slide around!" the grim voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">barked. "See who that damn fool is.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bend a gun barrel over his knot--</seg><seg type="columnLine">hightail!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stick 'em up!" Steve yelled. "Stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em up! You're surrounded!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then several things happened in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">twinkling. The light went out in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office. From the windows in front fil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered a pallid glow of street light. Fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures moving hurriedly were silhouettes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the passage between the counters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the store. Steve squatted. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor in front of the office door breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed flame. He heard lead singing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roar of the guns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had the advantage of them. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was low; he could shape them in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimness. He fired steadily, if half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindedly as to actual targets--right-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand Colt, left-hand Colt. And there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the boom of a shotgun from far</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at the front: Higgins was unlim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber ing there. Another boom--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be the other barrel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">88</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But they were running at Steve now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He fired as rapidly as he could snap</seg><seg type="columnLine">back the big hammers and let them</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop. A man fell across him, groaning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steve, gun empty, snatched; his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">•touched the metal of a carbine. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked at it, got it, straightened, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran backward toward the door. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one cannoned into him, swore, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coiled. He rammed the carbine muzzle</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, felt it prod flesh, cocked it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed trigger, then ran on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood outside of the back door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carbine up. Someone was yelling from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front. He made out his name, final-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--we got 'em cut off back here!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he yelled in answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men came running around1 the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner of the store. They called to him--</seg><seg type="columnLine">called him "Marshal." He answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtly, then sent a yell into the store.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Somebody in there light a lamp!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Game's up--we got you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no answer. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men behind Steve went down the line</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came back with a lantern. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was lighted Steve took it from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and bent, to set it inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">store.-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing happened. He slid in and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side. Someone was groaning, up</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leemans!" Steve called, stooping</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously. "Leemans?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," the storekeeper answer-*</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. "I--I'm all right. Who's that?

Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">' Steve went slowly up toward the of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fice. Frisk Ranier and his father were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying there. They had virtually been</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot to pieces; he saw evidence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">many pistol and rifle slugs as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">shotgun charges. He looked in at Lee-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mans, who sat at his desk with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand feeling shakily of his blood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dabbled forehead. Then he poked on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Snake Whinright had almost made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front of the store when a blast of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunfire from the broken windows had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Calling to those outside the store,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steve went back to Leemans. Presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">the store was crowded. Steve listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Leemans's tale of the holdup.

They were dealing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and betting silently. Angel estimated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the size of the game. At least two</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars variously stacked be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the five. If a man could clean that</seg><seg type="columnLine">game! And Angel had cleaned many a</seg><seg type="columnLine">poker game--as well as having himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone to the cleaners in others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked out, along the street to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Post Oak County Bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A tall, thin-faced, dark man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the open floor space flanked</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a teller's and cashier's grilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">cage glared and stormed. Colonel John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hyams stood behind the counter with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands on the mahogany surface.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The colonel's genial old face wore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixture of annoyance and apprehen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. Colonel John was, strictly speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, the Post Oak County Bank--an</seg><seg type="columnLine">institution in person as well as finan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially. He' had been casting funds on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limited waters and boundless</seg><seg type="columnLine">plains of the Post Oak country for two</seg><seg type="columnLine">decades and watching it come back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him manifold, with the good will of</seg><seg type="columnLine">every cattleman he dealt with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was no atmosphere of</seg><seg type="columnLine">good will in that room when Angel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Patmore stepped through the doorway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew the tall, dark-visaged man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew blind fury when he saw it</seg><seg type="columnLine">written on the human countenance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he knew Colonel John for a kind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, upright soul who would rather help</seg><seg type="columnLine">than harm any man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Angel's eyes dwelt curiously on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack Ratsey's right arm and hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">after one glance at his flaming face. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen men in that same tense-</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed posture before, oblivious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything except a venomous passion</seg><seg type="columnLine">to destroy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hence Angel was quite prepared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was an instinctive reaction on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own part. He knew that Ratsey was</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting ready to go for his gun. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">DOLLARS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not know what it was all about. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not care. To Angel it was sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder, no matter what provocation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what grievance had worked Ratsey up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the killing pitch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Thus, when the curving fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed on the grip of the .45 with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward swoop, Angel, whose muscular</seg><seg type="columnLine">motions were as lightning-quick as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">agile brain, was drawing also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And only one shot cracked in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">room with a flash and a roar magnified</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the enclosing walls. Ratsey stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripping his right hand with his left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His gun fell with a clatter halfway</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the house of money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That'll be enough from you, Mister</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack Ratsey," Angel said. "And you</seg><seg type="columnLine">two--" He frowned at a cashier and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledger clerk who had each pulled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun. " 'Tend to your pencil-pushin'.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You were both a mile behind, anyway."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ratsey's mouth opened in a snarl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He rubbed at his numbed hand. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glared at Angel, at Colonel John. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers had only suffered from shock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He gave that hand a last tentative</seg><seg type="columnLine">shake and stooped for his gun. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">that retrieved he bent burning eyes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angel Patmore, slim, small, watchful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsmiling. Angel looked like a school-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy in riding-boots and Stetson--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ratsey knew better than that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You can go as far as you like, Jack,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angel said softly. "But what's the use</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bein' a damn' fool twice in one day?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll see you later," Ratsey muttered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Both of you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll always see you first," Angel</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man went out, head down, mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering to himself. Colonel John looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the counter and sighed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was right smart of you, An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gelo," he said. "You certainly kept me</seg><seg type="columnLine">from bein' meat for the undertaker."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO CLINK	95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe he was just aimin' to run a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluff of some kind," Angel suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--" Colonel John shook his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">--"he'd gone toco.

"Still, 'twasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothin' a-tall."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Give your check to Smith." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">colonel indicted the cashier. "Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into my office and have a drink."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel John's hand shook as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured two drinks from a decanter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ratsey was terrible worked up," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained.

Shootin' at a fortune.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stands to lose it all if he don't raise a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred thousand to carry him over</seg><seg type="columnLine">till fall. I never did consider him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good risk. Too much temper and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough judgment. I just wouldn't let</seg><seg type="columnLine">him have any part of that sum. He lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's sure a darned poor specimen."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angel frowned. "Pullin' his gun on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">unarmed man. Everybody in Texas</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows you never packed a pistol in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your life. Yes, I think he was fixin' to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill you. He shore looked wall-eyed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know he was," Colonel John ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted. "And now, darn it, he'll prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably try to kill you on sight. I'm wor-.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried about that, Angel.

Angel shrugged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're bound to meet, operatin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">here in the same territory," old Hyams</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumbled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe.

How come?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me'n' Luke's parted." Angel ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained, a little sadly.

"What do you aim to do?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Go north to a new country and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a stake," Angel voiced his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solve. "This is the last money I got,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all I got.

There's a good liberal</seg><seg type="columnLine">game goin' in Bill Morrow's place. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin' to clean it or be cleaned."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Colonel John nodded comprehension.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If I don't see you again, Angelo," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, after a little pause, "remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. You done me a good turn a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes ago. If you got any ambition</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could help you gratify, I'd stretch a</seg><seg type="columnLine">point."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man's got to gratify his own am-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bitions," Angel said slowly. "He ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">much good if he needs a wet nurse."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel John grinned and stuck out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand. "Well, you remember what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said," he concluded. "If you ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to holler for anything you think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of John Hyams in Post Oak, Texas.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've known wild, gamblin' rip-roarin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">kids that was pretty good men in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinch. You do know the cow business,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angel. Stay with that and you'll wear</seg><seg type="columnLine">diamonds."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Angel went a trifle warily down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street to Morrow's. Post Oak, since he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot that gun out of Ratsey's hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">held immediate danger for him. If old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luke Karsten should get to brooding</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the indignity Angel had visited</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him that morning he might come</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding in also. There was a matter be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween them that Angel hated to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. Not that Angel worried as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his way to that poker game. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">being, for all his years and his boyish</seg><seg type="columnLine">smallness, potentially deadly in a pri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vate war, he preferred peace. In any</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, regardless of enemies and gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder lightning, pride would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have him dodge out of Post Oak until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he chose to go. Meantime, that poker</seg><seg type="columnLine">game lured him. The time to gamble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told himself, was when a man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to lose. Possessing resources,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was better to be conservative. So--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angel joined the watching crowd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his back to the wall just in case</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ratsey came looking for trouble. Card</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense told him in five minutes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one cowpuncher in that game was out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">classed. Angel's hunch was right. With-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in twenty minutes there was a vacant</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. He slipped into it and slid his</seg><seg type="columnLine">five twenties across to the man bank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the game. Small capital. Starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a shoestring, Angel reflected. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could go broke in one hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">DOLLARS TO CLINK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">97</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fool for luck, he said to himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">within ten minutes. The first hole card</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealt him was a king. The second a</seg><seg type="columnLine">king. Kings back to back in a Texas</seg><seg type="columnLine">stud game. Angel wore his poker face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bet his hand like a drunken sailor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tapped himself when the last card</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Angeleno, you always were hell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluff with high cards in sight," one</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowman said, and called the bet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Angel more than doubled his money</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that first play. On his own deal he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got every chip before him in the pot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was called irrtwo places. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not go wrong. A queer glow began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">light him up inside. He was six hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred strong now. And he could not be'</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting in a better game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Homer Stultz across the table had</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty thousand cattle, owned half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">county. Stultz loved stud poker, for it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. Money was nothing to him. Paul</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stratton had three trail herds bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">north. Stratton had once bet a trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">herd on the last card to his hand in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stud game at Abilene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of an hour's play Angel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Patmore had half the chips on the ta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble piled under his chin. Paul Stratton</seg><seg type="columnLine">was signing IOU's. Stultz humped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chair. This was the sort of game</seg><seg type="columnLine">he liked. He was winning. So was An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gel. The other three were outclassed</seg><seg type="columnLine">or outlucked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in the middle of a hand Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ratsey clanked in from the rear. Ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbed in the game, Angel was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of him until he saw Ratsey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean eyes bent on him over a player's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. Ratsey did not say anything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His look was enough. Angel knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs. It annoyed him. But there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing he could do now. He did know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that something was going to be forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">--because Ratsey stood waiting until</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the remaining cowpuncher decided it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too stiff a game for him and cashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">what chips he had left. Ratsey took his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. And Ratsey was a notoriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor stud player. He seldom played,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and never in that stiff a game. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ante was ten dollars now, and the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limit. Angel knew that Ratsey was</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting in that game to ride him, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">start something.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came before long. Angel had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal. Ratsey sat on his right. Angel had</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised him out of a pot by sheer weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of money the hand before. It was Rat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sey's cut now. When Angel picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deck to deal Ratsey snarled--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Set them cards down, you pie-faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">rat!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Angel looked at him. "Don't call</seg><seg type="columnLine">names, Ratsey," he murmured. "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">ram 'em down your throat if you do."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You slipped that cut," Ratsey</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled. "I seen you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you're lookin' for trouble," An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gel replied deliberately, "it ain't nec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">essary to have an excuse. Nor is it</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to break up this game. Have</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sense."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For answer Ratsey slapped him</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the mouth. Paul Stratton clamp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed him with one powerful arm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped his draw. Angel sat, white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced, shaking, with sheer anger at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupid vindictiveness of the man. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let him go," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," both Stratton and Stultz de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared. "It's a good game, and no damn'</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool like him is goin' to break it up</seg><seg type="columnLine">that way. Get to hell outa this saloon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ratsey, and stay out till this stud game</seg><seg type="columnLine">is ended. Then if you wanta shoot it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with this Patmore kid, go to it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It'll be your own funeral."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ratsey tore himself loose, his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">livid. "You blamed runt!" he shouted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">98</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you're in Post Oak more'n another</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour I'll drop you in your tracks."</seg><seg type="columnLine">They watched him out the door, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealt again. No one commented on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incident. Angel shook it out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. He would not get Out of Post</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oak without burning powder now. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it did not crimp his play. In another</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour Stratton and the strange cowman</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimaced uncomfortably and cashed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their few remaining chips. Stratton</seg><seg type="columnLine">made out a check to bearer and gave it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Stultz, who was banker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We resign," he said. "You'n' Angelo</seg><seg type="columnLine">are too many for us. Besides, I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">business to attend to. Bet 'em high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys, an' sleep in the street."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It narrowed to Angel and Stultz.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They played four hands. Angel won</seg><seg type="columnLine">three pots. Then he laid down his last</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't like single-handed stud for</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing," he said. "For another, I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ratsey on my mind. You're winner a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, Stultz. I'm winner a lot and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">means something to me. Do you mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we close the game?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hell, no," Stultz grinned. "I'm just</seg><seg type="columnLine">playin' for pastime."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Angel cashed in, filled his pockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">with gold and silver and banknotes--</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say nothing of Paul Stratton's check.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He loosened his gun in its scabbard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned to the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey, kid!" Stultz's voice was like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiss in his ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Angel whirled. Ratsey had come in</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the rear. His gun was flashing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a level. Angel felt his hat whirl off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Ratsey's speed and accuracy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been equal to his ferocious intent An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gel Patmore would have been an added</seg><seg type="columnLine">unit to the small company on Post</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oak's Boot Hill. He left Angel no</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice. Being earnest in his desire to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">live his allotted span, Angel did his</seg><seg type="columnLine">best. Left to himself, he would no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">have tried to kill Jack Ratsey than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tried to kill him in Colonel John's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank. But this was a case of kill or be</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed. And so it was Ratsey who went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in the bluish haze from two spit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting guns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Angel knew he would have a feud</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his hands later.

In an incredibly short time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had a house of sorts, a stable, a set</seg><seg type="columnLine">of corrals created by that magic which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frontiersman carries in his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then with no more to do, for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattle must care for themselves till</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring, he paid off his Texan crew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave them railroad fare home and let</seg><seg type="columnLine">them go when they began to shiver in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first winter winds. Two men elect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stay. The others were sick for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">south and departed gladly. After which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angel sat down to compose a letter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel John Hyams.</seg><seg type="columnLine">DOLLARS TO CLINK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">103</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Any tiijie you want your money out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this stock proposition, let me know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can turn 'em over at a profit anytime.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unless a hard winter hits me, I aim</seg><seg type="columnLine">very soon to get myself crowned as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattle king. This is one grand coio</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. I had an idea it was like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">North Pole, but barring colder winters</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's got Texas backed off the map for</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass, water and timber....</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And a great deal more, because An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gel was truly in love with Montana.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he wrote to Grace Karsten he</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked more of himself and less of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. He told her that if his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and body were in Montana, his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still on the Trinity River.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having dispatched those letters, An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gel somehow felt blue and forlorn. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marias seemed suddenly a most God-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forsaken wilderness, in which he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doomed to struggle with bad weather,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straying cattle, all the contingencies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a desperate undertaking, merely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove to himself and a stubborn old</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool in Texas that he was a man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a wayward child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Angel saddled his best horse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went visiting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He was used to women. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisters in his family. Also there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grace Karsten. So that Angel was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased and surprised, rather than em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrassed, to find every man of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Diamond G absent, except the cook,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a slim, imperious-looking wisp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a girl asking him to stable his horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">and make himself at home after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">custom of the cow country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You're Angelo Patmore, aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?" She sat across the table where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on she had placed beefsteak and corn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bread and coffee hot from the cook's</seg><seg type="columnLine">range. "I'm Molly Gray."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, yes, that's me," Angel replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're a good guesser."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I saw the brand on your horse,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Molly. "Besides, Grace Karsten</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me quite a lot about you in Fort</seg><seg type="columnLine">Worth just after you quit the LUK."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I didn't quit," Angel corrected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Luke fired me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you quit the country," Molly</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned. "Like a fool."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like a no-account fool," Angel in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toned. He had the impression that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Molly Gray did not know about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">run-in with Jack Ratsey, or she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have said that. "That's what old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luke said I was. He'd be glad to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody agrees with him. I don't."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Molly cupped her hands over her</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin and stared at him. She had dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray eyes and black hair and a mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a slash of carmine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come to think of it, now that I see</seg><seg type="columnLine">you personally, perhaps Grace was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool," she said, after a minute's con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">templation that almost made Angel</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncomfortable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she did not say why. And Angel</seg><seg type="columnLine">deftly changed the subject. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered what the devil she meant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At dusk Gray came in with half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen riders. They yarned around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fireplace till midnight. When Angel</seg><seg type="columnLine">left next day Molly said to him, "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget where we live."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor did Angel forget. His horse's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoofs made many a track to the Dia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mond G through the snows of that win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. Going and coming, he would turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside here and there to look at little</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunches of XP cattle making shift</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wolf and the blizzard, nos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for grass in loose snow, wild cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a .wild country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"A gamblin' fool," he said once</seg><seg type="columnLine">scornfully. "Why, every cowman from</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to the Rio Grande is gamblin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">from season to season on weather and</seg><seg type="columnLine">104</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">water and grass.

Angel joined forces with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Diamond G. Gray led his roundup crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a month. He had fifteen thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattle north of the Big Muddy; as</seg><seg type="columnLine">many more in the south. He Was past</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty and weary of saddle work. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to Angel Patmore:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're younger and swifter than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am.

That season and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When beef gathering closed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the third summer and the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">returns came in from the Chicago</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealers Angel took stock. His original</seg><seg type="columnLine">herd had been made up of one thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand two-year-old steers, one thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">heifers. His thousand heifers had bred</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that he now owned twenty-six hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred head of stock cattle. His thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">steers, less a few winter-killed, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">netted him thirty-five thousand dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the market. He could repay Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Hyams with interest at seven per</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent, and still have a comfortable bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance in the bank, and more cattle un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der his individual brand than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">started with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Luke Karsten said I would be no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">account," he told Molly Gray.

Angel</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded. "For the fun of the*thing?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know pleasanter countries to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a livin' in. I was raised in Texas. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin' back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To stay?" Molly asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, that depends," Angel said</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully. "I got a good start here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wouldn't like to close out.

Jack Ratsey has two</seg><seg type="columnLine">brothers there. They have made their</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk.

His orig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inal meadow had grown to several</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred acres of irrigated hayland.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had five hundred tons of winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">feed stacked for a hard-weather emer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gency. He had four riders hand-picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the job. There was nothing to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eventually he landed in San Marco,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearest point to the Trinity he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could reach by train. From there he</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed for the LUK and Post Oak very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as he had left it, on the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a horse. In San Marco he met men he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, riders with whom he had work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">DOLLARS TO CLINK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">105</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the range. They passed him without</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter with me?" Angel</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked himself fretfully. "Folks don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know me any more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Angel pondered as he rode down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Trinity Valley. Of course people</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed. He could feel change in him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. But not in most things. Tenaci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously he had clung to a determination</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show Luke Karsten that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh lightly, ride like a fool, and still</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a man in a man's world. The invisi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble thread that linked him to Grace</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like a chain Mr strength--had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been for three years. Only for that--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Molly Gray--he recalled her last</seg><seg type="columnLine">words. A man could interpret them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">various ways. Angel thrust that out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind. The feeling that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to prove himself set his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders back and his head up as he rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the LUK dooryard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Change here. Yes. Angel's keen eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted sagging barn doors and broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence panels. The LUK sat on a bald</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat. The dry fall wind blew Texas dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">in little swirls from under his horse's</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. The Trinity looked gray, shrunk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en, where he remembered it as spark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling like molten silver. A man, a tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin-faced man with a face like a good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natured eagle stood in the door of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunkhouse--Steve Murray. He said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Howdy stranger. Put up your horse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's high noon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steve did not know him. Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Angel tightened up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Luke Karsten home?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah, over in the house."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Gosh," Angel breathed, and rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fifty yards to the old ranch house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He swung down by the same three</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps. He doffed his hat in the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Old Luke gtood with his back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fireplace where a yellow flame</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flickered in a sooty cavern. The old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's bearded chin was sunk on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Luke," Angel greeted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I dunno's I can place you." Karsten</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at him a few seconds. "You look</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord, Lord!" Angel cried. "Have I</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped a few years like Rip Van</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winkle? I'm Angel Patmore, Luke."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Karsten walked aroimd him into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">better light. "Why, so it is," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Darned if it ain't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Last time you and me talked, right</seg><seg type="columnLine">here in this room," Angel reminded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you give me hell, Luke.

Old Luke nodded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You still sore at me because I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad an' tore into you?" Angel asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">diffidently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Karsten shook his head. A ghost of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smile flitted across his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'm back." Angel issued his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultimatum. "I come back for Grace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where is she? I sent her a wire from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah, she got it," old Luke rumbled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So you got cows of your own now?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A couple of thousand head," Angel</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him casually. "A ranch in Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tana. And cash in the bank. I ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">braggin', Luke. I'm just tellin' you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show you you were wrong about me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Karsten stared at the floor. "I reckon</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was," he said at last. And only Angel</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what a concession that was from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stubborn old cattleman who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known him since he was knee-high to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grasshopper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've done all right," Old Luke</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued.

I'm sorry, Angel."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angel Patmore stood for ten seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he had frozen in his tracks. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was taut, immobile, but his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not. He could see the whole se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quence like pictures flashing before</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes. Out of sight, out of mind. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">his struggle, his self-discipline, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">achievement, gone by the board. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more he had gambled and lost. Yet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not feel the pangs of a loser. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Why, he thought to himself, I ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be as mad as a hatter, or plumb</seg><seg type="columnLine">brokenhearted. Gosh darn it, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of a feller am I, anyhow?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aloud he said, "Well, it's a free coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try.

He looked out the window at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">miles of brown flatness, at a dust ban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner streaming where a rider fogged a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunch of horses toward the LUK cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rals. It was all over. There was not any</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting. He had come two thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles to draw a blank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's lookin' at you, Angel!" Kar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sten gulped his drink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's how, Luke!" Angel drained</seg><seg type="columnLine">his glass, put on his hat, turned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. "So long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two miles along the trail to Post</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oak Angel stopped to look back. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">whimsical noticri made him laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud. He took two silver dollars out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his trousers pocket and jingled</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in the palm of his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothin' but a gamblin' fool!

Angel suddenly felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vast sense of relief, a profound grati-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude, as if some weight had rolled off</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He did not quite know why. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">took him some time to get that figured</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.

All day long it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had raged at the corners of this snug,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stout house that Asa had built for her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">here in the lee of the Ute Creek bluffs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Listening to its baffled fury, she told</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself that never in the three years</seg><seg type="columnLine">since he had brought her to this new</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, a bride of eighteen, had there</seg><seg type="columnLine">been such a blizzard as this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having in mind these bad storms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">winter, Asa had built the house close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the foot of the bluffs. He often spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">of how protected they were; his words</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming back to her now made her</seg><seg type="columnLine">wince. If they were protected here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what must it be like out in the hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on the big flats where the full</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweep of the wind had play? A glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him, his shoulders hunched and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head lowered, throwing all his great</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength against the storm, fighting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">every foot he gained, filled her with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushing awareness of her complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">isolation; there'd be no fetching Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacGlashin tonight. In her mind's eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mina could see that mountain road to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ox-bow, choked with snow, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps long since blotted from sight. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">made her realize how foolish she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been to think of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Asa pulled down a generous quan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tity of hay for the horses. He had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">break the ice in the pails before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could water them. He cleaned out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalls then. The scouring snow had</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubbed his face red. Working, his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> breath steamed on the frosty air. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraping of the shovel, every sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the munching of the horses had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sharp, ringing clearness that comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">only with great cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went to the barn window when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had his chores finished. It was white</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hoar frost. Raising his sleeve, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubbed away the rime. Peering</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the cleared space, he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the near-by creek, where the snow had</seg><seg type="columnLine">piled up against the willow brakes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">great drifts, eight to ten feet high. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">steers were somewhere along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creeks, drifting with the storm. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew he was bound to lose some; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his concern for Mina, he was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly conscious of the plight of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A momentary eddying of the storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him a glimpse of the flats beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ute Creek. .There were brown spots</seg><seg type="columnLine">out there where the frozen, hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">packed earth was showing. The sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartened him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thinking aloud, he said, "A team</seg><seg type="columnLine">might get through. It'll be tough going,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it is a chance." And then, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitter self-reproach, "We should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">started an hour ago; there's no bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the doctor here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In such a storm, they might easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose their way. Death would be the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">evitable penalty; in all that first twen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty miles to Dutchman's Ford, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't so much as a sheep camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know the country too well to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost," he argued. "I'll find the ford all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. It's terrible asking Mina to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trip, but--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He broke off abruptly, struck by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden thought. There was a back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">country saloon at Dutchman's Ford; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon and nothing else. It bore an evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">reputation. But that was beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point; on a night like this Soapy Tap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">RAW LAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">109</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">per would have a big fire going. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">last time he had passed the place he</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that Soapy had it well banked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sod. It would be warm even to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. They could stop there for a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes and thaw themselves out. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew how Mina would feel about ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting foot in that saloon. But this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no time to be swayed by such</seg><seg type="columnLine">prejudices. He wondered why he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not thought of it beforp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made his decision instantly. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed a great responsibility on him</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he felt strangely relieved. Running</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the feedbox, he filled a battered pan</seg><seg type="columnLine">with oats for the team, spilling some</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his haste. He had not been grain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeding the horses of late; but they'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">need something to keep them warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight. He put the pole in the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">rig then and filled the wagon box with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hay. Over it he spread an old buffalo</seg><seg type="columnLine">robe, and over that a second robe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well tucked in, Mina would be warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough in the wagon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For himself, he placed a blanket on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seat; he could wrap it around his</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs. He put a shovel in the wagon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carrying the double harness into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stall, he tossed it on the team.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It did not take him long to hitch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The horses were long in hair. The wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluffed it and flattened out their manes</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they stood waiting while he closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barn door. With some urging, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got them started and drove up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. Habit was strong in him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he paused to knock the snow from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">boots before he stepped into the kitch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en. Mina sat at the table, the color all</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone from her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Mina, you've had another bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">spell," he said, anxiety tearing at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm all right now," she answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She raised her face and smiled; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked so grave and sorry, standing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there, as though he were responsible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her suffering. She laid her hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his cold cheek. "You mustn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be afraid, Asa. You've got to help me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be brave. Maybe the storm will blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself out before morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His heart was in his eyes as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed at her. "Mina, I've hitched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">team. I'm taking you to town. I've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">some hay and the robes in the wagon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll take some blankets from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. When we get to the ford, I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry you into Tapper's place until you</seg><seg type="columnLine">get warm."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mina stared at him aghast. Slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">she shook her head. "No, Asa-no! We</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't make it--and that saloon--in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my condition. Those men--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mina, we're going," he said, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice harsh with an authority he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never used to her before. "There's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Asa, please!" she insisted. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">brave of you to offer to take me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know you are thinking only of me. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've got to think of the baby."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm thinking of both of you. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">why we're going. You'll need, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. Tell me where they are and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll put them in a bag for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sounded so sure of himself. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't remember when he had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed her. It made her believe he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be right now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Very well," she murmured as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose, "we'll go." Suddenly her arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">went around his neck and she kissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him fondly. "I'll get the things," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I'll feel better if I walk a little."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Night fell suddenly soon after they</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the creek. But Asa had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bearings. He had the wind at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back now, and knew he could not go</seg><seg type="columnLine">far astray as long as he kept it there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The team had settled down to its task</seg><seg type="columnLine">110</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and moved along without much urging</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At long intervals he found traces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road. There was no keeping to it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Time after time the drifts forced him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to strike off across the flats. He spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mina; she said she was warm. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold was getting into his bones. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could stand it no longer, he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and trotted alongside the horses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once the team stopped and could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be urged forward. He went ahead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank in the snow to his armpits. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew this dry wash. It told him exact-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly where he was. Knowing he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hope to find a way across, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to quarter and swing far around it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It all took time. He could see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horses were tiring, and fully half</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distance yet to go. But the valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">was widening and the great force of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind was scouring the flats clean.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He got back on the wagon and used</seg><seg type="columnLine">his whip. For the better part of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, they made fairly good time. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitter cold was slashing at him, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't mind; Mina was warm and rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing easily, and they were getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. Nothing else mattered. A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes later the team balked at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drift. He got out his shovel and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead to dig a way through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back in the wagon, Mina pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">back the blankets and robes and raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">-Jierself on an elbow. She was in great</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain. Seeing they had stopped, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">called to Asa; but the wind wiped</seg><seg type="columnLine">away her pitiful cry before it reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears. The mad urge to get out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wagon and run and run until she</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell exhausted in the snow almost over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came her. But the spell passed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Asa put his shovel under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat, she lifted her head again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long have we been here?" she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, raising her voice to make her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self heard above the whooping of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had to work his jaws before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could answer. "Not long," he said, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">words all blurred with cold. "About</seg><seg type="columnLine">two, three miles more." With his mit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened hand he brushed the snow off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the robe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're freezing to death, Asa,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mina cried. "I wouldn't know your</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. Let me drive the team awhile;</seg><seg type="columnLine">you get under the robes and warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll make out," was all he said, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he trudged along beside the horses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told himself that no man had such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wife as he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Repeatedly he shouted at the horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slapped old Belle on the withers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to coax more speed out of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was to no avail; he knew the whip</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have no better effect. Bucking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drifts and wallowing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow that was belly-deep on the level</seg><seg type="columnLine">for miles had taken everything out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the animals. Knowing horses, he real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized that the team would never get</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to town. Every passing minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it plainer; indeed, the fear grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him that they might not even make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the wagon, wide awake, Mina lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened to every turning of the wheels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How slowly the horses move," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Asa walked all the time now, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanting to add his weight to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">team's load. It was all he could do to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drag himself along. If he needed any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to tell him how far gone he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came a few minutes later when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed his footing and sprawled full</seg><seg type="columnLine">length in the white smother. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first of many times that he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">RAW LAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">111</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He told himself that he should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing Soapy's light. With squinting</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes he tried to peer through the hiss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing flakes. He could see nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be right on top of it before I locate</seg><seg type="columnLine">it tonight," he muttered, brushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">away the fringe of ice on his brow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His thoughts did not go beyond Dutch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's Ford. He knew he might find</seg><seg type="columnLine">some horses there, but they would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle stock and not broken to harness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What they were going to do, he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. It seemed relatively unimpor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant compared to the driving necessity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reaching the ford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He wondered how cold it was. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow had an icy edge. He could hear it</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike his coat and drift off with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">abrasive rustle. He had seen this coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try show its fangs before, and it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not made him love it any the less. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">loyalty to it did not waver now, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw it for the harsh land it was. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right with me, he thought, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't have any right to ask Mina to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The team had stopped. Old Belle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffing and snorting. Asa did not urge</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on. He knew it was time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe them again. Throwing an arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the mare, he huddled against her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to draw what warmth he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Surely Tapper's saloon could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">much farther. The crucifying thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he might have missed the ford</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to him. But he knew better than</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. All along here the South Fork</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottoms were choked with willow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrub; it would turn him back until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he finally found the ford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no sound from the wagon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surely the Lord was looking out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mina tonight. He bowed his head hum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bly, thinking how helpless a man could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be at times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With an effort, he roused himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shouted at the team. The horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused even to raise their drooping</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads. Making his way around in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, he caught them by the curb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chains and tried to break them out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He met with their uncompromising</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore-legged resistance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It puzzled Asa. Remembering his ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience at the dry wash, he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back on the team and began to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigate. He had gone only a few feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">when something loomed darkly before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Another step, and he knew what</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was. To make sure, he moved off to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right a yard or two. There, blink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at him through the snow, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">buttery daub of light; this wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall was the rear end of Soapy Tap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per's horse shed. Trying to run, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his way back to the team.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mina, we're here," he told her;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"we're at the ford-."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She caught his excitement and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint note of pride in his blurred voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had a right to be proud, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, for he had accomplished what</seg><seg type="columnLine">few men could have done. Even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">those bright blades of pain were slash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at her again, she smiled at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll have you inside in just a min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute," he promised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She watched him as he struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the horses and finally got them</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the shed. The animals seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely able to drag one leg after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. Asa was no better off. Panic</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized her momentarily as she realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">their situation. She sat up in the wag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, hardly aware that they were out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind and snow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Asa--" she cried. "Asa, we can't go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. Look at you! You are half dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">with cold!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be all right as soon as I get</seg><seg type="columnLine">thawed out," he assured her. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">112</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">worry about me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the team--there's no going on</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them," she insisted. "You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're in pretty bad shape." It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grudging admission. "There's horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, but they're just cow ponies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'd never go to harness." He shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head hopelessly. "I've been putting</seg><seg type="columnLine">this moment off for a long time. I--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know what we're going to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You could borrow a pony--when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are warm, Asa." The suggestion</seg><seg type="columnLine">was born of desperation, but her tone</seg><seg type="columnLine">was steady as she voiced it. He stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her amazed as comprehension came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And leave you here, you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. If you could bring the doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Mina, no!" he cried. "You don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what you're saying. Our baby</seg><seg type="columnLine">born in a saloon!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What difference can it make? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">can it matter?" The fortitude of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">pioneer forbears was speaking now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"After all, this is still a wild land--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damn this land!" he muttered. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, you love it, Asa; and so do I,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said. "Some day it will be a fine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich land; and some of it will belong</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us. Our baby will be proud of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You ask Soapy Tapper if you can bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Asa Colcord thought he knew this</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman who bore his name, but as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled up to Soapy's door, he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself he would never know her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hands were too cold to turn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knob, but it was flung open, in answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his banging. A white, ghostly figure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stumbled into the barroom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood there swaying dizzily, the heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this room making his senses reel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">With fogged eyes, he saw Soapy,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">obese, heavy-featured, standing be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind his bar. Two men had a foot on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bar rail. Asa knew yiem: Stuffy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andrews, who rode for the big 7</seg><seg type="columnLine">Square outfit, and young Grat Spane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rough, tough puncher with an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruly shock of red hair. In the year that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed since he drifted into this</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, Grat had had many jobs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck to none. If he had caught on</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere for the wihter, Asa could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not name the spread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A third man had opened the door. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was old, watery-eyed Bitter Creek Cas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidy. He owned a little range on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">headwaters of the South Fork.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These men, evidently trapped here</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the storm, had settled down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the best of it. Now, their conver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation abruptly arrested, they froze in</seg><seg type="columnLine">grotesque attitudes and stared at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with unbelieving eyes. Soapy was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">less confounded. His hooded gaze sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly wide and incredulous, he leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, his bulbous stomach draped</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the bar, and sucked in his breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">noisily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, it's Asa Colcord--or what's</seg><seg type="columnLine">left of him!" he cried. "Man, yo're</seg><seg type="columnLine">about done for. Here--" he grabbed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass and a bottle of rye--"git a shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this into yuh in a hurry. Yuh need</seg><seg type="columnLine">a drink if ever a gent did. Where yuh</seg><seg type="columnLine">from, anyhow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ute Creek," Asa mumbled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stuffy Andrews got a chair from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">card table and tried to slide it under</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as he saw him sway. Asa steadied</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself against it but he did not sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All the way from Ute Creek on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">night like this?" Soapy demanded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You must be mad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"My wife--she's going to have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby," said Asa. "I'm taking her to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor. She--she's outside in the wag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">RAW LAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">113</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on. I'd like to bring her in, if I can.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She--she hasn't long to go. I hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what to do. My team is all stove</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. If I coidd leave my wife here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">borrow a horse, I--I could bring Doc</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mighels back with me--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A baby?" Soapy gulped. "A baby--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">His loosely-hinged mouth fell open</seg><seg type="columnLine">and something akin to terror froze on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his crude face. The others were equal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly aghast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You mean the baby will be born</seg><seg type="columnLine">here?" Stuffy Andrews gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grat Spane flashed a glance at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door as though considering bolting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place at once. Old Bitter Creek was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervously shifting from one foot to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. Reading the look in their eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asa realized the enormity of what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was asking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be damned!" Soapy groaned. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">men went, he didn't amount to much.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There had been talk about him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">always to his discredit, rumor once</seg><seg type="columnLine">having it that keeping this saloon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a cover for his real business. Asa</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of these things now and knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should have considered them be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore speaking. And yet, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soapy suddenly glaring fiercely at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others and saying, "Well, why not?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why can't Miz Colcord have her baby</seg><seg type="columnLine">here? Will yuh tell me what yo're</seg><seg type="columnLine">waitin' for? Yuh bring her in here at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once; and yuh be mighty gentle with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Well?" he roared as they hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">back for a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That angry bellow had the desired</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect. The men shuffled out and Soapy</seg><seg type="columnLine">came around from the end of the bar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He poured some whisky into the empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass and made Asa down it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yuh git them frozen things off," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanded, "and stay away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stove till yuh thaw out. I'll shake up</seg><seg type="columnLine">my bed a little. Shame to ask a woman</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to use it--ain't got no sheets or</seg><seg type="columnLine">nuthin'--but it's the best there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Asa tried to murmur his thanks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soapy growled him to silence. "Ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">nuthin' to be thankin' me for," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We'll stretch a rope across the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hang up a couple of blankets, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">yore wife will have the back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon to herself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The men brought Mina in. Bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Creek helped Soapy string up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankets. From where he sat, Asa</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at them dully. He wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">help; he wanted to go to Mina; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a lethargy on him that kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushing him deeper and deeper into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His frost-bitten face was beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to burn. He knew that rubbing a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow into it every few minutes would</seg><seg type="columnLine">help. Even that was beyond him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Stuffy Andrews went out again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he returned, he said, "I put up</seg><seg type="columnLine">your team."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It roused Asa. What was he thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of, sitting here like this? He had to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to town. He had to borrow a pony.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly he dragged himself to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said, "I'll have to ask one of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to loan me a horse. I've got to be go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Something touched Grat Spane's</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank, inscrutable face briefly and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. He said, "My bronc's in the shed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But you're all in. You better stay here</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Miz Colcord. I'll go fetch Doc</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mighels."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Asa was surprised and touched--</seg><seg type="columnLine">having faced the storm for five hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could appreciate w hat Grat was of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fering--but he could not rub out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes his reluctance to put the fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mina and the baby in Spane's hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By every tale he had heard of him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shiftless and unreliable. Looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">114</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for a man you could trust in an emer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gency, you would not have picked Grat</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grat pretended not to notice, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">read that reservation in Asa's mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The kid's right," Soapy spoke up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had finished hanging the blankets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">''He's young and tough as bullhide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yuh'd never make it yoreself, Col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord." He turned to Stuffy. "Yuh let</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grat take yore hair chaps.

"You won't fail</seg><seg type="columnLine">me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll fetch him as I said," Grat an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soapy poured him out a drink before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he left. "Git this inside yuh and be on</seg><seg type="columnLine">yore way," he ordered. Grat dashed off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the liquor and hurried out. Soapy put</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottle on the back bar, signifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his establishment was closed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Bitter Creek insisted that snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">water was better than snow itself for</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing the sting out of frost bite. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked over Asa until the pain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yo're shore lookin' better," Soapy</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I'm coming around all right,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asa agreed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went back to sit beside Mina.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She reached out and caught his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Asa, these men have been very kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us," she murmured softly. "We must</seg><seg type="columnLine">never forget."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He squeezed her fingers affection-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately and said nothing. A few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, she had another bad spell. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were coming oftener now. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would. He prayed that Grat</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be back with the doctor in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the front of the barroom, Soapy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bitter Creek, and Stuffy Andrews sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the card table, a strange silence on</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Had there been any place they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could go, Stuffy and Bitter Creek</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have gone. But they were pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oners too. At Soapy's suggestion, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried playing cards. It soon palled on</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Soapy got up and turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamps low.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Never thought about the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">gittin' in her eyes," he explained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bitter Creek built up the fire, mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing back and forth on tiptoe, so as not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make any noise, and being rewarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a smothered curse from Stuffy</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he closed the stove door with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint bang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soapy wound his watch at midnight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grat had been gone barely an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be some time before he gets back,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stuffy murmured guardedly.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">winced every time she groaned. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciously, they were trying to bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">her agony.

He shook his head. "Makes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The others nodded and said nothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they were humbled too. And far</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on the flat lands Grat Spane rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">with head lowered against the storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and roundly damned himself for hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing been so ready with his offer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many times he pulled his stumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">pony out of the drifts. The blizzard</seg><seg type="columnLine">was really beginning to howl. At first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been contemptuous of its sting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, already a man of parts, he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it was to come to grips with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">RAW LAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">115</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">northers on the Llano and the knifing</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold of the poganip on Nevada's high</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserts. He had been taking this storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously enough for the past hour. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew a man didn't want to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake tonight. It made him a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more careful not to miss the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand of aspens at Iron Point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There, out of the wind, he managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to build three fires. He got in between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, turning round and round until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was warmed through. He still had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long swing around Ruby Mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of him. It wouldn't be easy, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew he'd make town now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was long after midnight when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalked into the hotel barroom where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doc Mighels sat playing poker.

Never glancing back, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soapy insisted on holding the baby.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mina gazed at him and saw through</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his worthlessness and found some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yo're sure somethin' to be proud</seg><seg type="columnLine">of, young feller," Soapy declared ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miringly.

Mina saw his chin quiver</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knew that memory was reaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">back across the years to something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clean and good. Then suddenly, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though frightened at what he beheld,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soapy laughed nervously. "Shucks!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he exclaimed. "Men is what this coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try needs.

Mina, occupied with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy, was only remotely aware of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it until in the dusk of one evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">early in May, Fred Isbell, of the 7</seg><seg type="columnLine">Square, rode into the yard as they sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">at supper. He spoke to her through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window and asked Asa to step outside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising his voice against the barking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the new pup which they had recent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly acquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something in Fred Isbell's flat, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressionless face told her that he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not come on pleasant business. Asa</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined him, bidding the dog be quiet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They spoke for a few moments. Mina</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught Asa's shocked "No! You don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">say! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can't be mistaken," Isbell an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered. "We mean to put an end to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time." They talked on for a while.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leaving, Isbell said loud enough for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to hear, "You be at my place before</seg><seg type="columnLine">daybreak, Colcord." Asa nodded, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man rode away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although he had not finished his cof-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fee, Asa went down to the corral be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the barn instead of returning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house. He stayed there a long time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his foot on the corral gate. He might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been watching tihe new colt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been foaled this morning. Mina</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought differently, and when he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the house, she had to put a</seg><seg type="columnLine">question to him to elicit any informa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rustling again," he told her. "Isbell</seg><seg type="columnLine">says everybody is organized this time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm to be at his place before sunup."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She saw his mouth tighten. "I wish I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't have to go." And then, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting her gaze, he added lamely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's so much to do right now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not deceive Mina. She busied</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself with the dishes, not wanting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to embarrass him. "I know how busy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you are," she said. Believing she knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was troubling him, it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy for her to hold her voice steady.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But rustling has to be put down. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to be the only way to do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The matter ended there, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were careful not to refer to it again. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed a restraint on them that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening long.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Asa finally knocked the ashes from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pipe and went to bed. At two in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning, she heard him out in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen, making himself a cup of cof-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fee. Later, he let himself out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, and, in a few minutes, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard him riding away. It was the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he had ever left without kissing</seg><seg type="columnLine">her good-by. Plainer than words, it told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her what impended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning dragged along. Out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yard, Ring, the dog, barked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled by turns at the end of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chain. Half a dozen times Mina came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the door and bade him be quiet. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon, Fred Isbell and four others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stuffy Andrews among them, rode up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the house. Isbell's manner was grim</seg><seg type="columnLine">and uncompromising; but he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in Mina's eyes that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him reframe the question he had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mrs. Colcord," he said, markedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasy, "you haven't seen anything of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grat Spane over this way today, have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Though Mina heard him without</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise, she felt her blood go cold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fred Isbell had told her only what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already surmised. "No," she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I haven't seen anyone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man nodded, but was not con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced. Mina could feel him weighing</seg><seg type="columnLine">her answer. He said, "He can't be far;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's wounded some. His trail was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain as day to Mud Springs. When we</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost it, he was headin' for Ute Creek."</seg><seg type="columnLine">RAW LAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">117</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's very likely gone down the can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yon," said Mina, a slow fury beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to burn in her. "I couldn't imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">him coming this way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fred Isbell did not say what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given him the idea; but Mina knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was in his mind, and it did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">need the cooing of her baby, awake in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his crib, to tell her. Their eyes met and</seg><seg type="columnLine">something ran between them that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made Isbell flush darkly under his tan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are free to search the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">and barn," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he protested hurriedly. "Sorry</seg><seg type="columnLine">we bothered you, Mrs. Colcord. We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">whip out the canyon. We made sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Bitter Creek won't do any more</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustling; and we're going to be just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure about Spane." He started to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">his horse. "If your husband and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others come looking for us, tell them</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is my husband?" Mina asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"MacGlashin, your husband, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite a bunch pulled away from us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">round up Soapy Tapper," he informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. "It shouldn't take them long." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his hand to his companions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they rode away at a driving gallop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still burning with indignation, Mina</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched until they were only puffs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust in the distance. Suddenly they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gone altogether. She felt as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did about rustling, but it did not keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">her from hoping that Grat Spane</seg><seg type="columnLine">would win free. Thought of him, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">young and his life forfeited to his fool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishness, filled her with nausea. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">served her well, and not counted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost to himself. Soapy had been kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her too; but she had an entirely dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent feeling about him. She pitied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soapy and Bitter Creek, though she</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that the pattern of their lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made the end that had overtaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">them well nigh inevitable. Once, there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been some excuse for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them; some hope that they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">change their ways. That time had long</seg><seg type="columnLine">since passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She couldn't believe it was quite that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way with Grat Spane--at least not yet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She knew the good and the bad in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man were often sadly scrambled; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes it needed only a push in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right direction to enable him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find himself. Feeling as she did, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered what she would have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it been in her power to help Grat</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," she murmured so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berly. "I perhaps would have done the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Weary of the dog's barking, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">freed it, and straightaway it raced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barn door and raised its voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">louder than ever. "Ring, you come here</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once!" she called. "Whatever has</seg><seg type="columnLine">got in--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stopped abruptly, struck by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that the barn door was closed.^For</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, indeed ever since the weather</seg><seg type="columnLine">had turned mild, it had stood open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The closed door, the frantic dog--un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstanding came to her quickly. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks tightly drawn, she walked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barn with long, clean strides. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to put her shoulder to the door to</seg><seg type="columnLine">force it back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quite simply, she said, "Grat, if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are hiding up there in the hay, come</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the silence that followed, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of the pounding of her heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She knew he was here and that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already decided what she was go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to do with him. A moment later, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustling in the hay rewarded her. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">board creaked above, and then a pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of overall-clad legs appeared on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladder. When Grat finally stood before</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, she saw that all the swagger and</seg><seg type="columnLine">118</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bluster had gone from him. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found some old rags in the barn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to bandage his wounded arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With one foot clawing the other and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking the picture of dejection, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "I don't care what you do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, Miz Colcord. You can turn me over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the posse if you want to. I jest want</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to know I didn't come here 'cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">I figgered you owed me anythin'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mina felt her throat tighten. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of that, Grat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My bronc folded up on me," he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained. "I knew I couldn't make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyon--so I came here. I--I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought how it might look." He tugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his hat nervously and looked away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes bleak and bitter with self-re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proach. "I know I don't amount to</seg><seg type="columnLine">anythin', but there is some things I</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw the line at," he muttered with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace of pride.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I were you, I wouldn't be so</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick to admit to myself that I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount to anything," Mina reproved</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "That may be what is at the bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom of your trouble. You get yourself</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the house now, and be quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Never having dressed a gunshot</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound, it took her twice as long as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have. The only antiseptic she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had was a bottle of creosote dip that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asa used on the stock. It had tongues</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fire that made Grat Spane grit his</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your arm will be all right," she told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, pausing at the window to scan</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flats. She knew that Asa and Myles</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacGlashin and the others riding with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them must be coming soon. It warned</seg><seg type="columnLine">her that she had no time to lose. "A</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse wearing a Cross T brand drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in here this spring," she told him. "No</seg><seg type="columnLine">one ever came to claim it. I'll saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">it for you, and you can go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grat swallowed hard. "Miz Colcord,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you shouldn't be doin' all this for me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he protested huskily. Mina turned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him very sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe you are right," she said flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. "Maybe it is a waste of time to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to help you. If you are determined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be hanged for a rustler, it doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">make much difference whether you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanged here or over in Wild River.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that's what it will get to, Grat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless you change your ways. Just get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting to a new country won't help you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes'm," he muttered, as miserable</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though he were actually about to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked to eternity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know you got off to a bad start,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mina continued. "So have a good many</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. Those who changed their ways</seg><seg type="columnLine">are here today, respected." Her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were level and unafraid as she gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him. "You can amount to something</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you'll only have half as much faith</seg><seg type="columnLine">in yourself as I have in you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Opening the door, she told him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait there until she returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was only a matter of minutes be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore she was back with the saddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse. About to ride away, he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at her, and Mina saw something</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eyes that said she had not made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mistake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you worry about me, Miz</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colcord," he advised haltingly. "No</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason why you should believe me, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm goin' to try to amount to some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mina smiled at him. "I believe you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grat," she murmured, her eyes begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning to mist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Late that afternoon, riding home</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone across the flatlands, Asa encoun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered Doc Mighels.

They got</seg><seg type="columnLine">more'n you have, Aaron."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over by the stove a large man sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly rose from his chair and lurched</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the group at the bar. A glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was enough to show that he was under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the influence of liquor, though it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only ten o'clock in the morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aaron Rose's lips tightened as, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clear lower portion of the back-bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror, he saw and recognized him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a man as large as the rancher</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. He possessed a great pyra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">midal head,, topped off by a shock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy black hair. He wore a canvas</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat, corduroy trousers, and heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramping-boots. This man was Cyrus</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurley, the rancher's enemy for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past two years. Hurley was the local</seg><seg type="columnLine">zanjero for the water company that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rose was suing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A zanjero, it may be necessary to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain, is a man who has charge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distribution of water among the vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous ranches that are supplied by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">irrigation system. Before he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought his ranch, Aaron Rose had</seg><seg type="columnLine">served as zanjero in this water district.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurley had been his chief assistant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had. quarreled over Hurley's per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petual drinking, which rendered him</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfit for his work; also Rose had sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected him of giving certain ranchers</seg><seg type="columnLine">more water than they paid the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany for, thereby pocketing small tips</seg><seg type="columnLine">for himself. Rose had not discharged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him because of his family, but let him</seg><seg type="columnLine">off repeatedly with warnings. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rose, having saved his money, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought the Rose Ranch, titled by him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self because of his name and the count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less roses that he grew wherever they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could thrive best. And, to the surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the neighborhood, Cyrus Hurley</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had been appointed zanjero in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead. And Cyrus, in a spiteful spirit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done a great deal of injury to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aaron Rose since the days when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">both had been working together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he reached the bar he sidled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the rancher and leered at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">wickedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll tell the world," he said rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickly, "that ye was a fool, Rose. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ye beat from the start. You poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">fish, ye don't know that it was me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">kep' ye from gettin' yer perm'nt in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">junction, do ye? Ye don't savvy that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was me that worked on the chief engi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neer and made him believe it was best</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run that canal across your poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece o' land instead of Cummings's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">do ye? And/d'ye savvy why? I done it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get even with ye f'r many a dirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">little deal ye handed me when ye was</seg><seg type="columnLine">zanjero. That's what I done, ye poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">fish!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rose laughed shortly after a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two of silence. "Good imagination</seg><seg type="columnLine">you got, Cy," he said, winking at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bartender. "Don't try that stuff on me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Aaron Rose was not as sure as</seg><seg type="columnLine">before that his destination would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Chapter Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aaron Gets An Idea</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAT evening Aaron</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Rose sat in his ranch</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">house, brooding over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the events of the day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The early California</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">evening was cool</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and brisk. He looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through the window</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at his beautiful acres, and sighed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deeply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Pasture lands were turning green be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore him, and the smell of early flowers</seg><seg type="columnLine">ENCHANTED RANCH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">floated in through the open window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here and there over these pasture</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands were groves of gigantic oaks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beyond was a forest of spruce and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sugar pines. There were patches of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaparral that Rose had refused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eliminate because of their wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">color under the changing light of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun. Red cattle nibbled at the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass. There were sheep, of a fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">breed, herded into a corral for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. His horses rubbed their noses</seg><seg type="columnLine">against rail fences or bit playfully at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another. It made a scene that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aaron Rose loved, but, in his mind, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was marred by the irrigating canal</seg><seg type="columnLine">that crossed it from end to end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deeply he brooded over his difficul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties. He had been brooding over them</seg><seg type="columnLine">.entirely too much of late. Obstinately</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had refused to use one pint of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water that flowed gurglingly through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his picturesque ranch. Matters were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so bad as he allowed himself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine. The Rose Ranch, a dry ranch</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the lateral had been constructed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been under irrigation now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but for the stubbornness of its owner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His land had doubled, nay, trebled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">value since the water crossed it, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not see it thus. Aaron Rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pretty much of a dreamer, and, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">reality, cared little for this world's</seg><seg type="columnLine">goods. He wanted peace and plenty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the joys of the big outdoors--little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. He loved his stock and his work</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than the returns they brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Hence his bitterness toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big water company, who cared not for</seg><seg type="columnLine">scenery but dividends, which they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not need.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so his old enemy, Cyrus Hurley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this big company's engineer were</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the bottom of his defeat. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">court had been with them, for Aaron's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawyer had, at the preliminary hear-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, pointed out that the ditch might</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as well cross Cummings's prop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erty as the Rose Ranch. On this show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing they had got their temporary in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">junction, pending final action by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">court. But in the meantime the dirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">work had been done, and at the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing a permanent injunction had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been denied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, he'd fix them yet! He was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">without ideas. That morning he really</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had it in mind to stop the useless</seg><seg type="columnLine">controversy, for he had reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusion that the jury had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">"fixed." He really had intended to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to New York for a short time, to forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire matter. Now, however, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no intention of going to New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York. But he was glad that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread the news of his intended trip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was glad, too, that he had spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the big supply of provisions he</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant to lay in for Oswald Jacks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">use during his absence. No, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not go to New York, but he would go</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere. And the supply of provi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions that he would buy would startle</seg><seg type="columnLine">the groceryman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He left his chair and went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall telephone. He called up Jacks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him to report for duty in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. Then he went to bed, feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cyrus Hurley had given him a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea. He would make them pay dam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages for the great trees that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaned to the ground on the Rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ranch. They'd pay dearly, too. No man</seg><seg type="columnLine">could beat Aaron Rose out of his rights</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get away with it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, manlike, Aaron Rose had fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ured without the girl. Someone has</seg><seg type="columnLine">facetiously said that it is a noble thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a man to'devote his life to man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind, but that it is nobler still, and far</seg><seg type="columnLine">more interesting, for him to devote it</seg><seg type="columnLine">124</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to womankind. Aaron Rose had no girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work for--no girl to show him his</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolish stubbornness. But a little boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">who wears no clothes, and carries a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiver filled with arrows and a bow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at that very moment chuckling</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his sleeveless wrist at Aaron</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         Chapter Three</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         Grapevine Creek</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">.VING thus decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that what ailed Aaron</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rose was too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aaron Rose, Cupid</seg><seg type="columnLine">had looked about for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl and found her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He found her rid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down Grapevine</seg><seg type="columnLine">Creek, some twelve miles from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rose Ranch, in a big wagon, squeezed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in between two men. She was a pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, and her hair was dark and wavy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there came a dimple in each cheek</seg><seg type="columnLine">every time she even thought there</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be occasion for a smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The road down Grapevine Creek was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so old that no one in that country</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have told, if asked, when it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been built. The district through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wagon groaned its weary way was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an abandoned district, and for years</seg><seg type="columnLine">and years the road had not heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring of pick or the scrape of a shovel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grapevine Creek itself had tended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road. In a thousand places it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed over it and uncovered boulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had once been hidden by the hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">of man, or piled up snarls of driftwood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also its moistness had festooned grape-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vines overhead like the tangled hair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mad woman. Over the drifts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulders the wagon rocked up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, the four-horse team plowing its</seg><seg type="columnLine">way through the grapevine entangle-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, the riders bending forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plucking at the vines, tearing them</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from their throats, expecting ev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery moment to be hung by the neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they were dead, dead, dead. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind them a large load of household</seg><seg type="columnLine">goods swayed from side to side, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">any moment the riders expected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire mass to pitch off into the creek</seg><seg type="columnLine">or against the bank on the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. The pretty girl rode between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver and her brother lest she be like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise lifted from her perch and hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">into oblivion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her name was Diantha Stanley. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother's name was Duncan Stanley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The name of the driver does not mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, since he was hired only for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one trip, and was nursing a terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">grouch because he had not had the '</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense to refuse when Diantha looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him so reproachfully with her big</seg><seg type="columnLine">black eyes. He knew the road down</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grapevine Creek of old. For years no</seg><seg type="columnLine">teamster had attempted it. Yet here he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, praying only that his reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">would hold out to the end of the silly</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About a mile beyond the point where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the travelers were struggling onward</seg><seg type="columnLine">there lay a tiny valley in the cup of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hills. Here Grapevine Creek swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">in toward the steep hills on the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, so that it did not break the tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">level spot and divide it in half. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood an old tumbledown cabin, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this cabin was the goal of the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">who fought their way down the creek</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, if one were to walk from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaky and ancient cabin, pass over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little flat, so green and tempting to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexperienced agriculturalist, cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grapevine Creek, and climb through</seg><seg type="columnLine">alders, bays, and oaks a way, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come upon a dense patch of chaparral.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ENCHANTED RANCH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">125</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">This great patch extended for miles',</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost to the outskirts of Campbell's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flat, the county seat. It was what is</seg><seg type="columnLine">known in the West as locked chap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arral. Its branches were so intertwined</seg><seg type="columnLine">that nothing larger than a bird could</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass through the thicket.

Also, there were canvas bags,</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with water from Grapevine</seg><seg type="columnLine">Creek.

In that day, no doubt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ditch had extended through heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">forests. Through the forests, cattle had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandered in later years and trampled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the old ditch until scarcely a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestige of it remained. Then the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire had swept the country, and chap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arral had grown up where the forest</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stood. So the ditch was forgotten,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greater part of it hidden away in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dense chaparral.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in following the contours of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills, the diggers of the ditch had oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casionally found it necessary to tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel. And the cave that Aaron had</seg><seg type="columnLine">chosen as his secret rendezvous was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of these tunnels, through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocky brow of a hill. For years, both</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends had been closed by the shattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirt and eroding rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In trailing a wounded mountain lion</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the chaparral one day, the loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirt had given way under Aaron's feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the secret tunnel was exposed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the time Aaron had thought what</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wonderful hiding-place this unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel, still closed at one end, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make for a man who wished to hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his fellows. But then it had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred to him that he ever would</seg><seg type="columnLine">want it for that purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now that he did want it, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found that a little work was all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was -required to clear the mouth en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely, and this he did the first morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">after he had dragged his goods to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel's mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now everything was in readi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness for his lengthy stay here in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaparral, while his acquaintances be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved that he was in New York City.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had a few books and magazines.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would not be very lonely.

He noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the girl did most of the work, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this he frowned. Often he heard her</seg><seg type="columnLine">singing, and her clear contralto notes</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted up the hillside in pleasing melo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dies. Aaron liked to hear a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">sing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was indeed a busy little body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">always doing something with sleeves</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled above her elbows, and doing it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a snap and preciseness that ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pealed to him. Every time he saw her</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying two buckets of water from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spring, he ground his teeth. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth did her husband mean by al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing her to do that heavy work? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the cabin most of the time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the girl was almost continually</seg><seg type="columnLine">at tasks outside. He was a good-for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing loafer, Rose decided, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed to give him a piece of his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And what on earth were they doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, anyway? Were they just camp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out? No, everything pointed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">belief that they had come to stay. Were</seg><seg type="columnLine">they crazy? Did they expect to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">living on those rocky forty acres, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creek bed dry as a bone by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of June?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">About ten days had passed after</seg><seg type="columnLine">their coming when, early one morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, Aaron saw the two walk hand in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand up the canyon. They were away</seg><seg type="columnLine">so long that he decided to go down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and investigate, but shrank from such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing instinctively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They returned shortly before dusk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">proudly driving an old bay horse that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aaron instantly recognized. It be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed, or had belonged, provided it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had now changed hands, to a rancher</seg><seg type="columnLine">who lived at the upper end of Grape-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vine Creek. It was twenty-three years</seg><seg type="columnLine">old if it was a day--an old mare that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had at one time been a three-minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">trotter. If they had paid over ten dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars for the mare they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">stung. Behind the still proud old ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal bumped a dilapidated buggy. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the buggy, when the outfit halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the cabin, the owners took sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry articles, among them a small plow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy harness, and one section of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">harrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great guns! They're going to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to farm!" Aaron groaned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The unhitching of the mare took fif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen minutes, both at work. She grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatient and nipped at the girl. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">retaliation the girl shook a reproving</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger in her face and fondled her</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck. They unbuckled every buckle in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight, Aaron thought, and it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a harness maker to put the har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness together again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at last the old crowbait was free</seg><seg type="columnLine">of leather, whereupon she lifted her</seg><seg type="columnLine">still youthful heels, lammed out a cou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple of wavy kicks to right and left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and trotted magnificently on to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat, to bury her graying muzzle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">long teeth in the ankle-deep grass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're going to try and plow with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that old speed horse!" Aaron groaned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She's still good for a quarter of a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a three-thirty clip! Lord! Won't the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirt fly! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next morning the fun began. At an</seg><seg type="columnLine">early hour the man, proving by every</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement he made that what he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">about horses would fill many volumes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">led old Knock 'Em Dead--which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mare's name--down to the flat. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl followed, the center of a set of</seg><seg type="columnLine">single work harness. They left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mare grazing and went back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ENCHANTED RANCH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">129</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin, returning with the small plow</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never occurred to 'em to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mare drag it down," chuckled Aaron.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is gonta be good--if nobody gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now they packed the harrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the mare was harnessed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plow--a feat that had required nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">half an hour--there arose a lengthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussion down below as to ways and</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of starting the agricultural</seg><seg type="columnLine">project. But at last it seemed to be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided that they would begin operations</seg><seg type="columnLine">just below the cabin, plow lengthwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the flat, and end up at the creekside</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the work was done. At once the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl established herself between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">handles of the plow, and the man took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lines and began swaying them up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down as a signal to Knock 'Em</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dead that they were all set. Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his telescope Aaron noted the stern</seg><seg type="columnLine">look of determination on the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">each. "Get up! Get up!" floated up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hillside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately Knock 'Em Dead got</seg><seg type="columnLine">up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She gave a leap that stiffened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tugs, jerked the girl forward--all but</seg><seg type="columnLine">her feet--and started the man to trot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting. Another leap and the handles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plow left the girl's hands. She fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat on her face in the grass. The plow</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned sidewise and went skidding</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the turf, while the mare and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver went trotting rather gracefully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the lines stiff between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl sprang nimbly to her feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and began waving her hands after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">departing pair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell her whoa! Tell her whoa!" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted shrilly. "I fell down!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The driver had not noticed this at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. He was too busy watching the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mare to see that the girl was not trot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting along with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Whoa!" he responded. "Whoa!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pull on the lines!" screamed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl.

While she loved to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go, and possessed an abominably hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, she was an amenable old crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture; and as the driver added more</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight on the reins and continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">call "Whoa!" she responded, slowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, and stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Running, the girl rejoined the group.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another lengthy discussion took place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The result was that Knock 'Em Dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the plow were turned in a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle that half covered the diameter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the flat, and returned to the start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-post again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more the point of the plow was</seg><seg type="columnLine">inserted in the ground, and the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood between the handles, her cheeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">aglow, her eyes wide and expectant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get up!" floated up the hillside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And away they went again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time, however, the farmerette</seg><seg type="columnLine">was prepared.

At a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">clip they started down the flat. Imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately the plow point came out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil like a trout leaping for a fly. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">running girl lifted the handles, as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably had been told to do, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plow point dived for the bowels of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately the traces went taut.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Knock 'Em Dead stopped, leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, stopped, leaped, stopped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">130</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shook her head angrily--and then be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to stamp a nervous foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get up!

She knew noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing whatever about that kind. If it re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused to move with the ordinary pull</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she had been accustomed to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">for many years, then it could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved at all.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">snorted, kicked up her heels, raced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other end of the fiat, and buried</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her nose in the grass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">With slow movements the man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl dragged the plow to the higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, threw the harness upon it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Five minutes later the girl had start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to turn over the soil of the flat with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spading fork.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aaron pulled his hair.

There, hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den from the cabin by fragrant bays</seg><seg type="columnLine">and alders, he slipped down the creek</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had put many miles between him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the John Wharton Place before</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          Chapter Six</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          The Magician</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the light of Oswald Jacks to vanish</seg><seg type="columnLine">any moment. But he had to wait an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour before this occurred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He allowed Oz half an hour to drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sleep. Ten seconds probably would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been sufficient, but Aaron was</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking no chances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of that time he arose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked toward the lower corral below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big red barn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here he entered a shed in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">odds and ends were kept. He lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">matches and finally discovered what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sought--an old lead rope. Oz would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not miss it, for he was not yet familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the equipment of the ranch. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next thing that he appropriated was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas plow collar, one that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast aside as having seen its day. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">dared not go to the stable and get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">collar now in use for the horse he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mind. Oz Jacks was plowing, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">these days, and that collar would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed. The one on the John Wharton</seg><seg type="columnLine">Place, he knew, would not fit the enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous column of one of his precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clydes if it fit the scrawny neck of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knock 'Em Dead. But this old collar</seg><seg type="columnLine">would answer for a short piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. Then he found a sack and filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with rolled barley at the barn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the barley on his shoulder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other articles in hand, he walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the Live Oak pasture, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was called, and brought soft, suspi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious snorts from his grazing herd of</seg><seg type="columnLine">work animals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice was sufficient to allay</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fears. Aaron loved his horses, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Clydesdales loved Aaron. In a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">short time the old collar was about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck of Omar Khayyam, the lead rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">looped in his mouth as a bit, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sack of barley over his withers. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aaron leaped to the broad, slick back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whereupon Omar started obediently</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">still gleamed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ARON ROSE lay close</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to the odious canal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that crossed his prop-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> erty and had cost him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> so much money and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> W'orriment.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rider turned him, and they trotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponderously to the far end of the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. Here Aaron dismounted, delib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erately tore down his own rail fence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and led Omar through the gap. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode away, leaving the fence as it was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The chances were ten to one that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of the animals would not find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gap, and they were ten to one, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, if they did find it, it never could</seg><seg type="columnLine">occur to them to wander through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Such is the domestication of the pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tient, home-loving Clyde.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Oz Jacks, when he found Omar</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing and saw the gap, would imag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ine that the horse was not true to</seg><seg type="columnLine">breed, or had lost his senses when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandered away from his friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Omar's trot was a crime, but Aaron</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept him to it. Long before morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">they entered Grapevine Canyon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled up it over the stones. Half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile below the old John Wharton</seg><seg type="columnLine">Place, Aaron dismounted, tied Omar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tree, deposited the barley close at</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and went back to crawl to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave in the chaparral.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was up at an unearthly hour. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was necessary for him to rise early in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to cook his breakfast and drown</seg><seg type="columnLine">his campfire before the newcomers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were about, for they must not see his</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke. The dawn was still gray when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stole out and down the creek to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Omar Khayyam, whom he found lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and sound asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He roused the horse, led him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creek for water, and gave him a gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erous feed of barley. Watering him</seg><seg type="columnLine">again after he had eaten, he begged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to be patient until evening, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then hurried back to his rendezvous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Omar could go without his noonday</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal in a cause like this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All day long, intermittently, Aaron</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the girl trying to spade up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cattle-patched land. She had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloves, it seemed, but had tied hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kerchiefs about her burning hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once or twice the man came out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">help her, but she would not allow it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She rested for an hour at a time, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">bravely returned to her task again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What a pitifully small space she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaded up when evening came! Wea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rily, about four o'clock, she trailed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin. The water buckets were full,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she found, for Aaron had seen the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneak cautiously down to the spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them when her back was turned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had set them down twice between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spring and the cabin. Once Aaron</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought the girl was about to catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at this forbidden task, but she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped her work only to watch a robin</seg><seg type="columnLine">filling his bill with the worms that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spaded up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Impatiently the watcher waited for</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness. When it came, and he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lights gleaming in the cabin win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows, he hurried down and followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creek bed to his horse. He watered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fed him, then rode him up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some time had elapsed, and now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin lights were out. He waited half</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour to make sure that the occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pants were asleep, then led Omar</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the flat and up to the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">plow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In no time the tangled harness was</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened out and Omar into it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aaron hitched him to the plow. He set</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point, and a soft flip of one line</seg><seg type="columnLine">started Omar on his accustomed task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Never before had Omar's master</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him walk so fast, and never be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore had he plowed at night. But what</seg><seg type="columnLine">ENCHANTED RANCH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">133</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mattered it? All things were well with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Omar when this man directed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">destiny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In regular, even rows the soil rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the mold board. The only sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the soft thud of Omar's immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet as they trod the matted grass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Furrow aftwr furrow appeared as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">by magic. Gradually the land turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacker and blacker under the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the plowers, weaving back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth, neared the creek. The last fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row was turned at two o'clock in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. They harrowed the piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice in three-quarters of an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then Aaron Rose had another in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiration. He left the plow close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">completion of the work. At the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last furrow he left the harrow, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of dragging it back to the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had found it. He unharness-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the Clyde, and laid the harness on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground, leaving the traces still</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooked to the single-tree. He went for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knock 'Em Dead's collar and laid it</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it would be if the old mare had</seg><seg type="columnLine">plowed and harrowed the land while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ranchers slept, and had jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of her harness when she had fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the big boy-man called Aaron</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rose, chuckling happily, rode Omar</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the canyon and back toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rose Ranch, loosing the horse in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">county road two miles from home. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog-trotted most of the way back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grapevine Creek, in order to be on</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand when the girl came out to spade</seg><seg type="columnLine">that morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Diantha Stanley was cooking break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast over the little second-hand wood</seg><seg type="columnLine">stove that she and her brother had .ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired when they started on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">great adventure. Duncan had risen be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore her and begun work on his book,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the one over which he had been toiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">for thirteen years--the book that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruined his health and which seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">destined never to be completed. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a book of general science, and science</seg><seg type="columnLine">was progressing with such leaps and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounds that Duncan was obliged to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vise and revise and revise his book</seg><seg type="columnLine">continually.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their hoijne had been San Francisco,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where she had worked as a typist</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Duncan pursued his studies. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no college degree, but he was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ardent student and, by dint of hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">work and what seemed almost bound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less scientific knowledge, hoped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcome this drawback. She had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to support him, and now and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had earned a little from lectures</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he delivered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then, while they were struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">bravely and managing to make both</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends meet, came the bitter blow. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dropped in the street one day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taken to the Emergency Hospital,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had been resuscitated, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">case had been diagnosed as angina pec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toris, a rather rare disease of the heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was advised to renounce tobacco,</seg><seg type="columnLine">alcoholic liquors, and coffee. He must</seg><seg type="columnLine">do no more physical work than abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely necessary, and he must not</seg><seg type="columnLine">study so hard.

Well, maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is. Anyway, it seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be growing more</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful every day.

So here's</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Magician's answer to the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">qxLestion, and Pm afraid it's not a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">good one:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That big round pool in the creek be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low the little falls is pretty deep. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">seasons Pve noticed water in it as long</seg><seg type="columnLine">as three months after the creek stop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped running. I think that perhaps wa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter seeps into it from some hillside</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring, but of this I can't be certain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is so well shaded that maybe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of evaporation by the sun causes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water to remain there so long.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anyway, it is your only hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You must get a small gasoline en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gine and a small pump, and, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creek stops running and you can no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer bring the water onto your gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den by gravity, you must pump it from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hole below the falls. It is just pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible that, with the rather heavy rains</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had last winter, you can pump</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to keep your things growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they have matured. But you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">save your water, once you start to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pump. Don't waste it. You'll have grav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity water until the first of June, any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and you needn't buy your engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">until shortly before then.

No, Cy Hurley had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">business here at all, and Aaron did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">like it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They removed a crate, tied on be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind, which evidently contained chick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ens. Then came groceries and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessities, and poultry netting. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">zanjero loosed the hens, which went</seg><seg type="columnLine">contentedly about their daily task of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting for things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three sat together before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin for half an hour, and finally Cy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rus accompanied them within. A little</seg><seg type="columnLine">later Aaron saw him washing his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a basin on the porch. He was stay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for supper, it seemed!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What if they tell him about me! was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aaron's concerned thought. And what's</seg><seg type="columnLine">he doin' here, anyway?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cyrus rode away shortly after dusk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl waving after him from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch. Then she hurried into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, and ten minutes later Aaron</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just barely able to see her figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she hurried with a note to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">notched stick in the garden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cabin lights had been agleam an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour before he felt safe to crawl down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and secure it.

The Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gician and Diantha exchanged many</seg><seg type="columnLine">letters, all sent and received through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the post-office stick. While the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bright Aaron helped to mend the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence, stealing down and picking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tools where the girl had left them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was necessary only to stretch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old, rusty barbed wire across both</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends of the canyon and run it well into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deep chaparral on either side, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dense brush covering of the hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">made an impenetrable barrier on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north and south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When Diantha and Duncan had com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted their chicken lot, Aaron sneak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed down one night and banked it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about with dirt, to make it more dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficult for carniverous animals to crawl</seg><seg type="columnLine">under it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daily his letters guided their simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">operations--simple to him but vastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">complicated to their inexperienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds.

They set it</seg><seg type="columnLine">up beside the deep pool, and Cy work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed industriously at laying the two-inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe line to the site of a prospective</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditch which would border the garden.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The engine coughed and stuttered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheezed when they set it going, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran and poured a sizeable stream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water from the end of the pipe line.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now' Diantha started digging her ditch</seg><seg type="columnLine">by hand, and in one night's work</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aaron completed it. For which he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fervently thanked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So ran the days and nights on The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Enchantpd Ranch, and once more the</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveler and the burro passed along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ridge between the Falcon and him</seg><seg type="columnLine">who hid in the chaparral. Once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man told himself that there would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be another trip next month, and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued his secret vigil over The En-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanted Ranch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hurley was coming frequently. Ev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery two or three days he put in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance, and Aaron wondered if his</seg><seg type="columnLine">job were not suffering and his assis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tants muttering vague complaints.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aaron sighed with jealousy. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">well what brought Hurley to The En-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanted Ranch, why he had worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">industriously at laying the pipe line</seg><seg type="columnLine">and persuading the old engine to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stammer metallically again. Diantha</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the answer. But Aaron had cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned her to tell nobody of his strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">administration of the ranch, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had promised faithfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The green things were up, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pseudo-ranchers were irrigating them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with gravity water, taken from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creek at a point a hundred yards above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the garden. Everything was growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, and the face of the girl showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiness. There had been some vege-</seg><seg type="columnLine">144</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tables for the table, but by far the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">prolific crop that The Enchanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ranch had delivered was grasshoppers</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the rooster and his harem. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat was growing, too, and gradually,</seg><seg type="columnLine">day by day, the creek was gurgling</seg><seg type="columnLine">softer notes as it receded from its wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">silt banks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came an afternoon when there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was but a tiny trickle into the deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">pool below the little falls. Next day, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">about eleven o'clock, the creek had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased to run. Ranchers above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stanleys were taking all the water. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran again during the night and up un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til the heat of the following day, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased again entirely. Pools began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry up in the fierce heat of June. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">week's time the only water that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained, save for shallow pools here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there that were alive with tad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poles and baby trout destined to die</seg><seg type="columnLine">before maturity, was that in the deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole beneath the dead waterfall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The beans, cauliflower, corn, cucum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers, sweet potatoes, melons, squash</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tomatoes were in and growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">nicely. They would be thirsty soon. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was time to test the endurance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water supply in the pool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Start 'pumping tomorrow morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aaron Rose printed on a paper sack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's only about two feet of soil un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der your plants.

So ir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigate lightly and often, rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">give the ground a thorough soaking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">long intervals. If you do that, the wa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter will only seep through to the nig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger-heads and run back into the creek</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed. You are now at the critical period.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the pool holds out, and your engine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, you'll have a fine garden. I'll help</seg><seg type="columnLine">you all I can.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So having read this communication,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Diantha and Duncan started the engine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at nine o'clock the following morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything worked beautifully. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine hesitated and stuttered, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept a stream of water flowing from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the two-inch pipe. Diantha</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Duncan worked ahead of the flow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making furrows between the plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows with their hoes. Aaron looked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his telescope with a sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction. But about eleven o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">he noticed the alarming shallowness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They'll pump her clean dry before</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon," he surmised. "Then we can see</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether or not I'm right about a seep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age from hillside springs. They'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run water again in about five days.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the seepage amounts to anything,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pool ought to fill again in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pool went dry about one o'clock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the garden had received plenty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water for that irrigation. Next day the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranchers covered their furrows with</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose earth, and two days afterward</seg><seg type="columnLine">they cultivated with rake and hoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the pool was not filling, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what little water remained below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach of the little pump, was fast be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sucked up by the sun. Three days</seg><seg type="columnLine">more went by, and the mud in the bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom of the pool was dry and cracking</seg><seg type="columnLine">into shards. Aaron had been getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his water, since the creek gave out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a spring a good distance down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canyon. Diantha wrote him a note</seg><seg type="columnLine">fraught with alarm. Would their spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">go dry, too? she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aaron's return note reassured her</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this point. He had never known the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring on the old John Wharton Place</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cease its flowing. They had better</seg><seg type="columnLine">dig a small reservoir below it and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pound the water that went to waste</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the night. They could siphon</seg><seg type="columnLine">it out, he said, and carry it to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ENCHANTED RANCH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">145</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thirsting plants through their pipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">line. It would not be much, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might save some things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For three days the brother and sis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter worked in following these sugges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. They unjointed the pipe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried it below the spring, where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">screwed the joints together again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They dug a tiny reservoir with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort, and it filled to overflowing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first night after its completion. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had driven out with Knock 'Em Dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and secured a short length of hose;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now Diantha practiced sucking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water through it to start the si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phoning process. When it was flowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">freely, she thrust the end of the hose</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the two-inch pipe, which carried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water to 'the garden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in an hour and a half the reser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voir was empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before their eyes, now, the plants</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wilting. The flow from the spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not sufficient to take care of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cucumbers and melons--all exception-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally thirsty plants. Aaron saw the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spair in the eyes of both. The threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened loss, of their garden loomed as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragedy, for their account in the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very low.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aaron Rose, too, was in despair. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">more hot days and the garden would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be only a bitter memory. It must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">water immediately to survive--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no water. Rain was out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question. No one thinks of rain in</seg><seg type="columnLine">California after the middle of May.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the middle of May was a month</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oh, Magician, can't you do some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing?

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">early rays, streaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her window, awoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">Diantha.

He had intimated in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">note that it was the work of his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She believed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old engine was snorting, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pump revolving, and water trickling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the furrows to the eager plants</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Cyrus Hurley rode in on his big</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorrel horse. He left the horse before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin and strode down to the gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den to talk with the ranchers while</seg><seg type="columnLine">they worked at the distribution of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at them in an odd way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Diantha thought, and there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">twitching at one corner of his mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He gazed often at the pool of water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and remarked once that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it would be dry by this time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duncan started to speak, but Diantha</seg><seg type="columnLine">ENCHANTED RANCH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">147</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nudged him and gave him a significant</seg><seg type="columnLine">look.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">found Cyrus devouring her with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark eyes. He smiled as his glance en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countered hers, and slowly one eyelid</seg><seg type="columnLine">drooped in a crafty wink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duncan had begun a labored ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planation of his use of the word</seg><seg type="columnLine">"again," but Hurley was telling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl that he merely had dropped in on</seg><seg type="columnLine">them a moment, having been in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyon looking for some stray cows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his, and must be getting back to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. He commented on the healthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">look of their garden, which look, if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">existed, was of very recent origin, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked back to his sorrel horse. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved good-by at the gate, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse pressed his way through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaparral to the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the hight, what was perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greatest catastrophe yet overtook</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Enchanted Ranch. A jack rabbit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandering from the chaparral in</seg><seg type="columnLine">search of something green, discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the garden and sojourned in a region</seg><seg type="columnLine">of delectability. Muskmelon vines, cu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumber vines, peas, beans--all were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">laid low by his long sharp teeth. This,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought poor Diantha, was the "un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindest cut of all." They could not af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford the money to buy more poultry</seg><seg type="columnLine">netting to keep the rabbits out. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen or more handsome plants had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen prey to this new menace. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabbit would come again, and bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">his family. They would tell others, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other families would come to the feast</seg><seg type="columnLine">of salad. The pool was empty of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, but they were used to wonders</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and expected it to fill at any time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But how could they fight the rabbits?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Diantha had seen the down plants</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her window and had hurried out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them. The night before she had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">a note in the cloven stick thanking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">magician for the brimming pool. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">devastated portion of the garden had</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed her thoughts till now, but on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hurried way back to make report</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Duncan she saw the familiar bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow paper in the cleft. She changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">course and plucked it out, to read:</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dear Diantha:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It's just too bad, that's all. I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they'd done to the cukes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">melons first thing this morning. I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose you can't afford to buy poultry</seg><seg type="columnLine">netting. It would cost a lot to fence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that plot, and would take a lot of time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Too much work, too, for one seasor\'s</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden. You'll remember you're not</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to be here next year.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So here's The Magician's suggestion:</seg><seg type="columnLine">Go up the road about a mile, and turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">off up the little canyon on the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">just beyond the big rock that over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hangs the road. You know it. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are big black oaks above it, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them is growing right out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone and leaning over the road and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creek. Well, follow that canyon to</seg><seg type="columnLine">its beginning, then cut off toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north over the hills. You'll presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">148	ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">i</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">see a big blasted Bigger "pine. Keep on</seg><seg type="columnLine">past it in the same direction and you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to a cow trail that meanders</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the chaparral toward the Fal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">con River. After you've folloioed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">about an eighth of a mile, you'll sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly find the land dropping aivay be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low you over a thousand feet, down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river's level. Just as soon as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight the river, turn to your right, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">press through the chaparral until you</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to an old dead white oak. Under</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rock close to this white oak you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">find a gunny sack filled with steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">traps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If you can't carry all of them at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip, make two trips. Spread the traps</seg><seg type="columnLine">over your garden and stake them</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. Set them, and you'll not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">save your garden but have young jack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabbit for dinner tomorrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I'd set these traps for you myself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but for reasons that I can't explain I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't do it noiv. And, anyway. The Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gician helps those who help them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Luck to you!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Magician.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond all doubt the note had, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time at least, been placed in the cleft</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stick after sunup; for The Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gician could not have seen the devas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated melon and cucumber patches</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the dark remained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he had underscored You'll re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member you're not going to be here</seg><seg type="columnLine">next year? How did he know?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was distractingly pretty that</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning as she set off after the traps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with The Magician's note, containing</seg><seg type="columnLine">her instructions. She wore her new</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-laced hiking-boots, an old felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat of her brother's, and a short whip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord skirt. Under grapevines and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawling limbs of oaks she followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creek road, sniffing the odors of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">alders and flowering buckeyes. All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way she noticed the evidences of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recent miraculous flow of the stream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where the creek banks were not com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed of stones and boulders, as was</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually the case, cracking mud show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. Now and then she encountered</seg><seg type="columnLine">pools where the water had settled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently she saw the grim rock that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the note mentioned just ahead. She re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered it well, it was so pictur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esque. With her eyes upon it she did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not notice that there were no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">any pools of water nor muddy banks</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she passed along, but just before</seg><seg type="columnLine">she reached the rock she became aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dryness of the creek bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, no water has run here recent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly!" she exclaimed. "I'm going back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out where the dryness begins."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Accordingly, she retraced her steps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not far back she encountered</seg><seg type="columnLine">moisture once more, with dryness just</seg><seg type="columnLine">above it. She crept through brush and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grapevines into the creek bed for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorough investigation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At once she saw a little branch can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yon that extended into the hills almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">at right angles to the main bed of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creek. This branch watercourse was</seg><seg type="columnLine">moist, while the creek bed proper was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry above it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It came down that ravine," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "And I'm going up it--if I can."</seg><seg type="columnLine">For two hours she struggled ever up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward over outcroppings of stone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">creeping under the branches. All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way the bottom of the ravine was</seg><seg type="columnLine">moist. And then, on the side of a hill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she suddenly encountered a branch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the branch ravine, extending at right</seg><seg type="columnLine">angles to the direction in which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been scrambling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The branch, much smaller than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main ravine, was moist, while the ra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vine above it, squirming on up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ENCHANTED RANCH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">149</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hills, was dry as bone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was about to turn off and follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">this branch watercourse to its source,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she noted that it did not end at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ravine. An elongated depression</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended from the ravine on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, evidently a continuation. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry, and a thorough examination of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved that it was an ancient ditch</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, following the contours of the hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the west. She saw the marks of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spade where it crossed the ravine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stepped to the other side and</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed the moist portion of the ditch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It circled about the hills on a shelf,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and every now and then she saw where</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had recently been mended with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spade or shovel. Then, almost before</seg><seg type="columnLine">she knew it, she found herself in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">well defined path and looking down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the racing water in a great canal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a way the small moist ditch fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed the canal, and she followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditch. Then she came to a weir, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she did not know what it was. She rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soned, however, that the mechanism</seg><seg type="columnLine">she saw before her was designed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">check the flow of water in the canal</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that it would rise to the level of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge pipe line that she saw on the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite bank. When it had risen to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of that pipe, she thought, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would flow through it to some ranch</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other side of the ridge. In this</seg><seg type="columnLine">instance, however, everything pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the belief that the pipe line</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been left closed, as it was now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the water, when checked, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">risen and flowed through a man-made</seg><seg type="columnLine">break in the bank of the canal on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. It had spilled out into the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditch, and eventually, by way of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little ravine, it was delivered to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry bed of Grapevine Creek and thence</seg><seg type="columnLine">to The Enchanted Ranch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Diantha stood in thought, a finger</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to her lips. Then she half whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an awed little voice: "He stole that</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. The Magician stole'it from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big water company, and sent it down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to--to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up the path a sorrel horse stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly as a man reined it in with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerk. For just a moment Cyrus Hurley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">zanjero for the water company, sat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his saddle looking at the thoughtful</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl. And then, as softly as possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he moved his horse into the chaparral,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismounted, and stole back on foot to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Chapter Twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">Traps</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       *^ELL, the water had</seg><seg type="columnLine">^gr»/ been stolen.

Once more she ducked under</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrapy branches as she trailed the ra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vine down to Grapevine Creek. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">could she know that Cyrus Hurley was</seg><seg type="columnLine">following her? Her progress made</seg><seg type="columnLine">such noise that the sound of his was</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She descended to the floor of Grape-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vine Canyon much swifter than she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had climbed to the canal. Noon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still far off as she turned away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big rock that overhung the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walked up the hill on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, on the lookout for the blasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Digger pine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She discovered it eventually and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued on, until, finally, a dizzying</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope di'opped from her very feet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she found herself looking over a vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">350</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL WESTERN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">forest, down at the green Falcon River,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing pell-mell to the lower levels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She heard its roar, and from around a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp bend, cut off by innumerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, came the rumble of machinery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from where she had been told a gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">dredger was at work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time she gazed, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene was spellbinding. Then she fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed directions and entered the chap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arral, to find the dead white oak in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and the sack of traps cached un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der an overhanging stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She decided, after speculation, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could carry half of them. So she</seg><seg type="columnLine">emptied the sack of half its contents,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hid the loose traps again, and took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sack containing the remainder upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She passed through the chaparral to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old trail, and immediately after she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had started following it toward home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she rounded a brushy bend and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself face to face writh Hurley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stopped, alarmed. There was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd look of deepest interest in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">zanjero's eyes. His smile was trium-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, hello, Miss Stanley!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted, perhaps too loudly.
