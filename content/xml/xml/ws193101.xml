PAUL, Art Editor</p><p>C. P. MASON, Associate Editor </p><p>WONDERS OF THE VACUUM </p><p>By HUGO GERNSBACK </p><p>LL nature abhors a vacuum.” </p><p>So runs the well-known say- </p><p>ing, attributed to Descartes; </p><p>although it probably was used </p><p>long before Descartes was </p><p>box'll. </p><p>Like many similar popular sayings, that </p><p>under consideration may be classed as almost </p><p>completely false. Indeed, all nature does not </p><p>abhor the vacuum; quite the contrary. Well </p><p>over 99% of nature (that is, the entire visible </p><p>and invisible universe) is itself a vast vac- </p><p>uum. All the cosmos, with the exception of </p><p>the widely-separated locations filled with mat- </p><p>ter such as the suns and planets, is a void </p><p>and this void itself is an extraordinary good </p><p>vacuum. </p><p>Science today knows that, if you rise 1,000 </p><p>miles above the surface of the earth you will </p><p>find as high a vacuum or better than that </p><p>contained in an up-to-date X-ray tube; which </p><p>is about as good a vacuum as can be pro- </p><p>duced with our most modern machinery. </p><p>Indeed, if it were not for this almost per- </p><p>fect vacuum, which constitutes practically </p><p>the entire universe, there would be no such </p><p>thing as the motion of the heavenly bodies. </p><p>The earth and all of the other solar planets </p><p>maintain their perpetual motion around the </p><p>sun for only one reason, and that is because </p><p>the planets move in a perfect frictionless </p><p>medium—a vacuum. </p><p>If there were no such vacuum, the planets, </p><p>with their satellites, would long have come </p><p>to a standstill. </p><p>Let us suppose, for example, that the </p><p>entire visible universe were filled with a </p><p>fairly good, though not perfect, vacuum,</p><p>such as that found in our incandescent lamps, </p><p>where quite a few air molecules are left. </p><p>Then the friction they set up against the </p><p>motion of the planets would be sufficient to </p><p>retard them as well as the other heavenly </p><p>bodies and they would have stopped moving </p><p>aeons ago. The mere fact that outer space </p><p>is such a good vacuum is the reason that </p><p>the heavenly bodies will go on circling in </p><p>their orbits for millions and billions of years </p><p>without being impeded in their flight. </p><p>Furthermore, we know what happens when </p><p>a meteor strikes the upper reaches of our </p><p>atmosphere, which in itself is a fairly good </p><p>vacuum, but not a “hard” one. The meteor </p><p>is almost immediately consumed by the ter- </p><p>rific friction set up. Now the earth, as well </p><p>773 </p><p>as other heavenly bodies, move as fast or </p><p>faster than the average meteor, and if they </p><p>did not move in such a perfect vacuum, they </p><p>would be consumed in short order by the </p><p>terrific friction, if their motion was not </p><p>slowed down before. </p><p>Of course, to the human being, the idea </p><p>of the vacuum may be appalling because we </p><p>cannot picture ourselves living in anything </p><p>but air. We are in this respect much like a </p><p>fish, who, deprived of his water, will soon </p><p>asphyxiate. So if we ever visit outer space, </p><p>we must provide ourselves with our own at- </p><p>mosphere and wear air-proof helmets and </p><p>clothes, otherwise we would not only suf- </p><p>focate but suffer much worse dangers. </p><p>The human body at sea level is constant- </p><p>ly subject to an atmospheric pressure which </p><p>amounts to 14.7 pounds per square inch. We </p><p>are like deep-sea fish who at the bottom of </p><p>the ocean are constantly subject to a terrific </p><p>pressure. Balloonists who have ascended to </p><p>the highest part of the atmosphere that </p><p>could be reached, which is only a trifling </p><p>39,000 feet, are always troubled by nose </p><p>bleeds and blood spurting from underneath </p><p>their finger nails. If the same balloonists </p><p>could ascent only a mere twenty miles above </p><p>the surface of the earth, they would almost </p><p>explode because the skin, no longer subject </p><p>to the atmospheric pressure, would probably </p><p>burst open, and the blood working internally </p><p>at a high pressure would in addition flow </p><p>from all the human orifices. This provided </p><p>always that there is a measure of heat.</p><p>A number of science fiction authors have </p><p>mentioned the dangers of a lack of pressure </p><p>on the human body in their writings, and </p><p>stressed the point that human beings would </p><p>summarily explode if ejected from a space </p><p>flyer into open space. </p><p>This idea is open to some controversy, for </p><p>the writers have left the terrific cold en- </p><p>countered in open space out of their calcu- </p><p>lations. It is my opinion that if you eject </p><p>a human being without protection from a </p><p>space flyer, he will not have sufficient time </p><p>to explode because he will probably be froz- </p><p>en solid instantaneously. At best, the effects </p><p>of the lack of pressure, such as the blood </p><p>squirting from the skin and orifices, will </p><p>not get very- far before the body is frozen </p><p>solid by the absolute lack of heat, the body </p><p>temperature shooting down perpendicularly </p><p>to nearly absolute zero, or minus 278 degrees </p><p>Centigrade. </p><p>The Satellite </p><p>of Doom D. D. Sharp </p><p>The drawn face of the old man pressed against the glass. There seem- </p><p>_ I to be a hopeless bravery in the haggard features. </p><p>774 </p><p>While A World. Waited Breathlessly The Satellite Went </p><p>On and On, Repeating Its Circles of Doom! </p><p>CHAPTER I </p><p>JUST before they reached the front steps </p><p>Professor Mullin stopped and touched </p><p>Clifford on the arm. </p><p>“There is one man you must watch.” </p><p>“Who?” Clifford asked, still occupied </p><p>with the crisis ahead of him. </p><p>“Briggs. Rothberg calls him BB, but he </p><p>isn’t an air gun charge at all. He is buck- </p><p>shot with a full charge of smokeless powder </p><p>behind him.” </p><p>“Just what do you mean?” Clifford asked </p><p>with interest awakened. </p><p>“Briggs is a keen chemist, maker of mod- </p><p>els for Rothberg’s would-be inventors. He </p><p>is Police Commissioner with a strong po- </p><p>litical influence and he is the husband of </p><p>Rothberg’s only daughter, ambitious and </p><p>dangerous. Don't let him know how much </p><p>mj)ney Rothberg is thinking of putting into </p><p>your scheme.” </p><p>“What does he look like?” </p><p>“Tall and unforgetable. Not much of a </p><p>description, eh?” </p><p>“Well, I don’t know about that. There </p><p>aren't many men who are unforgetable as </p><p>far as personal appearance is concerned.” </p><p>“Briggs is. He’d impress the most phleg- </p><p>matic; a deep growl, large protruding black </p><p>eyes, overscored with crow feathers. He </p><p>drops into these meetings sometimes. I </p><p>hope he doesn’t come in tonight, but if he </p><p>does, ramble off on some unimportant de- </p><p>tail. He might queer your whole plan.” </p><p>“Would Rothberg allow him to interfere?” </p><p>“No. Rothberg doesn’t take dictation </p><p>from anybody. But Briggs is buckshot, re- </p><p>member that, and I believe he suspects </p><p>what’s up.” </p><p>They mounted the steps and followed a </p><p>footman to a long room, down the center </p><p>of which ran a polished table. </p><p>Clifford’s zero hour was at hand. He </p><p>knew by reputation every man around that </p><p>table. They were all outstanding men in </p><p>their particular fields of science. Directly</p><p>in front of him sat J. G. Reed who had more </p><p>than once startled the world with ideas </p><p>of matter and space; next was Played who </p><p>775 </p><p>experimented with rockets; Stortz the as- </p><p>tronomer who had at last proved the ro- </p><p>tation of Venus; Gertz the electrical wizard; </p><p>Guriy, who had explained the apparent </p><p>discrepancy in the ratio of gravitation be- </p><p>tween Mercury and the sun; Ralls, who had </p><p>taken the new tidal theory of the forma- </p><p>tion of the earth and blown it to smither- </p><p>eens; Phil Lips who had set forth a compli- </p><p>cated thesis which had grown out of Ein- </p><p>stein’s Relativity, and a half dozen others. </p><p>At the head of the table was, of course, old </p><p>Jacob Rothberg, who, with the magnet of </p><p>his money and personality had assembled </p><p>these filings from the fields of science. </p><p>Clifford caught the pale eyes of Professor </p><p>Charles of Rothberg University appraising </p><p>him. He felt a personal antipathy in that </p><p>cold, passionless stare and it upset lm» so </p><p>he barely heard ihe opening of Rothbeig’s </p><p>address. Even as he heard Rolhheig call- </p><p>ing upon him to explain his plan, he re- </p><p>tained the uneasy sensation that the Pro- </p><p>fessor was coolly dissecting him. </p><p>He shook ofT the uncomfortable feeling </p><p>as he rose and the double row of white </p><p>faces about the table turned toward him. </p><p>His big moment was at hand. He started </p><p>speaking looking straight at Ralls, for </p><p>Ralls flourished upon his reputation as an </p><p>iconoclast, and would, of course, maintain </p><p>his position as a breaker of idols und a </p><p>destroyer of dreams. Ralls’ lean features </p><p>were ravenously alert as Clifford began. </p><p>“Gentlemen, my proposal is to launch </p><p>a ship just beyond the atmosphere so that </p><p>it will form a satellite of the earth. It </p><p>would need no refueling and no additional </p><p>power, except that required to send cargo </p><p>to and from the ship.” </p><p>BACK of Ralls a door opened and </p><p>through it a man glided cautiously, </p><p>slopped and closed the door behind him. </p><p>Undoubtedly it was Briggs. The man’s </p><p>whole appearance was strange and unfor- </p><p>getable. </p><p>Clifford hesitated, and then decided to go </p><p>ahead and pay Briggs no attention; but he </p><p>did not have an opportunity. Professor </p><p>776 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>Charles rose, placed the tips of his long </p><p>white fingers spiderlike upon the manu- </p><p>script below him and cleared his stringy </p><p>looking throat. </p><p>Clifford was taken aback at the double </p><p>interruption and folded his arms and waited </p><p>calmly for what the psychologist had to </p><p>say. </p><p>“Mr. Peterson,” Professor Charles </p><p>whined in a high, fine </p><p>voice, “How do you </p><p>k.:ow, or we know, </p><p>that it is possible to </p><p>project a ship beyond </p><p>the field of gravity of </p><p>our earth?” </p><p>“Sure,” Briggs </p><p>growled in that deep </p><p>bass of his, “That’s </p><p>the berries! All he </p><p>wants is to spend some </p><p>of the governor’s mon- </p><p>ey!” </p><p>Rothberg hitched </p><p>about in his chair to </p><p>face his son-in-law, </p><p>but the hard stare in </p><p>the penetrating old </p><p>eyes brought only a </p><p>stubborn resistance. </p><p>Rothberg signaled un- </p><p>mistakably for Briggs </p><p>to leave the room and </p><p>fire flashed between </p><p>the two as Briggs </p><p>leaned casually against </p><p>the marble wainscoat- </p><p>ing and extracted a </p><p>cork-tipped cigarette </p><p>and stuck it between </p><p>his lips. </p><p>Rothberg half rose </p><p>from his chair and </p><p>roared, “BB you get </p><p>out!” </p><p>Briggs drew himself erect, his cheeks flam- </p><p>ing; then he sent a long cloud of defiant </p><p>smoke in Rothberg's direction, shrugged his</p><p>shoulders and growled in his bearlike bass: </p><p>“All right, governor.” </p><p>Then he left the room. </p><p>Clifford turned his attention back to Pro- </p><p>fessor Charles and continued. </p><p>“Of course it is impossible to fire any pro- </p><p>jectile totally beyond the earth’s gravity. </p><p>Newton has shown that each body in space </p><p>is attracted to every other according to their </p><p>masses and the inverse ratio of the square </p><p>of their distances.” </p><p>“So, so,” the professor coughed slightly, </p><p>then took his glasses </p><p>from his nose and </p><p>held them as a pointer </p><p>in Clifford’s direction </p><p>as he continued. </p><p>“But one can not </p><p>get around the fact </p><p>that you would have </p><p>to send your ship far </p><p>enough from the earth </p><p>to enter into cosmic </p><p>space if it is to float </p><p>continually without </p><p>falling. How do you </p><p>know that you can </p><p>project anything that </p><p>far? How do you </p><p>know how far that </p><p>is?” </p><p>Clifford tried to be </p><p>patient, but it was </p><p>quite evident that </p><p>however eminent Pro- </p><p>fessor Charles was in </p><p>his own line, he knew </p><p>very little of astrono- </p><p>my. </p><p>“Bodies do not float </p><p>in space,” Clifford be- </p><p>gan. “They are pulled </p><p>toward each other. </p><p>What keeps them from </p><p>flying together in a </p><p>huge mass is their vel- </p><p>ocity, which is much </p><p>greater than that of a </p><p>highpowered rifle bullet as it leaves the </p><p>gun. They move with hurricanes of speed</p><p>which would belittle cyclones. It is this </p><p>that overcomes the pull of gravitation.” </p><p>He reached into his pocket and extracted </p><p>a small rubbber ball which was attached </p><p>to a rubber string. </p><p>7V7O idea more startling </p><p>1 in the history of our </p><p>earth has been proposed </p><p>than that put forward by </p><p>Hermann Oberth, the Ger- </p><p>man rocket expert. By </p><p>sending a rocket aloft some </p><p>four or five hundred miles </p><p>above the earth and giving </p><p>it a speed of about 5 miles </p><p>ot second,Herr Oberth states, </p><p>the rocket will circle the </p><p>earth until eternity without </p><p>further expenditure of </p><p>power!' A terrific idea, </p><p>filled with the most stu- </p><p>pendous possibilities for </p><p>the people of the earth. It </p><p>may revolutionize transpor- </p><p>tation, or warfare; it may </p><p>even change the whole </p><p>course **f out lives. </p><p>But although it is an idea </p><p>filled with the most dra- </p><p>matic and adventurous sug- </p><p>gestions Mr. Sharp does </p><p>not want to deal with them </p><p>fantastically. He has writ- </p><p>ten instead a story of in- </p><p>tense realism sticking close </p><p>to life and truth, with </p><p>characters that live and </p><p>breathe. And so he has </p><p>made this story as vivid </p><p>and understandable as is </p><p>humanly possible.	^</p><p>THE SATELLITE OF DOOM </p><p>777 </p><p>“You will notice when this little ball ia </p><p>idle it hangs toward the earth.” </p><p>He began to whirl the ball around and </p><p>aiound and it went humming over his head. </p><p>“When enough speed is attained gravity </p><p>is overcome and the ball rises into the air. </p><p>To make the illustration plain, let the </p><p>string be the pull of gravity and my thumb </p><p>be the sun.” </p><p>He whirled the ball faster. The rubber </p><p>string stretched, as he went on. </p><p>“When the speed of the ball increases, </p><p>the orbit increases. It stretched the pull of </p><p>thf* rubber ’gravity.1 When the speed de- </p><p>creases the orbit narrows. This illustrates </p><p>simply the forces which hold every body </p><p>in space to its proper </p><p>place. </p><p>“Any body moving </p><p>around the sun with a </p><p>speed less than 18.6 </p><p>miles per second must </p><p>have an orbit smaller </p><p>than that of the earth, </p><p>and one having more </p><p>than 18.6 miles per </p><p>second would have a </p><p>larger orbit than that </p><p>of the earth, while one </p><p>with a velocity of ex- </p><p>ceeding 26 miles per </p><p>second would fly away </p><p>from the sun for good. </p><p>“Now, suppose we </p><p>fire a ship from the </p><p>earth so that its speed is 18.6 miles per sec- </p><p>ond. At that velocity it should pace the </p><p>earth forever and apparently move across </p><p>the earth’s surface from east to west as the </p><p>earth turns on its axis. That ship should </p><p>make one trip about the earth every twenty- </p><p>four hours.” </p><p>A Gigantic Plan </p><p>HE paused and let the little rubber ball </p><p>hang idly from its string as he glanced </p><p>at the studious faces regarding him. Then </p><p>his glance went back to Ralls, who had</p><p>leaned forward, elbows upon the table, chin </p><p>wrinkled into the palms of his big hands. </p><p>fingers working upon his lean cheeks. He </p><p>was smiling tolerantly and yet there was </p><p>something belittling in the expression of </p><p>his eyes. He impressed Clifford as a strong </p><p>man who had braced himself to wrestle with </p><p>an iron weight and just discovered it waa </p><p>cork. </p><p>“Your illustration is interesting, but your </p><p>astronomy is faulty,” Ralls drawled with </p><p>rather a bored air. “Everything upon this </p><p>earth is moving around the sun at a velocity </p><p>of 18.6 miles per second. A ship placed </p><p>just outside the earth’s atmosphere and giv- </p><p>en that velocity and no other would fall at </p><p>once.” </p><p>Clifford saw his mistake. Certainly the </p><p>ship would fall, and </p><p>the flaw in his theory </p><p>rattled him for a mo- </p><p>ment, so that he was </p><p>unable to correct hia </p><p>error. While he strove </p><p>for poise, the bulky, </p><p>rather awkward form </p><p>of Stortz hitched about </p><p>and the big-faced as- </p><p>tronomer smiled en- </p><p>couragingly. Clifford </p><p>felt a rescue at hand. </p><p>“Mister Ralls,” </p><p>Stortz drawled in slow, </p><p>rumbling accents. </p><p>“Our young friend ia </p><p>not so very much in </p><p>error. His mistake is </p><p>starting with the wrong objects. It is not </p><p>the gravity of the sun the ship must over- </p><p>come, for that is already overcome through </p><p>the inertia of the earth. Our problem is </p><p>the law of small bodies moving around </p><p>large bodies. Fortunately this simplifies, </p><p>rather than complicates, the question. The </p><p>ship need not be fired with a velocity of </p><p>18.6 miles per second to form a satellite </p><p>of the earth, but with a speed of only 4.90 </p><p>miles per second. </p><p>“While I don’t want to lend my opinion, </p><p>as yet, for or against this young man’s pro- </p><p>posal, I will state that Oberth, a German </p><p>scientist, has given considerable study to </p><p>the question of rocket ships, and he claim*</p><p>D. D. SHARP </p><p>778 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>that he can develop a vehicle which will </p><p>fly from Europe to America in thirty min- </p><p>utes, and he believes it possible to build </p><p>a space ship which will travel at a velocity </p><p>of about seven miles per second, almost </p><p>double that required by the ship proposed. </p><p>“I might add that Professor R. H. God- </p><p>dard, the American expert, has made a pow- </p><p>der rocket which ejected gases of 8000 </p><p>feet per second, and Opel claims to have </p><p>invented a liquid three times as powerful </p><p>as any powdered fuel, so our goal may not </p><p>be so far off after all.” </p><p>Ralls pursed his lips. Then he turned on </p><p>Clifford. </p><p>“All right,” be snapped, “Grant that </p><p>your space ship can be shot with enough </p><p>velocity to continuously circle the earth, </p><p>how are you going to get your freight </p><p>aboard? Even should you contrive to get </p><p>the packages up there, don't you know that </p><p>inertia would carry them on in orbits of </p><p>their own without your ship?” </p><p>“My plan is to have a system of rockets </p><p>at each city under the path of the satellite. </p><p>These rockets would have compartments for </p><p>storing mail and express and would be </p><p>timed to be fired at the exact fraction of a </p><p>second to make contact with the ship.” </p><p>“What is the need of a ship?" Ralls in- </p><p>terrupted. ‘‘The rockets would circle the </p><p>earth of their own speed.” </p><p>“With no ship,” Clifford answered, “the </p><p>packages could never be brought down at </p><p>all. The purpose of the ship is to provide a </p><p>buttress against which a timed discharge </p><p>in the end of the rocket can be set off to </p><p>kick loose the rocket at its destination. </p><p>The ship, you understand, is not to be a </p><p>container in the sense of an empty hull. It </p><p>is to be a steel cylinder against which the </p><p>rocket can be shot. These rockets will have </p><p>clocks timed for the discharge of their gas- </p><p>es and the rockets will be strongly magnet- </p><p>ized, which will assist them in making con- </p><p>tact with the ship and will hold them firmly </p><p>in place until the reverse discharge takes </p><p>place. The rockets are also to be equipped </p><p>with folding helicopters, which will au-</p><p>tomatically extend and break the return fall </p><p>so as to prevent injury to the rockets or </p><p>CHAPTER II. </p><p>Rothberg Speaks Out </p><p>HE paused again, for his words seemed </p><p>falling on a cast iron personality. </p><p>Ralls was shaking his woolly head, and </p><p>Clifford’s heart sank as he saw affirmation </p><p>of Ralls’ position in the faces of at least </p><p>three of the scientists about the table. He </p><p>hoped that Stortz would come again to his </p><p>rescue, but the old astronomer, while still </p><p>regarding him kindly, seemed lost in </p><p>thought. His glance caught Rothberg, who </p><p>had been sitting silently erect at the head </p><p>of the table. His whole manner seemed </p><p>suddenly changed. His eyes were sparkl- </p><p>ing and alive and he jabbed at a button be- </p><p>side his chair. </p><p>A girl came through a small door at the </p><p>right. Clifford first took her to be Roth- </p><p>berg’s daughter, then he saw a stenograph- </p><p>er’s notebook and pencil, and he decided </p><p>she was a secretary held overtime for this </p><p>meeting. </p><p>She was neat, rather stylishly, yet quiet- </p><p>ly dressed, except for a dash of color at </p><p>her neck and sleeves, and an orange sash </p><p>caught about her slim waist. She look a </p><p>small chair which Rothberg himself dragged </p><p>toward her, and then opened her book, giv- </p><p>ing the men about the table no more than </p><p>a quick glance. </p><p>At the time she did not impress Clifford </p><p>as being more than an ordinary pretty sten- </p><p>ographer. He was not at all interested in </p><p>her, but in what Rothberg was about to </p><p>dictate. </p><p>“Crystal,” Rothberg began quickly with </p><p>a curtness in his tone left over from his </p><p>conflict with Briggs. “Please take down </p><p>these notes and ask Robinson to look over </p><p>them with view of formulating a contract.” </p><p>“Mr. Rothberg,” Professor Charles was </p><p>on his feet. </p><p>Rothberg glanced up and scowled. </p><p>“What is it, Professor?” </p><p>Again Professor Charles had his glasses</p><p>between thumb and forefinger, pointing </p><p>them this time at Rothberg. </p><p>“Have you taken into consideration the </p><p>THE SATELLITE OF DOOM </p><p>779 </p><p>likelihood of a condition of neurosis in the </p><p>applicant?” </p><p>Rothberg rose from his chair, and stepped </p><p>to one side of it. Professor Charles sat </p><p>down leaving his sentence incomplete, but </p><p>still pointed his glasses as though holding </p><p>them ready for instant use. Rothberg smiled </p><p>tolerantly and Clifford knew the objection </p><p>had fallen as lightly as dust. </p><p>“You sound too much like Freud,” Roth- </p><p>berg drawled. “We are not dealing with </p><p>psycho-analysis, but mechanical and cos- </p><p>mic laws.” </p><p>He turned and faced the whole attentive </p><p>board. His eyes lost their twinkle and his </p><p>lips forgot to smile. Instead there seemed </p><p>to be a fire of inspiration growing slowly; </p><p>idealism lifting the materialist above him- </p><p>self. </p><p>“Gentlemen,” he began very quietly, </p><p>“This is one proposal 1 am going to take </p><p>on without waiting for you to fit every </p><p>angle and line into place and pronounce </p><p>Q. E. D.” </p><p>From that point on to the close of his </p><p>speech his eyes burned more and more </p><p>brightly and his voice became more ear- </p><p>nest. </p><p>“'Most men,” he concluded, “desire to </p><p>create something which can be left to on- </p><p>coming generations with the mark of their </p><p>individuality upon it. One may conclude </p><p>this is all vanity, but I believe every great </p><p>work which preserves the marks of genius </p><p>sets a standard for future generations which </p><p>it defies them to excel. </p><p>“Sitting there listening to talk of cosmic </p><p>law it has occurred to me that this young </p><p>man’s dream may be used to leave an im- </p><p>perishable remembrance of us who live </p><p>today. Once upon a time, a Pharaoh, hop- </p><p>ing for immortality, raised the Great Pyr- </p><p>amid of Gizeh; but lasting as that is, it </p><p>shall in time perish, so too shall all the </p><p>light fabric of our own civilization. But </p><p>the ships we launch into space shall never </p><p>decay. They will speed on and on a last-</p><p>ing inspiration to generations yet unborn!” </p><p>LIFFORD caught the fire of Rothberg’s </p><p>idealism and mixed it with the flame of </p><p>his own dream, but a damper was thrown </p><p>upon it immediately for Briggs thrust his </p><p>thin, inquisitive face through the door, gave </p><p>one keeu, searching look about and re- </p><p>treated; but before his face disappeared </p><p>Clifford saw a glaring threat turned upon </p><p>the girl who looked up just in time to catch </p><p>it. She shrank from those black eyes and </p><p>Clifford watched her rather than Briggs. </p><p>It seemed that she was fighting to show no </p><p>fear; but her tightly drawn underlip be- </p><p>trayed her.	|</p><p>When Clifford looked again toward the </p><p>door, Briggs had gone. He wondered what </p><p>the man meant and Rothberg added import- </p><p>ance to the incident by getting upset over </p><p>it. Before that he had seemed aloof, as </p><p>though he was in a world unaffected by </p><p>men and their petty ideas; but now he </p><p>searched every face as though worried </p><p>whether they had penetrated a secret of the </p><p>family closet. When his eyes rested on Clif- </p><p>ford they resumed some of the old fire and </p><p>zeal he had shown while making his short </p><p>speech. He turned quickly and spoke in a </p><p>low tone to the girl. She gathered up her </p><p>notebook and some papers and left the </p><p>room . </p><p>Professor Mullin caught Clifford’s hand </p><p>when they were again outside the hall. </p><p>“I knew you’d win, my boy! I knew it! </p><p>But I must admit I never suspected old </p><p>Rothberg had such a touch of sentiment in </p><p>his makeup.” </p><p>“Here’s the car,” he added as Rothberg’s </p><p>limousine drew to the curb. </p><p>Clifford pulled himself from his reveries </p><p>and tried to keep up his part of the conver- </p><p>sation. He was very grateful for Professor </p><p>Mullin’s help. Had it not been for him very </p><p>likely he would still be working back of a </p><p>glass covered desk at thirty-five dollars per </p><p>week, dreaming of space ships that should </p><p>never be launched. Yet he had not a word </p><p>to say. His thoughts seemed bound to that </p><p>hall with its long polished table and a smart </p><p>looking girl trying to appear composed un- </p><p>der the threat of a tall black-eyed man one</p><p>never forgot. </p><p>And that night he went to bed not en- </p><p>tirely happy. He was worried for fear that </p><p>Briggs wouid do something to upset his </p><p>plans. Three days later, however, he felt </p><p>780 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>more secure about the venture, for he met </p><p>Rothberg and his attorneys down town and </p><p>the contracts were actually signed and the </p><p>work put under way. </p><p>Only .once in the three months that fol- </p><p>lowed did he see the girl, and that was a </p><p>chance meeting in the hall of Rothberg’s </p><p>home. She smiled and bowed her head </p><p>slightly, her gray eyes friendly, and then </p><p>she was gone. </p><p>The end of those three months found the </p><p>ship almost complete and the time drew </p><p>near for her tryout. The morning he got </p><p>this news, Clifford went down to lunch so </p><p>absorbed in a letter from Rothberg which </p><p>gave him the details, that he hardly heard </p><p>die blatant cries of newsboys in the streets. </p><p>Nor did he make out the meaning of them </p><p>until a small fellow with big blue eyes </p><p>thrust a paper under his nose and shouted, </p><p>“Extra mister! Extra! Big banker dis- </p><p>appears!” </p><p>Clifford took one and idly glanced down </p><p>at the picture. Rothberg! Hardly under- </p><p>standing what the picture was about he </p><p>glanced at the headlines. </p><p>Some of the import of those words seeped </p><p>into his shocked brain as he stared down </p><p>unable to read on. Then a dull hurt pos- </p><p>sessed him. He thought of how well he had </p><p>grown to like the millionaire in the short </p><p>lime he had been associated with him. Then </p><p>it came to him that this meant the upsetting </p><p>of every tiling connected with launching the </p><p>ship. Briggs flashed into his mind. If the </p><p>space ship being almost ready to launch had </p><p>anything to do with the time of Rothberg’s </p><p>disappearance. Briggs might be back of it. </p><p>The boy nudged him. “Five cents, mis- </p><p>ter.” </p><p>Clifford pulled a coin from his pocket </p><p>and dropped it into the stubby palm. The </p><p>boy ran on shouting, “Extra! Extra! Big </p><p>banker disappears!” </p><p>For a long time Clifford stood there </p><p>stunned. His house of cards had tumbled </p><p>about him. His dream was only a dream</p><p>after all, his plan only a scheme. The new </p><p>light in his life was not a beacon at the </p><p>port of success, but just a flare of illusion </p><p>somewhere across the strange darkness of </p><p>failure. </p><p>Not for a second did he have any faith </p><p>in Briggs’ going ahead with the work. </p><p>Briggs wasn't the kind to spend a great sum </p><p>of money helping other men attain their </p><p>dreams, and his hand seemed all too plain </p><p>in this. Clifford knew Rothberg had made </p><p>provision for carrying on this work in case </p><p>of his death, but since he had only disap- </p><p>peared the delay in the work would prob- </p><p>ably be dragged out indefinitely. That </p><p>would be like Briggs. </p><p>A Strange Call </p><p>FOR a long time he stood letting his </p><p>thoughts wander on and on. Men and </p><p>women flowed past in an endless procession, </p><p>propelled back and forth through the heart </p><p>of the city. Cars honked beyond the curb, </p><p>traffic congested and moved again as the </p><p>bell rang and the lights changed. No one </p><p>paid him the least attention, he, who had </p><p>been so sure a few minutes before that this </p><p>strange, restless, congested mass of human </p><p>beings should know him and acclaim him. </p><p>Now he was one of them again an un- </p><p>known in a mass of unknowns; just a cor- </p><p>puscle in the veins of the city. He felt he </p><p>would never reach the heights of his as- </p><p>piration, never see his rockets flaring against </p><p>the heavens. He must plod, lift and place, </p><p>lift and place again, eight hours a day, six </p><p>days each week fifty-two weeks each year, </p><p>until some day another mannikin would he </p><p>put in his place to carry on the unending </p><p>drudgery of life. </p><p>The paper dropped from his fingers. A </p><p>puff of wind caught, twisted it, and whisked </p><p>it aloft, high above the heads of the indus- </p><p>trious mass, then let it fall into the streets </p><p>where it scudded along under the shuffling </p><p>feet of the unseeing horde. It lay there, </p><p>restless with each new gust shaken but un- </p><p>able to rise again. </p><p>Staring at that paper with its warrant </p><p>against his dreams, he remembered Freud </p><p>and the psychology of grandeur and dreams. </p><p>Like a good many other men of imagina- </p><p>tion, he had believed in his luck, in his al-</p><p>lotment to play a major part in the scheme </p><p>of things; felt, somehow, that he was a </p><p>man born to walk among the mighty. </p><p>THE SATELLITE OF DOOM </p><p>781 </p><p>_He shrugged his shoulders in an attempt </p><p>to be resigned. </p><p>“Rothberg disappears!” Up and down </p><p>the street newsboys cried his doom; cried it </p><p>lustily with a trill of elation for the pennies </p><p>they were getting. “Big banker disap- </p><p>pears!” </p><p>Pennies, pennies for lollypops or tops, </p><p>or, what did it matter, the big news they </p><p>had not at all. </p><p>He turned back and unlocked the door, </p><p>crossed his room and caught his image in </p><p>the mirror. He was astonished at the ap- </p><p>parent change in himself. The evidence of </p><p>defeat in his features whipped him to a </p><p>new determination. He would fight on! </p><p>He drew his shoulders erect and grinned. </p><p>The wrinkles caused by the laugh looked </p><p>odd against his ashy face. He sat down </p><p>upon his bed. </p><p>Thoughts chased each other around in </p><p>endless procession. The hands of the tiny </p><p>clock upon the table crawled around the di- </p><p>al. The telephone bell against the wall </p><p>tinkled. Now that he noticed it, he believed </p><p>it had been ringing a long time. He lifted </p><p>the receiver and answered in a voice that </p><p>was thin and hollow. </p><p>“Mr. Peterson?” a girl asked. </p><p>“Yes. Who are you?” </p><p>“You don’t know me by name. I took </p><p>the notes for the conference the night your </p><p>plan was adopted.” </p><p>“Yes, yes. Certainly I remember you.” </p><p>“Please come out here just as soon as </p><p>you can. Everything depends on it." </p><p>“All right. I’m coming,” Clifford an- </p><p>swered, wondering at the calmness of his </p><p>voice. “Are you at the Rothberg place?” </p><p>There was no answer. </p><p>He fumbled in the directory for Roth- </p><p>berg’s phone and found it was not listed. </p><p>For the life of him he could not remember</p><p>the number. He asked information but she </p><p>refused to give it to him. </p><p>Uneasiness grew the more he was balked, </p><p>but there was nothing he could do only </p><p>hurry as fast as possible to the Rothberg </p><p>place. </p><p>He caught the elevator, rushed into the </p><p>street to hail a taxi. </p><p>Crowds were swarming about the walls </p><p>which enclosed the estate when the taxi </p><p>drew up at the curb. Beyond the walls all </p><p>seemed quiet enough, and there was little </p><p>to indicate possible tragedy, except two </p><p>stolid men in uniform at each side of the </p><p>front steps, and a few brisk men entering </p><p>and departing. </p><p>Just as he left the cab. Briggs came down </p><p>the walk. </p><p>“The ’ ery man I wanted to see,” his big </p><p>booming voice stopping any attempt to </p><p>evade him. </p><p>BRIGGS was die last man Clifford want- </p><p>ed to see but he followed him into the </p><p>house. In the board room Briggs closed </p><p>the door and turned on him. </p><p>“Of course you've heard.” </p><p>“Yes,” Clifford admitted, watching him </p><p>intently. </p><p>“The old man must have known he was </p><p>in danger,” Briggs went on. “Yesterday he </p><p>asked me to carry on this work should any- </p><p>thing happen to him. ToM me he wanted </p><p>the ship to be a monument to him.” </p><p>“Yes,” Clifford assented absently, think- </p><p>ing of this new puzzle. Why was Briggs </p><p>telling him this? Was he really going ahead </p><p>and launch the ship? If so, that indicated </p><p>he must have nothing at all to do with </p><p>Rothberg’s disappearance. Then who did? </p><p>As he stood thoughtfully wondering </p><p>about the new phase of the situation, Briggs </p><p>turned on him aggressively. </p><p>“Peterson, you’ve no business out here. </p><p>I want you to let this affair alone.” </p><p>“All right,” Clifford agreed coolly, “I </p><p>will when I find what became of Mr. Roth- </p><p>berg.” </p><p>“Better not meddle,” Briggs growled, </p><p>“After all your ship is all that interests </p><p>you.” </p><p>“I don’t like your tone, Briggs,” Clifford </p><p>said. </p><p>“You’ll like it a sight less if you meddle </p><p>here.” </p><p>“I’m not meddling,” Clifford answered </p><p>becoming more irritated. “I had a reason </p><p>to come here.” </p><p>“Yeah, 1 know. She phoned you. I’m </p><p>onto her game too. Now, you get this </p><p>----A </p><p>782 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>straight. If you love your life you stay </p><p>out of this.” </p><p>“Is that a threat?” </p><p>“That or a promise, take it as you </p><p>choose.” </p><p>Briggs hunched his shoulders and doubled </p><p>his fists. Clifford didn’t want to have a </p><p>knock-down fight in the man’s own home, </p><p>so he turned his back and strode from the </p><p>room. He smiled a little, his sense of hu- </p><p>mor saving the situation. Surely Briggs </p><p>ought to know he was no match for him </p><p>that way. </p><p>“Get out then,” Briggs called angrily, </p><p>“and keep away from Crystal. When I want </p><p>you I’ll get you, remember that.” </p><p>Clifford went into the hall wondering at </p><p>Briggs’ jealousy over the girl. She did not </p><p>appear to be the type who would put her- </p><p>self into Briggs' power nor one who would </p><p>carry on an affair with him. </p><p>In the hall he found her waiting for him </p><p>and a big load of worry left his mind. </p><p>The tragedy in the house seemed to make </p><p>her more reserved. There was a touch of </p><p>somberness in her dark coat suit and Clif- </p><p>ford missed the flashes of color she had </p><p>worn at her neck and waist. He wondered </p><p>if this overtone of black was her usual </p><p>business habit or if it hinted that she be- </p><p>lieved Rothberg dead. </p><p>She did not smile, though there was an </p><p>evident relief in her face when she saw him. </p><p>“I’m so glad you came,” she said. </p><p>“I hurried,” he answered taking her hand, </p><p>“You hung up so abruptly I was really </p><p>worried.” </p><p>“Let’s talk, in my little office,” she inter- </p><p>rupted quickly. </p><p>“Wherever you wish,” he agreed. </p><p>He followed down the hall and found </p><p>himself in a small room fitted with steno- </p><p>grapher’s desk, a filing cabinet, and two</p><p>chairs. She seated herself at the desk and </p><p>he sank into the other chair, which was </p><p>evidently the one Rothberg used while dic- </p><p>tating. </p><p>“I'm not the regular secretary,” she said </p><p>briefly, “but I do most of bis personal let- </p><p>ters. He can trust me better than anyone </p><p>else. </p><p>CHAPTER III. </p><p>A Dangerous Situation </p><p>CLIFFORD noticed that she did not call </p><p>Rothberg’s name. Evidently it would </p><p>have been a task for her to mention it just </p><p>then. Certainly he and she were very close </p><p>to each other. W ell. Roll berg had excel- </p><p>lent taste and he did not blame him for </p><p>hiring her. He did wonder though, just </p><p>how much she cared for die millionaire and </p><p>how much for his money. Then he put that </p><p>thought from his mind. He felt it was un- </p><p>just to her. Whatever her connection with </p><p>the banker, he felt it must be sincere and </p><p>unaffected by his wealth. </p><p>“About the phone,” she reminded him, </p><p>“That was queer. Your voice was cut off </p><p>like something or someone had cut the </p><p>wire. I tried to get central again and she </p><p>would not answer. Then I went upstairs </p><p>and that phone was dead too.” </p><p>“Aren’t there other phones about the </p><p>place?” </p><p>“Yes, one in BB's laboratory and one in </p><p>the servants’ quarters.” </p><p>“Did you try either of them?” </p><p>“No—” she hesitated, “Truth is. I didn’t </p><p>want the servants to know. I started down </p><p>to BB’s laboratory and something seemed </p><p>to hold me back. I don’t like to acknowl- </p><p>edge it, really it’s silly, but something </p><p>seemed to warn me to stay out of there. I </p><p>don't know why I felt like that, Maybe it </p><p>was because BB acts so queer of late.” </p><p>Clifford got out of his chair. “I’ll go </p><p>down and find what’s wrong.” </p><p>"No,” she cried, “You must not.” </p><p>“Why?” he asked hesitating. </p><p>“BB. He’ll do anything now. He even</p><p>puts his own guards at my door.” </p><p>“Mr. Rothberg will rip him inside out </p><p>when he conies back.” </p><p>“Oh I do wish he'd come back. 1 am ter- </p><p>ribly worried about him.” </p><p>“No one would dare harm him,’’ Clif- </p><p>ford assured her, though he was not quite </p><p>so sure himself. “He is probably kidnapped </p><p>to delay launching the ship.” </p><p>“Maybe that is all, but BB acts so </p><p>strange. He dares things he never dared </p><p>THE SATELLITE OF DOOM </p><p>&lt;* 783 </p><p>before. He threatens me in a way which </p><p>makes me really afraid.” </p><p>“You think—Briggs killed him?” </p><p>She winced, paled slightly and then said, </p><p>“BB resented the outlay from that first </p><p>night. Last night when they were together </p><p>in here he told BB he would spend his en- </p><p>tire fortune or make a go of the satellites. </p><p>BB agreed with him, but too readily. I </p><p>know now I should have done something.” </p><p>She stopped talking and her head bent </p><p>forward to hide her face. It was plain she </p><p>was losing her magnificent control, but af- </p><p>ter a moment she went on: “That was the </p><p>last time anyone saw him. They went down </p><p>into the laboratory to look over the ship. </p><p>This morning the butler told the police </p><p>that he had seen him go into the street </p><p>about nine o’clock last night, but I believe </p><p>he is lying.” </p><p>“Have you told anyone what you sus- </p><p>pect?” </p><p>“There was no one I could trust.” </p><p>“If the butler is lying, Mr. Rothberg must </p><p>still be down in the laboratory!” </p><p>“Yes, somewhere down there.” </p><p>“Then w’hy was he not found?” he ex- </p><p>claimed. </p><p>“You don’t know BB,” she said with a </p><p>pronounced agitation. “He has drugs and </p><p>chemicals which will do unbelievable </p><p>things!” </p><p>“I don’t like to leave you alone,” he said </p><p>with evident concern as he got out of his </p><p>chair, “but Mr. Rothberg may need help. </p><p>I’ll be right back.” </p><p>“Don’t go down there alone,” she warned </p><p>and lowered her voice as though she sus- </p><p>pected someone was listening. “Not the lab- </p><p>oratory! You’d be at his mercy.” </p><p>HER concern thrilled him. He let his </p><p>eyes linger on her, watched her black </p><p>pupils grow wider and wider. Puzzled at </p><p>the way he affected her, and then with some</p><p>chagrin he saw that her eyes were not upon </p><p>him but that she was looking over his shoul- </p><p>der at something behind him; that her eyes </p><p>were not widening with love but with ter- </p><p>ror. </p><p>He whirled about quickly and found </p><p>Briggs peering through the partly opened </p><p>door. Clifford gave him one disdainful </p><p>glance and deliberately turned his back. </p><p>The girl pulled at the hem of her short </p><p>skirt and toyed carelessly with a paper cut- </p><p>ter. </p><p>Clifford was sorry for her. Briggs was </p><p>using his position in the home to act a </p><p>beast, </p><p>“I hear the ship is ready to launch.” </p><p>Clifford said the first thing that came into </p><p>his mind, anything to divert Briggs from </p><p>the girl. </p><p>“Tomorrow,” Briggs declared and his </p><p>tone was defiant as though he expected Clif- </p><p>ford to object. </p><p>“Don't we wait for Rothberg?” Clifford </p><p>demanded. </p><p>Briggs stepped forward until he towered </p><p>over Clifford who leaned upon the desk. </p><p>“Tomorrow, I said,” he snarled: “Not a </p><p>day later!” </p><p>“Then it is ready?” Clifford asked, his </p><p>nerves tightening, “May I see it, Briggs?” </p><p>Briggs regarded him with an uncertain </p><p>suspicion, then seemed to arrive at a deci- </p><p>sion and turned toward the door. </p><p>“Come on,” he growled. </p><p>Clifford followed but felt the girl’s hand </p><p>upon his sleeve. </p><p>Briggs whirled and there was a danger- </p><p>ous fire in his eyes. </p><p>“Get on,” Clifford commanded. Briggs </p><p>shot a threat over his shoulder and then </p><p>went striding down the hall. </p><p>Jn all the months that Clifford had </p><p>worked with Rothberg and Briggs correct-</p><p>ing flaws and inventing schemes for im- </p><p>proving the ship, he had been refused a </p><p>glimpse of the work. Briggs had insisted </p><p>on keeping him out of the laboratory and </p><p>his whole knowledge of the ship’s progress </p><p>was obtained from blue prints and small </p><p>models. So when Briggs opened the door of </p><p>the shop and went down a short flight of </p><p>stairs, Clifford peered eagerly over the maze </p><p>of pipes, machinery and belts, to rest upon </p><p>the ship which was near the rear of the </p><p>building. </p><p>She was indeed an engaging vessel. Night </p><p>was just settling and the soft radiance of </p><p>her luminous paint glowed against the </p><p>shadowed walls. Clifford knew then why </p><p>784 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>Rothberg had planned to send her out at </p><p>night. She would make a spectacular de- </p><p>parture! </p><p>- “All loaded and ready for contact,” </p><p>Briggs rumbled as he pressed a button. </p><p>The wall beyond seemed to resolve itself </p><p>into great doors which slid open to provide </p><p>a hole large enough for the exit of the two- </p><p>hundred foot torpedo-shaped ship. New </p><p>track gleamed below the ship and ran out </p><p>into the trial yard. </p><p>“We’ll make ihe experiment here. The </p><p>first the world shall know of it will be the </p><p>flash of light as it shoots across the heavens </p><p>to circle the earth! ” </p><p>“I hope it does, Briggs. It would ruin </p><p>me should it fall.” </p><p>“You said it couldn’t,” Briggs exclaimed </p><p>hoarsely and stared at him in astonish- </p><p>ment. </p><p>“That’s my theory, Briggs. Only the ex- </p><p>periment will tell for sure.” </p><p>“It mustn’t,” Briggs raved, his whole at- </p><p>titude showing unparalleled concern. “I </p><p>won’t fire it if it’s likely to fail. I’ll have </p><p>her dragged to the river and sunk first.” </p><p>Trapped! </p><p>&lt;4T didn’t mean to intimate that we would </p><p>A fail, Briggs. Of course we won’t give </p><p>up even if this one doesn’t take off. In that </p><p>case we would have to tear her up and find </p><p>what was wrong, then try again.” </p><p>“No,” Briggs declared, staring at the </p><p>floor. “I’ll have her drowned. We’d be the </p><p>laughing stock of the whole world.” </p><p>He jabbed at the switch and ihe doors </p><p>closed. He turned and gave Clifford a </p><p>quick, searching look, crafty with some hid- </p><p>den anxiety. </p><p>“Peterson,” he finally said, “You’ve a fu- </p><p>ture ahead of you. You have already de- </p><p>vised some things which should make you </p><p>famous when they are widely known.”</p><p>He lowered his voice and gave a cautious </p><p>glance around the dimly lighted room. </p><p>Clifford was annoyed. Why was the man </p><p>whispering. There seemed to be no one </p><p>down there to hear him even had he shout- </p><p>ed. </p><p>“I’ve made a discovery or two, myself,” </p><p>Briggs went on, “Something deep. Some- </p><p>thing which has to do with the basic laws </p><p>of life!” </p><p>“No?” </p><p>“Sure.” </p><p>Clifford was instantly alert. Here seemed </p><p>to be a chance to get Briggs to talk. He </p><p>was anxious to find out how sane the blaz- </p><p>ing-eyed chemist was. </p><p>“What have you discovered?” he asked. </p><p>“Shhh! Not so loud. It’s a secret. I have- </p><p>n’t even told the governor. Not a soul. </p><p>But I’ll tell you ” </p><p>Clifford stiffened expectantly and after </p><p>a moment Briggs went on. </p><p>“Of course you’ll admit that life is no </p><p>more than chemical action.” </p><p>“No, I don’t,’’ Clifford objected mainly </p><p>to draw him out. </p><p>“You don’t know that?” Briggs ques- </p><p>tioned fretfully. </p><p>“Oh, I’ll admit the physical part of life </p><p>is chemical,” Clifford said soothingly watch- </p><p>ing Briggs closely. “But there is more to </p><p>life than the oxidation which takes place </p><p>in the body. What about intelligence? Spi- </p><p>rit, if you please? We chemists can make a </p><p>particle of matter wiggle, whistle, sing and </p><p>even talk, but we have never made it feel </p><p>or think!” </p><p>“Of course,” Briggs drawled absently, </p><p>"But it is the chemical part of life I am </p><p>experimenting with.” </p><p>The glitter in his black eyes was now </p><p>more metallic. “I have discovered how to </p><p>produce flesh, live flesh, Peterson!”</p><p>Clifford clenched his hands and stared </p><p>at the cement floor. He could not trust </p><p>himself to look at Briggs a moment longer. </p><p>He fell sure then that he was on the trail </p><p>of Rothberg. dead or alive. </p><p>Briggs droned on, “In my vault I have </p><p>something that will interest you; made of </p><p>minerals and treated with chemicals: flesh! </p><p>Human flesh, and it bleeds!” </p><p>Clifford had 110 doubt by that time that </p><p>Briggs was entirely mad, and that he had </p><p>either killed Rothberg outright or was us- </p><p>ing him for some horrible experiment. He </p><p>did not know whether to answer or remain </p><p>silent. One bit too much interest might </p><p>scare Briggs and one bit less might stop </p><p>THE SATELLITE OF DOOM </p><p>785 </p><p>the wild ramblings. Briggs hesitated and </p><p>Clifford said, “You’re a wizard if you can </p><p>do that.” </p><p>He wondered if Briggs noticed the strain </p><p>in his voice. </p><p>“I’ve done it!” Briggs flared. </p><p>“Science asks proof.” </p><p>“You want to see it,” the crafty anxiety </p><p>was growing in the black eyes. “Come on, </p><p>I’ll give you a look.” </p><p>Briggs strode off down a lane between the </p><p>machinery and Clifford followed him close- </p><p>ly, hoping that he would find Rothberg </p><p>alive. </p><p>They reached a large vault of masonry </p><p>and steel. Briggs swung open the door and </p><p>stepped inside, Clifford close at his heels. </p><p>Briggs turned on an electric light. </p><p>“There!” he cackled, pointing to a glass </p><p>case at the far end of the ten-foot vault. </p><p>Clifford gasped. </p><p>In the long glass case was something </p><p>which might have been a man. It was nude, </p><p>terribly bloodsoaked and lacerated. </p><p>ROTHBERG? With two quick strides he </p><p>reached the case and peered in. The </p><p>body proved to be nothing more than a </p><p>mannikin of flesh-colored rubber, daubed </p><p>here and there with red paint. He whirled </p><p>around sensing a trap. Briggs was gone </p><p>and the big steel door of the vault was </p><p>closing! Briggs had been too keen for </p><p>him! </p><p>He stepped back and regarded the gray </p><p>steel bolts of the door as they glistened un- </p><p>der the light. He knew the strength of that </p><p>chrome steel. The inch thick tusks were </p><p>shot solidly into the frame and there was </p><p>no way on earth he could drive them back. </p><p>He was chagrined at how easily he had </p><p>been duped, even with the warning the girl </p><p>had given him. Truth was, he had not be- </p><p>lieved Briggs was quite so diabolical and</p><p>vicious as she seemed to think. Now it </p><p>proved she had been quite right and he was </p><p>too late in realizing it. </p><p>Hardly hoping for any means of escape, </p><p>he searched around the small room. There </p><p>was a lot of chemical apparatus on the ta- </p><p>ble, and the walls were lined with steel </p><p>shelves fitted with filing boxes. </p><p>Clifford pulled down one of the files. </p><p>It was heavy. He opened it. Inside were </p><p>typewritten manuscripts and blue prints; </p><p>scientific stuff, the records of experiments </p><p>which Rothberg had financed. </p><p>No doubt the records of his own scheme </p><p>were here and he went carefully through the </p><p>file hoping to find them and get them away </p><p>from Briggs, should he by any chance leave </p><p>the vault alive. </p><p>The first file finished he took down an- </p><p>other. and as he searched he stacked the </p><p>boxes carefully upon the floor. Back of </p><p>the eighth box was a small round hole in </p><p>the masonry of the wall. He was complete- </p><p>ly surprised at finding it. </p><p>Mice? Certainly not. </p><p>He stepped upon one of the steel boxes </p><p>to peer closer, and saw that the hole was the </p><p>end of a galvanized pipe, cut flush with the </p><p>surface of the wall. </p><p>That was queer. Why should a pipe be </p><p>run into this vault and hidden behind the </p><p>filing boxes? </p><p>Wondering about it he rummaged through </p><p>the papers in the ninth box and started on </p><p>the tenth. </p><p>He smelled gas. Instantly he knew his </p><p>peril. This was Briggs’ way of getting rid </p><p>of him 1 It was also probably the way Roth- </p><p>berg had been dispatched. </p><p>The gas fumes hissed through the pipe. </p><p>It would not take long to finish him at that </p><p>rate. He took out his handkerchief to plug </p><p>the hole. But that would never do. He </p><p>knew Briggs well enough to know that plug- </p><p>ging the hole would not beat him. Briggs </p><p>would take no chances with any escape as </p><p>simple as that. In whatever room he had </p><p>his gas lever would be a meter that would</p><p>gauge the amount of gas entering the vault. </p><p>Should he plug the hole Briggs would be </p><p>warned and leave him to starve or would </p><p>devise some other way to finish him. </p><p>Clifford knew if he were to get out alive </p><p>he would have to do better than just plug </p><p>the pipe. He would have to let gas flow </p><p>into the vault. Let Briggs believe he was </p><p>suffocated; and then surprise him as he </p><p>opened the door to drag out his body. But </p><p>how? Already he 'vas dizzy with the fumes. </p><p>There was a way and he thought of it! </p><p>7S6 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>A desperate method which gave small hope, </p><p>but he was in a desperate situation. </p><p>He struck a match and threw it at the </p><p>hole. The gas burst into flame, leaping far </p><p>into the vault and singeing his hair. Then </p><p>it shrank to the pipe and burned in a long </p><p>tongue of roaring fire. On and on it burned. </p><p>The acrid fumes became less pungent, but </p><p>the air of the vault grew hot and stifling. </p><p>He stood helplessly and stared at the </p><p>hissing blaze, and tried to devise some way </p><p>to prevent its eating up the air he needed </p><p>for his gasping lungs. </p><p>CHAPTER IV. </p><p>Into the Sky! </p><p>riE vault became hotter and hotter. He </p><p>suffocated, his throat seemed parched </p><p>with fire. He decided it would be better to </p><p>die by cool gas than by blazing fire. He </p><p>groped about the vault searching dizzily </p><p>for something with which to smother the </p><p>flame, and as he searched be remembered </p><p>his coming hour of triumph but one day </p><p>ahead. God, how he wanted to live long </p><p>enough to launch the ship; to watch il race </p><p>out into the orbit of its service to the earth. </p><p>He wanted to protect that strange girl up- </p><p>stairs—he wanted—he wanted—what? Air </p><p>—just air. </p><p>He reeled sank to the floor. The llame </p><p>above burned on, riding high about the </p><p>mouth of the pipe, higher and higher as </p><p>though it were breaking loose from its an- </p><p>chor and trying to float away. Up and down </p><p>il crept as it fed on stagnant air currents </p><p>from the floor. And Clifford knew what </p><p>made it ride away from the pipe. The oxy- </p><p>gen in the air was growing thin. </p><p>Black night and red flame played hide </p><p>and seek across his brain. He felt that he </p><p>was slipping down, down, down, into a deep </p><p>dark place, lighted now and then with red </p><p>flares of light. Sprawled upon the floor he </p><p>breathed in a quick pant like a huge lizard </p><p>spread upon a jungle floor. </p><p>Cliflord was not entirely out when there </p><p>came a noise as of someone working at the </p><p>door. The steel tusks moved back from</p><p>their sockets and the door moved. It opened </p><p>wider and a flood of fresh sweet air poured </p><p>in. He breathed greedily and tried to get </p><p>hold of himself. He felt sure Briggs would </p><p>be armed and try to finish him. He rose </p><p>groggily to his knees and doubled his lean </p><p>fists, waiting like a cornered beast. </p><p>A swift figure darted through the half </p><p>open door, seized his shoulders and tugged </p><p>at him. He waved his fists groggily in an </p><p>effort to strike. He heard a faint cry of </p><p>pain and the blackness seemed lo lifl again. </p><p>The girl was there. Somehow she had </p><p>found him. He marvelled at her courage, </p><p>knowing how very much afraid she was to </p><p>be down there. He marvelled still more at </p><p>her concern for him. </p><p>The fresh air braced him like aromatic </p><p>spirits. He got to his feet and leaned </p><p>against the wall. She stepped nearer, her </p><p>gray eyes burning with anxiety. He smiled </p><p>weakly. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m all right,” he assured </p><p>her. </p><p>“I knew he’d try to kill you. That's why </p><p>I begged you not to come down here.” </p><p>“Yes I am dumb, but you rescued me,” </p><p>he said with a bil of chagrin. </p><p>“Not so dumb,” she denied. </p><p>He glanced up to see her eyes regarding </p><p>the flaming jet. The fire trembled in the </p><p>mirror of her eyes. </p><p>“You outwitted him that time, but let’s </p><p>yet out of here,” she added nervously. </p><p>“He'll want nothing better than to lock us </p><p>both in.” </p><p>“Shall I help you,” she asked leaning </p><p>over him. </p><p>“No. I’ll make it. Go ahead.” </p><p>She left the vault and he followed, reel- </p><p>ing a trifle. Outside she slipped around a </p><p>black panel which held electrical switches, </p><p>and then across toward the space ship, </p><p>which glowed with a weird radiance against </p><p>the dark, lifeless room. Here and there a</p><p>night bulb cast grotesque shadows of the </p><p>queer machines upon the concrete floor and </p><p>distorted them against the pale gray walls. </p><p>“He’ll be wild,” she whispered. </p><p>“He’ll never launch the ship now,” he </p><p>said dejectedly. </p><p>THE SATELLITE OF DOOM </p><p>787 </p><p>“Launch it yourself,” she declared. “It’s </p><p>all ready.” </p><p>“Mr. Rothberg?” he questioned. </p><p>Her enthusiasm died. She stood silent </p><p>for a moment and then in a sad, soft tone; </p><p>“I’m sure he’d want you to. I am sure </p><p>of it.” </p><p>“You’re right,” he agreed, “Why wait </p><p>when the test can he made now. I)o you </p><p>know the switches which work the hoist?” </p><p>“Yes,” she said and pressed the button </p><p>which opened the big doors. </p><p>THEY slid back and unfolded a section </p><p>of clear, moonless sky, alight with the </p><p>thousand candles of night. She stepped to </p><p>a row of levers against the wall. </p><p>“Contact!”’ she called like a valiant lit- </p><p>tle soldier. </p><p>The hoist growled. The ship slid out- </p><p>ivard and up along the inclined track, until </p><p>it was high up in the yard outside the labor- </p><p>atory. She pressed another switch and the </p><p>Cable fell away, another and there was a </p><p>burst of flashing, spluttering, roaring flame, </p><p>which howled like a mighty cyclone of </p><p>chemical disintegration. </p><p>The ship heaved upward with constantly </p><p>accelerating velocity. It went streaking </p><p>across the sky with a long tail of fire left </p><p>for an instant in its wake. On and on the </p><p>monster sped. Faster! Faster! It grew </p><p>smaller and smaller into the vastness of the </p><p>heavens. </p><p>Cries came from the streets. Shouts! </p><p>Yells! Questions tossed back and forth, </p><p>man to man. The space ship was setting </p><p>the city on its ears. </p><p>It gained the heavens, glowing like a big </p><p>star. It sped across the zenith against a </p><p>galaxy of ancient stars, moving down to- </p><p>ward the rim of the far horizon. </p><p>Clifford and the girl stood dumb, hum- </p><p>bled with the power man had brought at </p><p>last into his control. Dumb with the great-</p><p>ness of having created something far more </p><p>lasting than themselves. </p><p>Behind them came the sound of running </p><p>feet. </p><p>Clifford turned to see Briggs, who began </p><p>to shout wildly. </p><p>Believing the man was entirely mad he </p><p>reached about for some weapon. But </p><p>Briggs paid little attention to him. </p><p>“Good God!” he was at last understand- </p><p>able. “What have you done? The gover- </p><p>nor’s in there!” </p><p>The girl screamed “No! No! No!” She </p><p>swayed and sank upon the floor, and hud- </p><p>dled there as though strength had gone en- </p><p>tirely out of her. </p><p>Clifford leaned over and laid his arm </p><p>across her shoulders and felt the quiver of </p><p>of her body as she shook with grief. </p><p>“I’m sorry, so sorry,” was all he could </p><p>think to say. </p><p>Briggs hurdled back through the labor- </p><p>atory crying: </p><p>“We’ve got to stop it! We’ve got to stop </p><p>it! The governor’s in there!” </p><p>Clifford knew how useless was that cry. </p><p>That ship was like death. One could launch </p><p>it but there was no known way to bring it </p><p>down. It was in the control of the cos- </p><p>mos! </p><p>“What have 1 done? Oh! what have I </p><p>done?” the girl sobbed brokkenly. </p><p>“We didn’t know,” Clifford said. “We </p><p>had no way of knowing. You and I are not </p><p>to blame. It was Briggs, the scoundrel!” </p><p>His words seemed to shake her with new </p><p>despair. </p><p>“Oh, you don’t understand! You don’t </p><p>know! I am BB’s wife!” </p><p>Clifford straightened with the shock. </p><p>She—BB’s wife? Rothberg’s daughter? </p><p>Why had he not guessed it?”</p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>Brigg’s Story </p><p>LIFFORD had no doubt BB spoke the </p><p>truth. Rothberg must certainly be in </p><p>the steel satellite. Of course they must </p><p>make a desperate effort to get him out—no </p><p>expense or peril would be spared. But un- </p><p>less Briggs had provided some means for </p><p>him to live up there, only the frozen body </p><p>would be their reward, if they succeeded </p><p>at all. Hundreds of miles above the earth </p><p>the ship was as unattainable as though it </p><p>were at the moon or Mars. </p><p>The rockets, of course had been construct- </p><p>788 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>ed to make contact with the hull, and these </p><p>rockets were the first tilings that came into </p><p>Clifford’s mind as he bent over the stricken </p><p>girl. And still they seemed to offer little </p><p>hope. They were to be discharged by gases </p><p>with gradual acceleration, as the ship had </p><p>been, but constructed of only plate steel </p><p>they provided little protection against the </p><p>absolute cold of space (accepting as fact the </p><p>prevailing opinion that the temperature of </p><p>space was minus 273 degrees Centigrade, </p><p>or thereabouts). Even if one could survive </p><p>in a specially constructed rocket the steel </p><p>walls of the ship and the hull of the rocket </p><p>would form a barrier no one knew how to </p><p>pass. </p><p>As Clifford pondered these problems, the </p><p>girl pulled herself together and got to her </p><p>feet. She said something, but Clifford could </p><p>not make it out, for beyond the open doors </p><p>the street and city was aroar. The whole </p><p>town seemed turned upside down. The stri- </p><p>dent honking of auto horns underscored the </p><p>wild shouting of men and boys. The wail </p><p>of distant sirens and the low bellow of fac- </p><p>tory whistles added to make such a bedlam </p><p>as only a startled city can make. </p><p>Clifford pressed the switch and the big </p><p>doors slid together and muffled the clamor </p><p>outside. The girl touched his arm and he </p><p>looked around to see Briggs running back </p><p>from the dim recesses of the laboratory. As </p><p>he came nearer, Clifford thought he detect- </p><p>ed a poorly concealed elation in his bear- </p><p>ing as he barked at them. </p><p>“I told you not to meddle. There is not </p><p>a chance in the world of rescuing him </p><p>alive!” </p><p>Crystal ran down the aisle between the </p><p>grotesque machinery and caught Briggs by </p><p>the arm. </p><p>“BB! What do you mean? Is he still </p><p>alive?” </p><p>“How do I know?” I never sent him off!” </p><p>he evaded brutally. </p><p>“Listen to me!” she cried pulling at him </p><p>with nervous little jerks. “What was he </p><p>doing inside the ship?”</p><p>Briggs did not seem in the least upset. </p><p>His smutty eyes rested upon her slight fig- </p><p>ure with a contemptuous composure that </p><p>seemed to torment her. </p><p>“It won’t do any harm to tell you, now,” </p><p>he finally answered. “The governor and I </p><p>were working on the idea of carrying pas- </p><p>sengers at some time in the future. I dis- </p><p>covered a method of rinsing the carbon from </p><p>respired air, so that it might be breathed </p><p>again; a simple little process that will make </p><p>oxygen tanks unnecessary.” </p><p>“BB!” she cried, tugging at him again, </p><p>“Can you stand there and talk of experi- </p><p>ments at a time like this?” </p><p>“Well, why not?” he resumed and then </p><p>as though she had not interrupted at all, </p><p>“The contraption seemed a success, and to </p><p>prove it, 1 volunteered to let myself be seal- </p><p>ed inside. The old sport refused and in- </p><p>sisted on trying it out himself, and since he </p><p>was boss, I had to let him have his way. </p><p>He was doing splendidly the last peep I got </p><p>at him through the plate glass port hole.” </p><p>“BB!" she cried again, “we’re wasting </p><p>time. Let us all forget everything but him </p><p>and his peril and get together to find some </p><p>way to get him back.” </p><p>“How?” he asked with exasperating </p><p>doubt in his tone. “All hell can t bring </p><p>down that ship now!” </p><p>“How?” she repeated mechanically and </p><p>looked at Clifford. </p><p>“The mail rockets,” he answered, not be- </p><p>cause he knew a way, but because he wanted </p><p>to give her hope. </p><p>RIGGS laughed ironically. </p><p>Crystal whirled on hrai and Clifford </p><p>thought she was going to attack him with </p><p>her small strength. Instead she caught his </p><p>arm again, then let it go. She shrank </p><p>away covering her face in the bend of her </p><p>white elbow. </p><p>“You planned it,” she whimpered, “You </p><p>didn’t care what became of him just so you </p><p>got him out of your way. Oh, BB how </p><p>could you?” </p><p>Briggs remained stiffly composed. </p><p>“Cut out that sob stuff,” he snapped, “I </p><p>told you not to meddle, and this is what </p><p>you get?” </p><p>She straightened and her arm came down </p><p>from her face and held stiffly at her side. </p><p>Clifford saw that her hand was clenched </p><p>tightly. She faced Briggs as though a wall </p><p>THE SATELLITE OF DOOM </p><p>789 </p><p>was at her back and she was determined </p><p>to be brave. </p><p>“BB.” she said slowly, “We would have </p><p>loved you and given you all that you de- </p><p>sired if you had let us. Daddy knew what </p><p>he was about. He made his fortune by see- </p><p>ing opportunities before any one else saw </p><p>them, and yet, you were so afraid he'd lose </p><p>what he had, you-—killed him!” </p><p>Briggs eyes opened slightly and then con- </p><p>tracted. He shifted them from the daunt- </p><p>less little figure and glared at Clifford. </p><p>Then he looked back again and growled. </p><p>“If you ever want to see him again, get </p><p>busy and quit trying to put the blame onto </p><p>me.” </p><p>“Yes, BB,” she agreed, “Give me some- </p><p>thing to do!” </p><p>“Get Marks on the phone. Ask him to </p><p>come down here. Phone Shaffer to roust </p><p>out a crew for the shops. I’ll build a spec- </p><p>ial rocket and go up after him myself. Cut </p><p>him out with a fusing rod and oxygen flame. </p><p>Now get hold of yourself and help undo </p><p>what you have done.” </p><p>He turned on Clifford again. “You get </p><p>out of here!” </p><p>Clifford stood his ground and stared at </p><p>him, with a hard glaze upon his eyes. </p><p>“Are you going or shall I have you </p><p>thrown in the hoosegow?” </p><p>Clifford boiled. How he wanted to paste </p><p>Briggs one on his curling lips. But he </p><p>knew that would not do. If Briggs had </p><p>him arrested on any pretext whatever he </p><p>would be unable to form any plan of res- </p><p>cue, so he walked away slowly, despising </p><p>himself for being in a position that Briggs </p><p>could bluff him. </p><p>Before he left the laboratory he heard </p><p>the girl call for Marks. Briggs flooded the </p><p>place with light as he reached the stairs </p><p>and the buzz of machinery began vibrating </p><p>over the room. </p><p>He left the dark house wondering why </p><p>Briggs had gone to work so quickly to try </p><p>effect a rescue. Did he have some sinister </p><p>plan of his own in wanting to be the first </p><p>to reach the ship? </p><p>Out into the street he found it swarming </p><p>with people who rushed here and there and </p><p>tossed every kind of a rumor about. He </p><p>lighted a cigarette and leaned heavily </p><p>against the gate. With his mind busy with </p><p>the stupendous problem confronting him he </p><p>tried to devise some means of rescue as </p><p>an hour passed and then another. </p><p>A dim star rose above the horizon and </p><p>mounted swiftly toward the zenith, moving </p><p>agianst a galaxy of ancient stars. The </p><p>ship! The newest satellite of the universe! </p><p>While he had been standing there he knew </p><p>it had crossed the Atlantic, met the sun and </p><p>the broad light of day over the cities and </p><p>villages of Europe and Asia, crossed the </p><p>day and night areas of the Pacific, the </p><p>Western Coast of the United States, the </p><p>Rockies, the Middle Western States, and </p><p>was now racing toward the Atlantic coast </p><p>again! </p><p>Speed! Could man never find its limit? </p><p>Forever and forever that ship would be </p><p>on time, even when the earth had grown </p><p>ancient and old and tottered in its orbit </p><p>like a drunken top, it would race on and </p><p>on. Earth folks hailed it now with the </p><p>same joy they hailed every new discovery, </p><p>but in a day or two the miracle would be- </p><p>come commonplace, and men would think it </p><p>undignified to pull back their heads to re- </p><p>gard its meteorlike flight. </p><p>He knew he was fortunate. It was given </p><p>to few men to both dream and accomplish. </p><p>Yet the glory of his triumph was gone by </p><p>the thought of Rothberg sealed inside die </p><p>ship. As far as rescue was concerned he </p><p>might just as well have been stranded on </p><p>the moon. </p><p>Desperate Plans </p><p>CLIFFORD did not trust Briggs for an </p><p>instant. If Rothberg went into that </p><p>ship voluntarily why had he not first sub- </p><p>mitted the plan to his board of scientists? </p><p>Or at least taken his daughter into his con-</p><p>fidence before submitting himself wholly </p><p>to Briggs’ power. </p><p>With the vague idea of asking the girl </p><p>to hinder rather than help Briggs with the </p><p>rocket, he turned back to the house and </p><p>found the front door partly open, as he had </p><p>left it. It seemed that servants, and every- </p><p>one else, were too upset to carry on the reg- </p><p>790 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>ular routine of life. He threaded his way </p><p>through the dimly lighted hall and on back </p><p>to the laboratory. </p><p>Briggs and Crystal were at a desk under </p><p>an electric light. Before them were papers </p><p>and blueprints. Briggs saw him and </p><p>scowled. The girl did not look up until he </p><p>stood beside them, then she said bravely. </p><p>“BB’s great. He has planned a vacuum </p><p>tube rocket which shall be warmed chemi- </p><p>cally and supplied with oxygen from tanks!” </p><p>“How is he going to do any good sealed </p><p>inside the tube?” Clifford asked. </p><p>“Meddling again,” Briggs growled. </p><p>“Not meddling. I have a sincere inter- </p><p>est in rescuing Rothberg, you know that.” </p><p>“Oh, yes, 1 know that. You’ve been </p><p>spending a lot of his jack of late.” </p><p>“BB!” Crystal exclaimed, “I thought we </p><p>were all to work together!” </p><p>Briggs put down some figures in a small </p><p>cramped hand. Clifford watched him. </p><p>“What are you going to do when you get </p><p>there?” Crystal asked Briggs. </p><p>“The devil!” he exploded, “One thing at </p><p>a time. You two won’t give me a chance </p><p>to think.” He let his pencil drop to the </p><p>table. “If it will make you any easier, I’ll </p><p>tell you that the warm rocket is to be only </p><p>a refuge. I go out for a few minutes and </p><p>work swiftly and return when the cold be- </p><p>comes unbearable.” </p><p>“You know you can’t do that!” Clifford </p><p>objected. “You know that scientists be- </p><p>lieve that space has a temperature of minus </p><p>two hundred and seventy-three degrees Cen- </p><p>tigrade.” </p><p>“Applesauce,” Briggs growled. “Scien- </p><p>tists now believe, at least some of them do, </p><p>that space is not much colder than the arc- </p><p>tic zone in wintertime, possibly not more </p><p>than fifty degrees minus. I think they are </p><p>right too!” </p><p>“Maybe,” Clifford agreed, “but what will </p><p>happen should you be wrong?” </p><p>He glanced at the girl for approval, but </p><p>she frowned. Evidently she thought he was </p><p>trying to discourage Briggs. Clifford did </p><p>want to discourage him for he did not trust </p><p>him at all, so he asked in spite of her dis- </p><p>tress : “Do you have any idea how cold </p><p>minus two hundred and seventy-three de- </p><p>grees is, Mrs. Briggs?” </p><p>“No,” she said with despair in her eyes. </p><p>“Perhaps 1 can give you an idea. I saw </p><p>a rubber ball dropped into a basin of liq- </p><p>uid air once. You know liquid air is much </p><p>warmer than absolute zero. When I recov- </p><p>ered the rubber and dropped it, it shattered </p><p>like rotten glass!” </p><p>“Then there is no hope?” she asked, her </p><p>eyes begging for encouragement. </p><p>“There has to be,” he said emphatically, </p><p>“but to have hope one must be fortified </p><p>against such temperatures, if one intends to </p><p>leave the rocket.” </p><p>“I’ll manage that,” Briggs growled. </p><p>“How?” Clifford insisted. </p><p>Briggs pushed back his sketches and </p><p>glared. </p><p>“Didn’t I tell you to keep out of this. </p><p>Now, get this straight, we don’t need your </p><p>help!” </p><p>Clifford looked straight at Crystal ex- </p><p>pecting her to deny that Briggs was auth- </p><p>orized to speak for her father, but she sat </p><p>very silent and stared at the paper as </p><p>though she wished he would go. Feeling </p><p>uncomfortable he turned and left the labora- </p><p>tory, wondering whether she really wanted </p><p>him to go or not. He was still determined </p><p>to go ahead with plans of his own, regard- </p><p>less of whether they were appreciated or </p><p>not. </p><p>HE took a taxi and sped to the Univer- </p><p>sity and called Professor Mullin from </p><p>his class hall. </p><p>“Professor,” he began before Mullin was </p><p>within ten feet of him, “Did you know Roth- </p><p>berg is in that ship?” </p><p>“What? Not the satellite?” </p><p>“Yes and probably suffocating by now. </p><p>I’ll tell you how he got there later, but </p><p>right now I want your help to get him out!” </p><p>“My! My!” the Professor ejaculated, </p><p>“A very desperate situation.” </p><p>He drew his head back and looked sky- </p><p>ward as though looking for proof of that </p><p>which he had heard. </p><p>“We haven’t a minute to lose,” Clifford </p><p>continued. </p><p>“But we can’t do anything at all,” Mul- </p><p>THE SATELLITE OF DOOM </p><p>791 </p><p>lin exclaimed with widening eyes. “It will </p><p>require years, maybe centuries of experi- </p><p>ment to solve such a problem! Are you </p><p>sure he is in the ship?” </p><p>“Not sure, professor, but I intend to go </p><p>up and look it over.’’ </p><p>“Go up? How?” </p><p>“The mail rockets!” </p><p>“But—” </p><p>“Yes, and that is why I need your help </p><p>and that of the Board. We must construct </p><p>a rocket at once, one with special features </p><p>so that one may live to make the trip up </p><p>and back.” </p><p>“But, my boy, no one could take him out </p><p>of the satellite. Open the port hole and </p><p>the pressure of air inside would hurl him </p><p>out to be frozen and lost in space! That </p><p>chamber was sealed at sea level and con- </p><p>tains a pressure of fifteen pounds to the </p><p>square inch! More than a ton to the square </p><p>foot! You’d never find his body after- </p><p>wards, even with a telescope!” </p><p>“1 know,” Clifford answered calmly, </p><p>“That is just what I have been worrying </p><p>about. One can’t go about rescue that way, </p><p>and still Briggs is at work trying to do that </p><p>very thing! I really believe he is trying </p><p>to finish Rothberg to save his own hide.” </p><p>“What are you talking about?” Professor </p><p>Mullin asked puzzled. “Be plain and don’t </p><p>get excited. “Let's go over there and sit </p><p>down and you can tell me all you know.” </p><p>“Very well,” Clifford agreed. He knew </p><p>there was no time to be lost if Rothberg </p><p>was to be rescued alive, but he knew too </p><p>that he must explain fully if he expected </p><p>Mullin’s help. </p><p>. He followed the tall figure of the pro- </p><p>fessor across to a stone bench and stood </p><p>while Mullin seated himself. Then with </p><p>one foot on the bench and his fingers work- </p><p>ing impatiently, he told him all that had </p><p>happened the night before. </p><p>“So Briggs tried to gas you, eh? Well, </p><p>well well. I’m really not surprised. A</p><p>short-sighted man and a dangerous one. </p><p>He loves money, but he shuts it up too </p><p>tight to let it grow. I suspected he was </p><p>anxious for Rothberg to die, but f never </p><p>thought he’d murder him.” </p><p>Mullin rose abruptly. “We must get </p><p>busy. Briggs is already hours ahead of us. </p><p>Wait here a minute. I’ll run back to the </p><p>office and phone Marks and call the board </p><p>together.” </p><p>Clifford watched the tall, dignified man </p><p>do his first sprint in years. He waited, his </p><p>mind racing through calculations, devising </p><p>and rejecting plans for the new rocket. </p><p>When Professor Mullin came back, the talk </p><p>with Marks and the other members of the </p><p>board seemed to have influenced him a good </p><p>deal. </p><p>“Marks has absolute faith in Briggs and </p><p>his rocket,” he said soberly, “And the Board </p><p>has not only expressed faith in him but an </p><p>admiration for his willingness to risk his </p><p>life going up.” </p><p>“I'd advise you to go over the thing with </p><p>Crystal. She knows a good deal about </p><p>Briggs and is rather keen on what her fath- </p><p>er might wish to be done?” </p><p>A little exasperated with Professor Mul- </p><p>lin he left and went again to the Rothberg </p><p>place, but she was not at home, at least to </p><p>him. There were two strange guards at the </p><p>gate who followed him to the street gate </p><p>when he was refused admittance. </p><p>CHAPTER VI </p><p>An Urgent Message </p><p>BALKED, but still determined, he went </p><p>back to town feeling that everyone was </p><p>playing into Briggs’ hands, even the girl. </p><p>He really admired her loyalty to her hus- </p><p>band, yet he knew that she was surely afraid </p><p>of him and could hardly have confidence </p><p>in him. That must she had plainly shown </p><p>after the rescue from the vault. Then why </p><p>was she putting her father’s life into the </p><p>man’s keeping? Surely she must know that </p><p>Briggs would never bring Rothberg back </p><p>alive to incriminate him. </p><p>Puzzled by her actions and the problem </p><p>of rescue, his brain went around and</p><p>around in a perpetual circle of defeat. </p><p>Yet he was by no means ready to give up. </p><p>He tried to get help from the government, </p><p>the state, the county, and finally from </p><p>wealthy citizens. </p><p>The world’s imagination was aroused as </p><p>792 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>It never had been before. Floyd Collins, </p><p>penned beneath tons of rock and sand in a </p><p>Kentucky cave had at one time set its sym- </p><p>pathies afire, but Rothberg confined on an </p><p>inaccessible vessel in plain sight of all, </p><p>stirred sentiment as never before. There </p><p>came flooding to the press little sketches of </p><p>his benefactions and other eulogies from the </p><p>men he had helped. </p><p>For the time, the space ship crowded all </p><p>other items of news to the back pages. </p><p>Scientists gave their opinion as to the possi- </p><p>bility or impossibility of rescue. Thous- </p><p>ands of letters and telegrams poured into </p><p>the city to Briggs, to the Foundation, and to </p><p>Clifford. Money was offered by popular </p><p>subscription and private donation. Some </p><p>of it finally came under Clifford’s control, </p><p>but by that time Briggs was three days </p><p>ahead of him and Clifford knew that with- </p><p>out some miracle he could never beat him. </p><p>Nevertheless he started furiously to work, </p><p>hoping the miracle would happen. He se- </p><p>cured the services of a munition works and </p><p>laid out plans in accordance with the study </p><p>he had given them. He also called to his </p><p>aid every specialist in the field of rocket </p><p>construction. His rocket promised to be </p><p>something exceptionally good. And yet, </p><p>with all its merit, he learned that Briggs was </p><p>better equipped and making an equally </p><p>good or superior rocket and would have it </p><p>completed sometime the nexl day, whereas </p><p>only the skeleton of his own was begun. </p><p>He met Marks downtown that afternoon. </p><p>Marks barely spoke and passed on. Clif- </p><p>ford whistled softly and went his way, but </p><p>it was quite clear he didn’t stand so well at </p><p>the Rothberg place. “Well, he thought, </p><p>“it is just as well that I don’t. I’ve 110 busi- </p><p>ness out there anyway.” </p><p>He caught a bus and rode out to the </p><p>munition factory intending to spend the </p><p>night with his workers. </p><p>“How’s it coming?” he asked the fore- </p><p>man as he entered. </p><p>“Pretty fast, Mr. Peterson. We’re making </p><p>real headway. Every man possible is at </p><p>work and they are putting soul and muscle</p><p>into every minute of it.” </p><p>“Drive them, foreman,” Clifford com- </p><p>manded, “Rothberg is suffering I am sure. </p><p>He may be dying and every second counts.” </p><p>He did not tell the foreman he was run- </p><p>ning a race with Briggs; but walked down </p><p>the rows of screaming lathes and whirling </p><p>wheels. </p><p>“By the way,” he heard above the roar </p><p>and din. </p><p>He turned. The foreman had followed </p><p>him. </p><p>“What is it?” he shouted. </p><p>“Mrs. Briggs called for you on the pri- </p><p>vate phone.” </p><p>“Mrs. Briggs?” Clifford exclaimed. </p><p>“Yes. She seemed pretty much upset </p><p>when I told her you were not here.” </p><p>Clifford stepped to a phone booth out of </p><p>the clamor and called her? She answered </p><p>his ring at once as though she had been </p><p>waiting for him to call. </p><p>“Mr. Peterson,” her voice came in a whis- </p><p>per, “Come out her quickly.” </p><p>“What’s wrong,” he asked, sensing that </p><p>she was quite alarmed. </p><p>“Don’t ask. I can’t tell you,” she replied </p><p>still in a whisper, “I believe someone is lis- </p><p>tening.” </p><p>"Coming right out,” Clifford assured her. </p><p>“Don’t come to the house,” she cautioned, </p><p>“Meet me by the fountain in the sunken </p><p>garden.” </p><p>He hung up the receiver and opened the </p><p>door of the booth, ran down the aisle and </p><p>out the factory door. </p><p>Ten minutes later he crawled from the </p><p>taxi and paid off the driver a block from </p><p>the Rothberg place. Then he waited until </p><p>the cab drove away before he hurried up </p><p>the street and vaulted the low garden wall</p><p>where the shadows of the maples were deep- </p><p>est. Crystal appeared from a clump of </p><p>foliage as he reached the fountain. She </p><p>hardly seemed the same woman he had left </p><p>working with Briggs over the sketches of </p><p>the rocket, that night in the laboratory. </p><p>“BB’s mad,” she whispered, “See—he’s </p><p>here in the garden now, waiting for the </p><p>ship!” </p><p>CLIFFORD glanced through the foliage </p><p>and saw Briggs’ tall figure moving </p><p>restlessly under the dim reflection of a light </p><p>from the street. He paced up and down the </p><p>THE SATELLITE OF DOOM </p><p>793 </p><p>flagstone walk with his face turned toward </p><p>the western horizon. </p><p>“Nothing strange about that,” Clifford </p><p>said depreciatingly. “He’s not the only man </p><p>in the world watching for that ship tonight. </p><p>Maybe I’m mad also,” he tried to laugh re- </p><p>assuringly. </p><p>“Listen,” she insisted and caught his </p><p>hand. </p><p>Briggs’ hoarse voice came rumbling to </p><p>them. He was quoting a verse, but not as </p><p>one soothed by the cadence and rhythm of </p><p>i,t but rather as a man repeating a fearful </p><p>curse: </p><p>“The moving finger writes; and having </p><p>writ </p><p>Moves on, nor all your Piety nor Wit, </p><p>Shall lure it back to cancel half a line, </p><p>Nor all your tears wash out a word of it.” </p><p>The starlike ship rose out of the west. </p><p>Briggs shrank from it as from a blow. He </p><p>turned his back upon it but looked over his </p><p>shoulder as though he could not take his </p><p>eyes away from it. </p><p>“God,” he rumbled on in that hoarse </p><p>deep bass, “God, I’ve got to!” </p><p>The luminous patch grew larger and lar- </p><p>ger against the sky. </p><p>“What do you make of it?” she asked, </p><p>“He’s been going on like that for two nights </p><p>now. I can’t stand it any longer!” </p><p>“Insane,” Clifford announced slowly. </p><p>It was the most charitable thing to say and </p><p>the easiest way out for her when the truth </p><p>became known. </p><p>“I know it,” she whispered, ‘That is why </p><p>I must carry on.” </p><p>Briggs came up the path. She shrank </p><p>into the shadows, but Clifford stood his </p><p>ground. </p><p>She plucked at his sleeve.</p><p>“Hide please, for my sake,” she whisper- </p><p>ed tensely. </p><p>He stood undecided. </p><p>“Hide—please,” she begged, “It won’t do </p><p>for him to see you here with me.” </p><p>Clifford shrugged his shoulders in ac- </p><p>quiesence and disappeared into the leaves. </p><p>Briggs came down the path and she step- </p><p>ped out to meet him. He stopped and </p><p>looked down at her, his shadow outlined </p><p>against a street lamp. The glow of the </p><p>light put a halo into her yellow hair and </p><p>etched the cameolike outline of her profile </p><p>with its radiance. </p><p>For a minute Clifford feared for what </p><p>Briggs might do, for it was plain he was </p><p>all wrought up and unbalanced. He could </p><p>see Crystal’s eyes widening as Briggs stared </p><p>into them and despite her plea he was </p><p>about to step out to let Briggs know she </p><p>was not alone, when Briggs dropped his </p><p>gaze to the fountain and said hoarsely: </p><p>“God, I love you. That was why I—no, </p><p>I’ll forget that now.” </p><p>“What do you mean, BB?” she asked ex- </p><p>citedly. </p><p>He stood beside her as though debating </p><p>something within himself, then he turned </p><p>abruptly and said: “No, I don’t want to </p><p>talk to you about it. I want you to think </p><p>well of me, Crystal." </p><p>He smoked fretfully and seemed unusual- </p><p>ly restless as though something weighty </p><p>was on his mind. After a moment of that </p><p>kind of tense silence he began to pace back </p><p>and forth across the cement flanking of the </p><p>fountain. Then he faced her, turned about </p><p>again and walked away. </p><p>Clifford came from his hiding feeling </p><p>somewhat ashamed. </p><p>“Clifford,” she said impulsively, “I feel </p><p>despicable to say a thing like this about my </p><p>husband, but I have a duty to my father </p><p>also. That is why I called and asked you </p><p>to come here. I don’t believe BB intends to </p><p>make the flight at all. I believe he is</p><p>afraid.” </p><p>“What did you want with me?” he asked </p><p>though he knew very well what was coming. </p><p>“I don’t want him to go. I never did </p><p>from the very first, but I pretended to trust </p><p>him so that he would complete the rocket. </p><p>BB’s gruesome, insanely cruel, sometimes, </p><p>but there is no questioning his ability as an </p><p>inventor. We needed him to perfect the </p><p>rocket, thinking his own life would pay for </p><p>any mistake he made.” </p><p>She laid her hand on his shoulder, “I </p><p>know it’s a good deal like asking your life, </p><p>but will you go up?” </p><p>“Yes,” he answered his heart leaping, </p><p>and added softly, “For him and you.” </p><p>794 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>The Struggle for the Rocket </p><p>SHE took her hand from him and drew </p><p>back as though she was suddenly </p><p>afraid, and said hurriedly: </p><p>“Come at daybreak. I’ll let you in at </p><p>the back gate. You will be off before he </p><p>knows it. I will hinder him in some way.” </p><p>She left him and ran swiftly up the path. </p><p>Clifford remained rigidly where she had </p><p>left him until he saw the light of the porch </p><p>flash upon her white dress as she opened </p><p>the front door and entered the house. The </p><p>door closed quietly behind her. He waited </p><p>wondering just what to do. He was wor- </p><p>ried for what might happen with her alone </p><p>in that house with Briggs, and still he felt </p><p>he ought to get away from the garden and </p><p>come back as she had asked. Undecided he </p><p>waited on, listening for a cry, fearing she </p><p>might be in peril, hoping that Briggs would </p><p>come out so that he could feel easier about </p><p>her. </p><p>A distant motor truck growled as it labor- </p><p>ed up Blackstone hill, a flash of headlights </p><p>swept this way and that as a belated auto </p><p>sped along the drive; the low blast of a tug- </p><p>boat moaned as it moved up harbor; fretful </p><p>broken noises of the city’s sleep. </p><p>Then there was a sleep stir throughout </p><p>the city, blatant honking of autos on the still </p><p>night, greeting again the rising of the earth’s </p><p>newest satellite. </p><p>The city quieted again and Clifford sank </p><p>upon a stone bench. The night was warm, </p><p>the air calm. He had not slept for three </p><p>nights and yet he was not at all drowsy. </p><p>Briggs was on his mind. He knew the man </p><p>had daring and nerve, then how could </p><p>Crystal be right about him being afraid’ </p><p>It was a fearful thing to leave the earth </p><p>which confined all men, and risk the un- </p><p>known of the cosmos. </p><p>He half expected to see Briggs come </p><p>slinking from the house to watch the ship </p><p>again as it mounted the sky; to hear him </p><p>repeat again the lines he had turned into a </p><p>curse; to see him turn his back and look</p><p>over his shoulder as though the ship was a </p><p>magnet his eyes could not shake off. </p><p>And when Briggs did not come, he felt </p><p>even more uneasy about the girl. It was </p><p>certain she was afraid and only a sense of </p><p>loyalty to an unfortunate husband kept her </p><p>within him. Twice Clifford started to the </p><p>house, twice he returned, and finally the </p><p>time came for him to meet her. He cir- </p><p>cled a private hedge and reached the rear </p><p>gate. She wTas there waiting and put a </p><p>finger to her lips as a signal for silence. </p><p>Unexpectedly the gale to the rocket yard </p><p>opened Bnd Briggs stood as glowering as a </p><p>thunder cloud. </p><p>“What are you doing her at this hour?” </p><p>he growled. </p><p>Clifford pushed his bulk through the gate </p><p>into the rocket yard. “I'm going to use </p><p>your rocket, Briggs.” </p><p>“You are going to get out of here or be </p><p>carried out feet first!” Briggs roared. </p><p>Clifford glanced around the yard. The </p><p>rocket angled its long gray nose toward the </p><p>sky, which was just becoming flushed with </p><p>the pink of dawn. It was indeed a beauti- </p><p>ful machine, stream-lined and fully equip- </p><p>ped. There were searchlights, mirrors for </p><p>observation, crawlers to take her about over </p><p>the hull of the satellite, oxygen tanks, and </p><p>every other contrivance imaginable to as- </p><p>sure safety and comfort. Of course, first </p><p>glance did not reveal all that, much of it </p><p>he discovered a few minutes later. But a </p><p>glance did reveal that Briggs had made a </p><p>perfect passenger rocket. </p><p>The door of the rocket chamber was </p><p>ajar, whether Briggs had just left it, or it </p><p>was open accidentally, he did not know. </p><p>The switch which would fire the rocket at </p><p>the next passage of the ship was also open. </p><p>Clifford glanced at his watch. Only </p><p>three minutes to wait! </p><p>He shot a right uppercut into Briggs’ jaw </p><p>and behind that swing he put the hard hit- </p><p>ting vim of his hundred and seventy-five </p><p>pounds. It took Briggs by complete sur- </p><p>prise and sent him grabbing at the gravel.</p><p>Clifford hurdled across the yard and </p><p>closed the contact switch, then climbed into </p><p>the rocket chamber and whirled down the </p><p>levers which closed the door. </p><p>He glanced again at his watch as Briggs </p><p>got to his feet. A full minute before con- </p><p>tact. Briggs shook back his disordered </p><p>hair and looked groggily around. He ap- </p><p>THE SATELLITE OF DOOM </p><p>795 </p><p>parently noticed the closed rocket switch </p><p>and ran for it, but Crystal threw herself </p><p>upon him and circled his waist with her </p><p>arms. </p><p>CLIFFORD knew that contact was at </p><p>hand and tightened down the levers. </p><p>It was a fifty-fifty chance whether Briggs </p><p>would make the switch before the ship pass- </p><p>ed and the rocket was automatically fired. </p><p>Briggs came on dragging the girl, but </p><p>badly hampered. Briggs turned on her and </p><p>struck her in the face. Time was up. Clif- </p><p>ford’s blood boiled but he couldn’t leave </p><p>then, not even to help the girl. Contact </p><p>was at hand. He got one more glimpse of </p><p>Briggs. A short, bull nose pistol was in his </p><p>hand and though Clifford heard no report </p><p>inside that tight tube, he did see a whiff of </p><p>thin blue smoke and noticed the revolver </p><p>was not aimed at him nor the girl, but at </p><p>the chronometer which closed the contact, </p><p>and that was all he saw for he was catapul- </p><p>ted upward toward the sky. </p><p>“Too late, you fool,” Clifford thought as </p><p>he felt the rocket rising with increasing </p><p>speed, vaulting him up, up, up, out of the </p><p>garden, out of the world, leaving the earth </p><p>shrinking like a dwindling landscape far, far </p><p>below. </p><p>Launched into strange and unknown dan- </p><p>gers, he had no thought of them, but was </p><p>wondering about the two he had left so far </p><p>below in the rocket yard. </p><p>Five minutes passed. He wailed anx- </p><p>iously for the banging contact with the steel </p><p>hull of the satellite. Ten minutes passed </p><p>and nothing at all, not the slightest noise. </p><p>Impossible! What had happened? Had </p><p>he actually touched the vessel and there </p><p>been no noise due to vacuum of space? </p><p>He knew there could be no noise outside </p><p>the tube for there was no air to carry sound, </p><p>but inside the air should have carried it to </p><p>him. </p><p>Another minute went by. He looked out </p><p>the port hole again and again. He could </p><p>sec nothing. Had Briggs overheard bis </p><p>talk with the girl and changed the chrono-</p><p>meter to send him out before the ship pass- </p><p>ed? Was he lost in the infinite stretches </p><p>of space? </p><p>The observing mirrors were folded back </p><p>into the niches of the rocket hull to protect </p><p>them from the burning air on the trip up. </p><p>He knew that he was then far above the fric- </p><p>tion of air and he decided to use them to </p><p>try get a glimpse of the earth. He worked </p><p>them out and found there was no friction </p><p>against them at all. He did not even seem </p><p>to be moving. He felt as though he were </p><p>suspended in space without motion or di- </p><p>rection. He felt as fixed as though he were </p><p>anchored to the solid earth, and yet he knew </p><p>he could have hardly lost the furious velo- </p><p>city he had gained. </p><p>His mirrors caught the earth, far below. </p><p>He must have already have travelled </p><p>around it for a long ways, for the land- </p><p>scape seemed whirling backward dizzily as </p><p>though he looked down from the window of </p><p>a speeding plane. Twirling his mirrors </p><p>about for new angles, he realized that he </p><p>was caught in an orbit all his own and was </p><p>one of the two earth beings out in space </p><p>beyond human help. The great gulf of </p><p>space spread about him and the tawny </p><p>world below seemed exotic and bare, swept </p><p>now and then by a curtain of cloud bank </p><p>and again caught in the shining splendor of </p><p>the blazing sun. </p><p>With a feeling of resignation he turned </p><p>his mirrors hopelessly. He caught some- </p><p>thing else in the glass! The space ship! </p><p>Briggs could not have changed the chrono- </p><p>meter after all! Why the sixteenth of a sec- </p><p>ond would account for that quarter of a </p><p>mile miss. Il must have been that shot </p><p>Briggs gave the chronometer which had done </p><p>the trick. The bullet must have closed the </p><p>contact just the fraction before the ship was </p><p>due, for he was ahead of the ship! </p><p>He gazed pop-eyed at the long gray </p><p>thing, seemingly at rest with its head point- </p><p>ed toward him. It was only a quarter of a </p><p>mile away, and yet it might as well have </p><p>been a thousand miles. </p><p>He wondered if he could devise some </p><p>way to slow up so that the ship might over- </p><p>take him, but he knew that in space noth- </p><p>ing would offer die least brake to his speed. </p><p>The mirror caught the blazing sun against</p><p>a black sky totally devoid of stars. A mys- </p><p>tic, unreal sun, a weird uncanny sky, and </p><p>796 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>he wa9 alone with only a thermos bottle of </p><p>coffee! </p><p>CHAPTER VII </p><p>Still Alive! </p><p>WHAT could he do? Absolutely noth- </p><p>ing. His problem as great as lhat </p><p>of rescuing Rothberg. He thought of re- </p><p>leasing part of the gases in the head of the </p><p>rocket and taking ihe risk of them pro- </p><p>jecting him back lo earth, but that would be </p><p>too cowardly. How could he face Crystal </p><p>after his failure? </p><p>Then he found a new puzzle. Why was </p><p>the sun in the glass? Was he falling? </p><p>Something certainly had happened to alter </p><p>his course. </p><p>He looked for the satellite, but it was </p><p>nowhere to be seen. That was queer! He </p><p>had not changed the levers which moved the </p><p>mirrors. He worked the mirror about and </p><p>again caught a view of the ship. He drew </p><p>his free hand across his forehead. Was he </p><p>going daft? Was there some fluid in those </p><p>upper regions to which steel was permeable </p><p>and which had affected his brain so that </p><p>he was seeing things? The magnets in the </p><p>nose of the rocket were full on, and yet the </p><p>heavy steel base was pointing toward the </p><p>satellite. Not only that but the ship was </p><p>between him and the earth! No—it was </p><p>coming up, moving around him in a circle, </p><p>and the butt of the rocket followed it like </p><p>a compass needle! </p><p>The ship rose and eclipsed the sun. </p><p>Then it occurred to him lhat the truth was </p><p>the satellite was still and the rocket was </p><p>circling it, for he remembered lhat there </p><p>would be an attraction between two bodies </p><p>moving freely in space, and that the smaller </p><p>body would form a satellite of the larger. </p><p>And yet% those strong magnets in the head </p><p>of the rocket did not seem lo take hold of </p><p>the ship at the distance of a quarter of a </p><p>mile, although they were the most powerful </p><p>magnets that had ever been made. </p><p>Around and around the ship he went like </p><p>the little rubber ball he had swung around </p><p>his head that night at the board meeting— </p><p>like one of the carriage of an invisible fer-</p><p>ns wheel with its hub at the ship. He felt </p><p>as though he were floating in oceans of air. </p><p>What little gravity he felt was directed tow- </p><p>ard the steel mass at the base of his tube </p><p>and not toward the earth at all! </p><p>But he had little time to wonder at the </p><p>new laws which had control of him. He </p><p>was in the most desperate situation imagin- </p><p>able; one that was entirely foreign to hu- </p><p>man experience and he would have to do </p><p>some bold, pioneer thinking if he were </p><p>to extricate himself. </p><p>Gazing out the window of his little room </p><p>he decided to take a long chance, really the </p><p>only one possible. He pulled the switch </p><p>which discharged the gases in the head of </p><p>his rocket. The butt of the rocket pointed </p><p>directly toward the ship, and Clifford knew </p><p>a little gas might do no good at all, and too </p><p>might send him ricocheting far beyond the </p><p>pull of the ship and make his position even </p><p>worse—if such a thing were possible. In </p><p>truth though he did not expect anything </p><p>to happen at all. </p><p>He released a fraction of the gas in the </p><p>nose of the rocket. To his surprise he went </p><p>winging aross the quarter of a mile and he </p><p>cut his gas immediately. Before he hard- </p><p>ly knew what happened, his rocket swapped </p><p>ends, the magnets caught the pull o* the </p><p>steel ship and with a resounding jar he </p><p>made contact head on as neatly as he could </p><p>have wished. </p><p>Even in his joy at having retrieved him- </p><p>self from a hopeless situation he thought </p><p>with a great deal of interest of the mechan- </p><p>ism of the rocket that permitted it to move </p><p>through the vacuity of space. Surely there </p><p>was no atmosphere where he was, for the </p><p>friction of il would have started him in a </p><p>spiral descent toward the earth. Then what </p><p>law caused the change ok velocity and en- </p><p>abled him to make contact? </p><p>He pondered over the thing as he moved </p><p>his crawlers this way and that, ■ working </p><p>back and forth over the huge hull, in hie </p><p>search for the porthole. </p><p>DEEPLY engrossed with this problem, </p><p>for the scientific trend of his nature </p><p>was always alert, one of his mirrors discov- </p><p>ered the porthole and he worked his rocket</p><p>over near it. </p><p>THE SATELLITE OF DOOM </p><p>797 </p><p>The glass was opaque with frost which </p><p>had gathered inside the ship. He extended </p><p>one of the mirrors so that it tapped on the </p><p>glass. He waited and tapped again. </p><p>Was Rothberg dead? Was he all alone </p><p>beyond the barriers which divided life to </p><p>earth ? </p><p>Sad and discouraged he waited and lap- </p><p>ped again. Then he gasped with joy. </p><p>Something was rubbing away at the frost </p><p>on the glass! Rothberg must be alive! </p><p>He watched breathlessly as a place was </p><p>cleaned and the drawn face of the old man </p><p>pressed against the glass. There seemed to </p><p>be a hopeless bravery in the haggard fea- </p><p>tures as the gray old eyes searched about </p><p>lo seek the cause of that noise out in the </p><p>cosmos. Rothberg’s eyes opened with a </p><p>start. Hope leaped into them. Every fea- </p><p>ture portrayed the fight for control he made </p><p>as he took in the rocket and then Clifford </p><p>himself. </p><p>Before Clifford could send any kind of a </p><p>signal Rothberg left the porthole and soon </p><p>he returned with an empty pitcher which he </p><p>turned upside down and motioned to his </p><p>throat indicating it was choked and dry. </p><p>Clifford noticed that he was gasping. The </p><p>ship was big and had contained a good many </p><p>cubic feet of air, but it was plain that Roth- </p><p>berg now had little of it left to breathe. </p><p>Briggs most certainly had lied about his in- </p><p>vention to rinse carbon from respired air. </p><p>Rothberg must have help soon or there </p><p>would be no need of it at all. </p><p>Even as Rothberg stared at him hope </p><p>seesmed to fade from ihe kindly old face. </p><p>He was no mean scientist and certainly </p><p>knew what insurmountable difficulties to </p><p>his rescue. Clifford motioned that he must </p><p>return better equipped before he could hope </p><p>to do anything. </p><p>The old eyes smiled encouragement but </p><p>the chin sagged a little and then drew up </p><p>tight and firm. Plainly Rothberg believed </p><p>he would never come out alive.. Yet, what </p><p>could Clifford do to encourage him? The </p><p>immutable laws which confined life to ihe </p><p>earth were all against him. Try as he</p><p>would he could think of no plan to enter </p><p>the ship without exposing both of them to </p><p>certain death. </p><p>He glanced at his chronometer. The loss </p><p>in not making direct contact had eaten heav- </p><p>ily into his time and he was nearly back </p><p>around the earth again. Time to kick off </p><p>was at hand. He indicated with motions </p><p>that he would soon be back, and Rothberg </p><p>took his finger and wrole on a portion of </p><p>the frosted glass: </p><p>“Tell Crystal BB-” </p><p>The sentence was but started. Whatever </p><p>he wrote or intended to write, Clifford </p><p>could not know, for contact came and the </p><p>gases discharged. He was shot away. In a </p><p>few seconds he found himself floating down- </p><p>ward as the blades of his helicopter caught </p><p>the rare upper air and began to race fur- </p><p>iously above the tube. </p><p>He had been but a few seconds going up. </p><p>It took him an hour to come down. Teles- </p><p>copes on the earth’s surface must have pick- </p><p>ed up his descent, for there were ten thous- </p><p>and people gathered around the farmstead </p><p>near the outskirts of town, when he landed. </p><p>He opened the door and staggered out of the </p><p>rocket. Then thousand voices and auto </p><p>horns drove him deaf with their raucous </p><p>noise. </p><p>The Solution At Last! </p><p>HE paid no attention to the insistent re- </p><p>porters who trailed him. All he want- </p><p>ed was a phone to find out what had hap- </p><p>pened in the rocket yard after he had left. </p><p>Among all that sea of faces about him was </p><p>none he felt he could ask such a personal </p><p>question. He hailed a car and the man in- </p><p>side seempd glad to be of service. Clif- </p><p>ford asked to be driven at once to the muni- </p><p>tion works which was only a mile away. </p><p>They went into seventy by the time they </p><p>were on the highway. </p><p>At the works he got hold of Crystal and </p><p>was much relieved when she answered the </p><p>phone. </p><p>“Mrs. Briggs,” he said and found it hard </p><p>to get used to the fact that she was BB’s </p><p>wife, “I have good news for you.” </p><p>“Tell me,” she begged, “Is he alive?” </p><p>“Yes, he is alive, but his condition is des- </p><p>perate. Your—I mean there were no pro- </p><p>visions made for oxygen or water. I don’t </p><p>know about food.” </p><p>798 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>“Could you speak with him at all’” </p><p>“No, but I saw him plainly at the port </p><p>hole. He seemed brave but rather discour- </p><p>aged. I don’t think he has much hope.” </p><p>“Have you,” she begged, “Did you find </p><p>anything to give hope?” </p><p>“Not up there,” he replied and wondered </p><p>whether he should tell her the truth, “There </p><p>is no way I can think of to transfer him to a </p><p>rocket while the ship is aloft. We must </p><p>bring her down.” </p><p>“But you said it couldn’t be brought </p><p>down! That it was like death! You told </p><p>BB that and it’s true!” </p><p>“Listen a minute,” he insisted, “I forgot </p><p>one thing when I told Briggs that.” </p><p>“What?” she cried eagerly. </p><p>“That the ship wa9 of steel. We’ll have </p><p>to build magnets.” </p><p>“Magnets?” </p><p>“Yes, powerful enough to hinder the ship </p><p>at every revolution so that its speed may be </p><p>checked enough to bring it under the influ- </p><p>ence of the earth’s gravity.” </p><p>“But that would crush him!” </p><p>“No, get hold of Blair and the rest of the </p><p>Board. It will take close calculations, but </p><p>the ship can be brought down in a spiral </p><p>which will increase as it meets the friction </p><p>of heavier and heavier layers of air. Blair </p><p>can calculate where to place our magnets </p><p>so as to let her drop in the sea outside the </p><p>harbor. She is hollow and will rise and we </p><p>can get him out.” </p><p>“Oh God!” she said earnestly, “I hope </p><p>you are right.” </p><p>He hung up and went back to the plant. </p><p>In an hour Gertz, Played, Ralls, and </p><p>Blair were there and a few minutes later </p><p>Crystal and Briggs came into the dingy room </p><p>used as an office. </p><p>Briggs regarded Clifford with the eyes of </p><p>a wary cat. There was a hint of suppressed </p><p>ferocity in his manner, and an excited cur-</p><p>iosity in his gaze, but he did not ask how </p><p>Clifford had fared aloft nor what he had </p><p>learned. In fact he tried to act as though </p><p>nothing had happened that morning in the </p><p>rocket yard. Clifford after a look of ap- </p><p>praisal gave him no more attention and went </p><p>over to the group of scientists who had al- </p><p>ready gathered. Crystal followed him and </p><p>Briggs remained near the door. </p><p>He explained in a few words how he had </p><p>started work on the largest electro-magnets </p><p>ever constructed and how he hoped to ham- </p><p>per the speed of the satellite until it would </p><p>respond to the earth’s gravitational influ- </p><p>ence. He asked Blair to calculate where </p><p>the magnets would have to be mounted to </p><p>bring down the ship just off shore in the </p><p>Atlantic, and asked Gertz to calculate the </p><p>power necessary to influence the ship. </p><p>Gertz listened until Clifford had finished </p><p>and then he shook his warty little head. </p><p>Ralls echoed that shake by a baffled ex- </p><p>pression on his lean features. </p><p>“Your theory will not work out,” Gertz </p><p>whispered to him so that the girl could not </p><p>hear. </p><p>“Why?” Clifford asked alarmed. </p><p>GERTZ lowered one eyelid as though try- </p><p>ing to penetrate a deep distance, “I be- </p><p>lieve you had a fair example of how short a </p><p>distance the magnetic field will affect in the </p><p>way your magnets acted in the rocket as you </p><p>circled the ship. Two hundred miles is en- </p><p>tirely too far for the last hope that the use </p><p>of electro-magnets will bring do'wn the </p><p>ship.” </p><p>Clifford dared not look at Crystal. He </p><p>knew the expression on his face would be- </p><p>tray him. But he did not look at Briggs </p><p>who had pushed into the group to catch </p><p>what Gertz was saying. Briggs’ face was an </p><p>impersonal mask. If he felt any emotion </p><p>he did not show it by the slightest change </p><p>of expression. </p><p>“Has anything gone wrong?” Crystal ask- </p><p>ed as silence seemed to smother the little </p><p>group. </p><p>Clifford ran his fingers through his short </p><p>cropped hair and made no reply.</p><p>To cover their gloom the scientists dis- </p><p>cussed electro-magnetism with an air of ab- </p><p>straction which revealed that their minds </p><p>were on something else. </p><p>“What has gone wrong?” Crystal asked </p><p>again. </p><p>“Nothing! Nothing at all!” Clifford </p><p>shouted nervously above the low buzz of </p><p>voices. </p><p>THE SATELLITE OF DOOM </p><p>799 </p><p>Every man in the room turned upon him </p><p>as though they thought his worry had sud- </p><p>denly turned him daft. </p><p>“I’ve got it!” he shouted again and </p><p>waived a doubled fist. “Listen you men. </p><p>Find some flaw in this if you can! Rock- </p><p>ets are the solution after all! We have </p><p>dozens of them ready at the laboratory. Fill </p><p>them with bar magnets to increase their </p><p>weight and hold on the ship. Fire enough </p><p>of them to hamper her and bring her down </p><p>in a spiral until she hits the sea!” </p><p>“You’ve got it!” Gertz beamed, pounding </p><p>his fist on his knee. “Fire them with no </p><p>more velocity than just to make contact? </p><p>They will drag her down. The problem of </p><p>how many is for Professor Blair!” </p><p>Clifford’s eyes were glowing as he looked </p><p>at the girl and then for Briggs, but Briggs </p><p>had disappeared. Not that anyone cared. </p><p>BB had been useful in completing the rock- </p><p>ets, but now nothing more complicated than </p><p>bar magnets were needed to do the work. </p><p>Daybreak came again and Clifford stood </p><p>beside the girl as the rockets shrieked up- </p><p>ward to meet the ship. They watch </p><p>through telescopes which had been mounted </p><p>in the yard. </p><p>Clifford turned to the foremen and de- </p><p>manded : </p><p>“There are eleven of them. Blair said </p><p>there should only be ten! Great God you </p><p>will drown him sure!” </p><p>“We fired only ten,” the foreman declared </p><p>stubbornly. “Didn’t I count them myself. </p><p>Every man working counted them. There </p><p>were only ten.”	*</p><p>Clifford drew his lips thin and wondered </p><p>if he had miscounted. The ship was then </p><p>past the vision of his telescope and too far </p><p>away to recount. But one thing was cer- </p><p>tain, she was coming down swiftly. The </p><p>halt in her flight and the curvature of her </p><p>orbit were apparent even though Blair had </p><p>figured it would take three revolutions to </p><p>bring it down and it would fall faster when </p><p>it encountered denser air.</p><p>Though six hours remained before they </p><p>expected the ship to fall, there was an im- </p><p>mediate surge for the shore line. Thous- </p><p>ands of autos crammed each other and </p><p>honked for room. They crowded each oth- </p><p>er and edged for positions as close as pos- </p><p>sible to the point Professor Blair had picked </p><p>for the landing. </p><p>That extra rocket troubled Clifford no </p><p>little, though he said no more about it. He </p><p>got Crystal and a number of close friends </p><p>aboard a small cutter and pushed off to </p><p>avoid the mob ashore. Briggs could not be </p><p>found. Crystal seemed worried but the in- </p><p>tense suspense as to the fate of her father </p><p>must have kept her mind off him to some ex- </p><p>tent, for she did not mention him in all the </p><p>six hours she wailed—watching the passing </p><p>of the steel satellite in its narrowing orbit. </p><p>Noon came. The summer sun blazed </p><p>down upon the swelling waves as </p><p>they came sweeping in from the limitless </p><p>sea. Thousands upon thousands of people </p><p>who jammed the shore had been waiting </p><p>since early morning. </p><p>CHAPTER VIII </p><p>A Rescue and a Tragedy </p><p>THEY milled about raising a ceaseless </p><p>dust which settled slowly in the calm </p><p>suffocating heal, and still they held tena- </p><p>ciously to their places near the shore. </p><p>Little boats and large ones ploughed here </p><p>and there seeking a point of vantage back </p><p>of the long watery lane governed by govern- </p><p>ment cutters. </p><p>Someone shouted: “There it comes!” </p><p>The shout was taken up and tossed from </p><p>man to man. Heads craned and all eyes </p><p>strained toward the east. The wave of hu- </p><p>manity on shore surged forward. There </p><p>were cries, the shouting of officers and </p><p>shouting of the eager, curious mass they </p><p>sought to hold in check. Ten thousand </p><p>hands shaded ten thousand upturned eyes </p><p>from the glare of the high noonday sun. </p><p>A huge monoplane swept in from the </p><p>sea bringing passengers from down coast</p><p>to witness the most marvelous landing in </p><p>the history of men. And when the mob </p><p>saw the new comer was no more than a huge </p><p>plane, it wailed in disappointment; but did </p><p>not retreat in the slightest. </p><p>Minutes passed. The sultry heat seemed </p><p>almost unbearable. The rails of the cutter </p><p>800 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>were like furnace rods fresh from ihe fire. </p><p>Clifford shielded Crystal with her lavender </p><p>parasol, taking the sun himself. </p><p>And then from out the horizon sped a </p><p>long gray shape, silent as an oncoming </p><p>hawk. It was not riding high as had been </p><p>expected, but hugging the sea. Even as </p><p>they watched it spanked the water and sent </p><p>a long silver veil of spray sparkling into </p><p>the sun. </p><p>Crystal caught her hands together and </p><p>stood petrified unable lo bring her glasses </p><p>to her eyes for a better view. Clifford felt </p><p>a thrill not wholly accounted for by the </p><p>success of the rescue. Something historic </p><p>was taking place, something which held a </p><p>marvelous prophecy—that some day this </p><p>miracle should become an hourly occur- </p><p>rence and earth folks would ride in from </p><p>the cosmos to land with exactness at every </p><p>port of the world. </p><p>The ship came speeding on, skipping up- </p><p>on the water, like a flat rock tossed across </p><p>the surface of a pond. She dove and </p><p>Stortz groaned and leaned far over the rail. </p><p>She rose, her wet steel glistening in the </p><p>sunlight and still Crystal made not the </p><p>slightest move. </p><p>A mile away Clifford saw that something </p><p>was riding her back. He brought his for- </p><p>gotten glasses to his eyes. It was a rocket! </p><p>One that seemed strangely familiar even at </p><p>that distance. It looked like the one that </p><p>Briggs had made for the rescue flight. </p><p>There were eleven after all! Briggs must </p><p>have fired the other one in hopes of sinking </p><p>the ship. </p><p>“Good God!” Clifford breathed and the </p><p>girl turned about and found her voice at </p><p>last. </p><p>“Is he dead?” she screamed, “Is he dead?” </p><p>Clifford shook his head, but his heart </p><p>sank for he felt lhat it would be only a </p><p>question of minutes now. That eleventh </p><p>rocket was dragging down the ship. It </p><p>was diving again! Plowing deep and then </p><p>wallowing back to the surface like a wound- </p><p>ed sea beast.</p><p>Clifford turned to the captain of the cut- </p><p>ter. “Have you a rifle on board?” </p><p>“Why, yes,” the captain answered plain- </p><p>ly puzzled. </p><p>“Have one brought to me at once, sits </p><p>It may save the satellite.” </p><p>The Captain barked an order. Clifford </p><p>looked again at the satellite wallowing </p><p>along, half under water. </p><p>“Get to as quick as you can, Captain,” </p><p>he begged. </p><p>The Captain shouted an order and the </p><p>cutter got under way. </p><p>The satellite was still moving swiftly, but </p><p>losing its speed like a passenger train draw- </p><p>ing into a station. Someone handed Clif- </p><p>ford a rifle. He took it and did not look </p><p>around, his eyes still upon the satellite. </p><p>“Wlial are you going to do?” Crystal </p><p>cried. </p><p>“Briggs’ bullet set off the rocket in the </p><p>yard. 1 am hoping mine will shake her </p><p>loose from the ship.” </p><p>With a scream of discharging gases, the </p><p>rocket soared away with such rapidity the </p><p>eye could hardly follow its long gray shape </p><p>into the air. But Clifford was not trying </p><p>to watch its meteorlike flight. He was look- </p><p>ing at the satellite. The shock had sent her </p><p>under again, but before she was swallowed </p><p>by the sea something long and rigid toppled </p><p>from the soaring rocket and struck the glist- </p><p>ening hull. A man had fallen stiffly from </p><p>the rocket and as he struck the hull he </p><p>shattered into a thousand flying ruby crys- </p><p>tals which sparkled in the sun. Frozen in </p><p>the absolute cold of space he had shattered </p><p>like rotten glass. Clifford thought of the </p><p>little rubber ball he had dropped into the </p><p>container of liquid air. </p><p>“It’s BB!” the girl screamed and covered </p><p>her eyes with her hands. </p><p>Clifford caught her and looked down at </p><p>the undulating surface of the glittering sea. </p><p>The satellite was nowhere to be seen. </p><p>For a moment not a sound came from sea </p><p>or deck, except the lapping of waves and </p><p>the throb of engines. Clifford still held </p><p>Crystal and felt her shaken with despair. </p><p>He did not know how to comfort her. All </p><p>that he could do was to stand stiffly and </p><p>think. </p><p>Suddenly he heard another bark of or- </p><p>ders. A running of hurried feet across </p><p>deck. The confused shouting and reshout- </p><p>ing of orders. </p><p>THE SATELLITE OF DOOM </p><p>801 </p><p>Boats were being lowered! Wby? </p><p>He looked again down at the sea and saw </p><p>a feeble churning of the water near the </p><p>place where the satellite had gone down. </p><p>A head came above the wavs and then sank </p><p>from sight. </p><p>Rothberg! lie must have broken the </p><p>porthole glass and come up as the ship </p><p>sank. </p><p>A week later Rothberg was about again. </p><p>He beamed at Clifford as he came into the </p><p>room. Crystal was standing beside his </p><p>chair watching Clifford with a new admira- </p><p>tion in her eyes. </p><p>“There is one thing that puzzles me,” </p><p>Clifford said, “And that is what killed </p><p>Briggs? What was he doing up there any- </p><p>way?” </p><p>Rothberg’s mouth drew firm and Crystal </p><p>looked at the pattern of a rich rug which </p><p>was spread across the floor. </p><p>“The answer is very simple,” Rothberg </p><p>answered after a pause. “I saw him make </p><p>contact and watched him through the port- </p><p>hole. He opened the door of the rocket and </p><p>it seemed his chest literally blew open like </p><p>a rotten tire under too much pressure. He </p><p>had a sledge hammer in his hand and 1 took </p><p>it he planned to break the porthole glass. </p><p>No doubt he would have succeeded but he </p><p>overlooked the fact that the pressure of air </p><p>inside his lungs was fifteen pounds to the </p><p>square inch. He had on some kind of a </p><p>jacket to protect him from the cold, but the </p><p>explosion blew it wide open.” </p><p>Rothberg shook bis shoulders as though </p><p>ridding himself of what had occurred up </p><p>there, then he said confidently: </p><p>“We're going it for satellites right this </p><p>time, my boy. Fit them for passengers as </p><p>well as mail. It's a big thing that we have </p><p>circlcd the earth in two hours, but eventual- </p><p>ly we may run an air line between here and </p><p>Venus. You know' the main problem of in- </p><p>terplanetary flight has been that of landing </p><p>the ship, and now we have solved that!5'</p><p>He put his large veined hands upon the </p><p>girl. “Crystal, little soldier, get out and </p><p>let us get to work.” </p><p>She turned and left them reluctantly. </p><p>Clifford watched her until she reached the </p><p>door. She turned and though neither said </p><p>a word, a glance between them held a pro- </p><p>mise that all would turn out right. </p><p>THE END </p><p>What Is Your Knowledge Of Science? </p><p>Test Yourself B*j This Questionnaire </p><p>1.

It turned </p><p>out to be one of the most astounding things </p><p>Lhat even this modern world of 1975 had </p><p>been privileged to see. </p><p>The people were filled with both awe and </p><p>terror long before I knew of the existence </p><p>of the so-called “Hot Spot”, the chemical </p><p>phenomenon that appeared over the North </p><p>Pacific and startled airmen and operators </p><p>of aircraft throughout the world. </p><p>Having gleaned from news bulletins noth- </p><p>ing more than the fact of its existence—after </p><p>discrediting the usual traditional newspaper </p><p>tales—I was determined, as an aeronautical </p><p>engineer, to learn more about it. </p><p>I was seated in the lounging room of the </p><p>Cosmopolitan Club at the Grand Central </p><p>Air Terminal in Los Angeles when Joe </p><p>Blaine set down from a freight hop to Vlad- </p><p>ivostok. The minute I saw his great sesqui- </p><p>amphibian trundle up to the loading dock </p><p>I knew she had weathered an unusual storm. </p><p>Her great wings were all but limp, and one </p><p>of the tips of the upper surface had been </p><p>torn away as neatly as if it had been cut </p><p>with a huge pair of scissors. Her motors </p><p>died quickly, as if the mechanics were in </p><p>great haste to stop their vacuum-cleaner-Iike </p><p>802 </p><p>Illustrated by Marchioni </p><p>whirr. She sat there in silence for but a </p><p>moment, and then the door of the control </p><p>room opened and Joe Blaine’s first mechanic </p><p>came down, followed by his assistant. </p><p>They were greeted by an anxious dis- </p><p>patcher who waited there at the ladder un- </p><p>til Captain Blaine emerged from the control </p><p>room, and 1 joined them there, wondering </p><p>what could have taken place. Blaine, stolid, </p><p>immaculate and young, came down to gaze </p><p>steadily at that torn wing for a moment </p><p>before turning to us and heaving a long </p><p>drawn out sigh. </p><p>“Such heat I have never seen,” he said to </p><p>the dispatcher, after having nodded to us </p><p>a hurried greeting. “The telephones went </p><p>803 </p><p>out ihe minute I got your orders to swing </p><p>north, and that was all that saved me. That </p><p>was six hours ago. Had I waited to change </p><p>my course I would have flown directly into </p><p>ihe path of the thing. It was a phenomenon </p><p>beyond my comprehension—a ray of light </p><p>that boiled the ocean below us; and when </p><p>I turned and flew away from it the plane </p><p>was lifted several thousand feet in the heavy </p><p>updraft that came from that furnace-like </p><p>spot on the surface of the sea. We did not </p><p>find clearance for five miles north of there. </p><p>Look at the plane—you know the rest!” </p><p>G ASTRO, the dispatcher, as well as the </p><p>rest of us, were astounded. We search' </p><p>804 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>ed each other’s faces for an answer to this </p><p>strange mystery, but no manner of specula- </p><p>tion would solve it. We went into the office </p><p>where Captain Blaine sat down to write out </p><p>his report, all the lime being interrupted </p><p>by Gastro. </p><p>“But there wasn’t any report on it from </p><p>the weather bureau,” objected the dis- </p><p>patcher. “If it is a sunspot—” </p><p>“Sunspot! Ridicu- </p><p>lous!” Captain Blaine </p><p>looked up from his re- </p><p>ports. “Do you think </p><p>a sunspot would affect </p><p>an area of only five </p><p>miles square? Do you </p><p>think a sunspot would </p><p>melt off the end of one </p><p>wing of my plane—a </p><p>few feet at the tip — </p><p>and boil the water of </p><p>the sea? I feel for- </p><p>tunate, Gastro, to have </p><p>flown out of it in the </p><p>face of such terrific </p><p>heat. Look at the sides </p><p>of my plane. The </p><p>varnish is melted </p><p>away. Why, even the </p><p>wing covering is shriv- </p><p>eled!” </p><p>While I waited anx- </p><p>iously for the captain </p><p>to finish his reports, </p><p>Gastro stepped from </p><p>the room into the of- </p><p>fices of the weather </p><p>bureau. He returned, </p><p>presently, to shake his </p><p>head doubtfully and </p><p>pace the floor. </p><p>“Hang it all, Blaine, </p><p>can't you tell me some- </p><p>thing more about this </p><p>hot spot? Wasn’t </p><p>there anything above or below it that might </p><p>have caused the trouble? Can’t you give </p><p>me a faint idea of what caused it? The </p><p>officials of tlie company are too much </p><p>disturbed about this for a mere report.”</p><p>“I’d be glad to tell the board of directors </p><p>what I have told you. If in my haste I </p><p>have neglected to mention something, I am </p><p>sorry; but it is just as I told you: I was </p><p>flying three hundred miles per hour at ten </p><p>thousand feet when I saw a shimmer on the </p><p>ocean and felt a draught of hot air through </p><p>the ventilator. As the heat increased I </p><p>called you to report it, and before we could </p><p>finish our conversation the radiophone went </p><p>out. I swung lo the north, and barely es- </p><p>caped complete de- </p><p>struction.” </p><p>“How do you know </p><p>it was five miles across </p><p>it?” </p><p>“I only approximat- </p><p>ed it by the distance </p><p>I flew to get around it. </p><p>It may have traveled </p><p>north as I did.” </p><p>* # * </p><p>That was all I </p><p>learned of the “Uncon- </p><p>trollable Destroyer” </p><p>lhat day. The radio </p><p>bulletin carried tire </p><p>news to the world, and </p><p>astronomers and me- </p><p>teorologists through- </p><p>out the globe specu- </p><p>lated upon the possi- </p><p>bilities of this strange </p><p>phenomenon. </p><p>Passenger traffic had </p><p>long ago ceased to </p><p>travel the great circle </p><p>route to Siberia. But </p><p>the freight planes had </p><p>found belter flying </p><p>conditions up there. </p><p>Dozens of great planes </p><p>flew through this area </p><p>weekly. Not one of </p><p>those that came in a </p><p>few hours either before </p><p>or after Captain Blaine </p><p>had seen any indication of what had been </p><p>reported by this young airman and his </p><p>crew. But it was assumed at the meeting </p><p>of the board of directors, where Captain</p><p>Blaine told his story, that hardly any two </p><p>planes lhat flew out to Vladivostok over </p><p>this route would strike exactly the same </p><p>y /~\NE of the greatest sour- </p><p>ces of misfortune to the </p><p>race is the fact that so </p><p>many million square miles </p><p>of the earth’s surface must </p><p>remain desolate arctic </p><p>wastes, while the habitable </p><p>portions of the globe are </p><p>over-crowded. Many sci- </p><p>entists have spent a good </p><p>deal of time and energy in </p><p>the attempt to find a means </p><p>to transform what is now </p><p>barren into a place fit for </p><p>human ssse. One such </p><p>scheme for example would </p><p>divert the Gulf Stream </p><p>from its course across the </p><p>Atlantic in order that it </p><p>shall warm our north At- </p><p>lantic seaboard. There is </p><p>no doubt that any scheme </p><p>that could make Alaska, </p><p>the arctics, northern Can- </p><p>ada, Greenland, etc., places </p><p>of moderate climate, would </p><p>be of the greatest benefit </p><p>to the human race. But </p><p>such a gigantic plan could </p><p>not succeed before many </p><p>disheartening and often </p><p>tragic experiments were </p><p>made. We can thus sympa- </p><p>thize with our poor profes- </p><p>sor in this original and ex- </p><p>citing story, for we know </p><p>that his motives were of </p><p>^ the best. </p><p>TIIE FLAMING CLOUD </p><p>805 </p><p>latitude. This was a point in Captain </p><p>Blaine’s favor, for he was known among </p><p>his fellow flyers and the directors of sev- </p><p>eral air lines as having always cut down </p><p>the regular schedule by hours, wherever he </p><p>flew. </p><p>rpHE investigation consumed but half an </p><p>&gt; I hour, but two more hours were spent </p><p>in speculation. As (he aeronautical expert </p><p>of the company, L was of course invited to </p><p>attend. It was when President Fred Brett- </p><p>ner, the young and adventurous airman who </p><p>had become an official of the company, </p><p>arose to speak in ihe midst of rampant dis- </p><p>cussion that all eyes were turned to him. </p><p>As always, in the face of </p><p>sudden and unexplained </p><p>danger, men’s fears were </p><p>overcoming their judg- </p><p>ment and it was evident </p><p>that effective leadership </p><p>and determined action </p><p>was necessary. Unless </p><p>that action came, the </p><p>meeting would degener- </p><p>ate into the heated squab- </p><p>bles of panic-stricken and </p><p>fear dazed men. Brett- </p><p>ner spoke quietly. </p><p>“Joe Blaine and I are </p><p>going to retrace his course </p><p>in a fast plane this after- </p><p>noon,” he announced. </p><p>“We won’t have it!” </p><p>said the chairman. “We </p><p>cannot afford to take chances on losing you. </p><p>Let me suggest that you send an engineer, a </p><p>man who is familiar with geology, astron- </p><p>omy and meteorology. I think Thomason </p><p>will be the man.” </p><p>My heart leaped to my throat. Blaine </p><p>turned to me and smiled as if pleased with </p><p>the suggestion. Several members of the </p><p>board nodded. I arose to thank them. Two </p><p>hours later we were making preparations to </p><p>fly back over the North Pacific and into the </p><p>territory that had already become known to </p><p>airmen as the “Hot Spot”, and to the news </p><p>bulletins as the “Uncontrollable Destroyer”. </p><p>Some poetic intuition must have given the </p><p>phenomenon that name, for it seemed to </p><p>have certainly justified it even before a day </p><p>had passed. </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>The “Hot Spot” </p><p>OUR plane was the latest thing in </p><p>speedy aircraft. From her great Rick- </p><p>man-Conroff motor to her telescopic wings </p><p>she was an innovation. It might be men- </p><p>tioned here that her wings were, as the </p><p>name implies, capable of being “taken in” </p><p>after the ship left the ground, thus decreas- </p><p>ing resistance as the motor “revved up ’ </p><p>and she straightened out. We needed all </p><p>her wing surface to lift the heavily loaded </p><p>little ship off the ground, </p><p>but once in the air the </p><p>powerful motor pulled </p><p>her along with such force </p><p>that only half her maxi- </p><p>mum wing surface was </p><p>needed. </p><p>The work of telescop- </p><p>ing the wing was d^ne </p><p>with a tiny crank in the </p><p>control cabin. That ac- </p><p>complished, the plane </p><p>shot forward with the </p><p>speed of a bullet. Within </p><p>six hours we had covered </p><p>the distance to'where Cap- </p><p>tain Blaine had la?i seen </p><p>the “Hot Spot”. </p><p>At first we found 110 </p><p>trace of the phenomenon. </p><p>We flew for hours through all kinds of </p><p>weather, from rain and wind to heavy snow </p><p>and sleet. And all that time I was trying </p><p>to arrive at some conclusion as to the cause </p><p>of this supposed ray of heat, wondering if </p><p>it were the work of experimenters, or a </p><p>natural result of changes in the atmosphere, </p><p>or if it was a distorted sun ray. </p><p>Once we lilted through a maze of clouds </p><p>to look down upon a storm-torn strip of </p><p>land that we found to be one of the Aleu- </p><p>tian Island chain. Il was ihen that we de- </p><p>cided to turn to the northeast and fly slow- </p><p>ly to the coast of Alaska. Thus Captain </p><p>Blaine extended the wing surface of the </p><p>EDSEL NEWTON </p><p>806 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>plane and cut the motor down to a few </p><p>revolutions below cruising speed. We set- </p><p>tled back in comfort to study the skyline. </p><p>The sun was setting. </p><p>Blaine turned to me and said, “We’ll </p><p>never find it today—it follows the sun. I’m </p><p>sure it’s a ray, otherwise it would have re- </p><p>mained somewhere near the latitude in </p><p>which I first saw it."’ </p><p>I was still speculating as to this possi- </p><p>bility, and hardly answered him. We were </p><p>running down the Aleutians and an inter- </p><p>esting stretch of islands lay before and </p><p>beneath us. Then I saw something off to the </p><p>left that froze my eyes to the spot. Just </p><p>where the water met the land there was a </p><p>stretch of burned-over ground across a </p><p>tiny peninsula. It ended in the water again, </p><p>and began on the other side—just a burned </p><p>path that extended farther and was lost in </p><p>the distance. I pointed it out to Captain </p><p>Blaine. </p><p>Calm and cool, he did not speak, but </p><p>immediately kicked in the throttle, took in </p><p>some of the wing surface, and banked over </p><p>until the nose of the plane was pointed at </p><p>the spot. We came down upon it within a </p><p>few seconds and were following it out into </p><p>the northern wastes when I saw something </p><p>else that immediately caught and held my </p><p>attention. Ahead of us, and just over the </p><p>end of the wide path of fire and destruction, </p><p>was a bright ray of light that seemed to </p><p>extend up into the heavens until its source </p><p>was lost. And where it moved compara- </p><p>tively slowly toward the east it left on the </p><p>ocean a trail of boiling water and on land </p><p>a wake of charred surface. It seemed mov- </p><p>ing in the direction of Nome. </p><p>E were horrified, and yet we knew </p><p>that immediate action was necessary. </p><p>The heat left the air bumpy and rough, and </p><p>the plane was unsteady and hard to handle. </p><p>Captain Blaine was fighting the controls </p><p>as if he were steering an ocean liner in a </p><p>hurricane. We were soon wiping perspir- </p><p>ation from our brow. </p><p>“Got to get up and above it—find some </p><p>reason for it,” he mumbled. “I think it </p><p>drifts with the wind. You’ll notice that</p><p>every tailwind we get follows the path. Cur- </p><p>rents. Might miss Nome by a few milea.” </p><p>The air about us was getting hotter and </p><p>hotter. It became stifling. We could hard- </p><p>ly breathe. I thought Captain Blaine would </p><p>turn and run away from it, but instead he </p><p>gained altitude until we were at twenty- </p><p>three thousand feet, from which distance the </p><p>bright ray of fire look on a different aspect* </p><p>It seemed to be about a mile across; from </p><p>bottom to top it did not vary more than a </p><p>few yards. It continued lo move with the </p><p>wind like a huge cylinder, being blown </p><p>along. The radiation of heat was such that </p><p>we had to remain several miles away from </p><p>it. Sometimes we circled it, only to come </p><p>around again behind it and watch it cross </p><p>the tiny islands and leave the surface a </p><p>charred mass, dip into the sea and boil it </p><p>with the suddenness of a red hot iron being </p><p>dropped into a glass of water. </p><p>Captain Blaine ordered me to inform the </p><p>weather bureau and the officials of the </p><p>company of what we had found. Fred </p><p>Rrettner was on the telephone when I called </p><p>the offices of the International Airlines. No </p><p>sooner had I described the strange phantom </p><p>of destruction than he began making sug- </p><p>gestions, in spite of the static. “Fly above it </p><p>if you can -your plane is good for thirty- </p><p>six thousand feet, and she’s all metal. Pull </p><p>on your oxygen masks and dive into it a9 </p><p>far as you can. Bring back some idea as </p><p>to what causes it—I’ll have the government </p><p>patrol to your assistance if that will help.” </p><p>I thanked Brettner and hung up. Inform- </p><p>ing Blaine of his suggestion that we fly </p><p>above the cylinder of flame, the captain </p><p>immediately extended his wing surface and </p><p>kicked the throttle open. A few minutes </p><p>later we were at thirty-five thousand feet. </p><p>Our oxygen masks were adjusted and the </p><p>tanks were turned on. It was then that </p><p>Captain Blaine slowly edged into the path </p><p>of the cylinder, and we discovered that the </p><p>top of it was on an elevation of about thirty </p><p>thousand feet. He kept the nose of the plane </p><p>down in the direction of the ray until the </p><p>heat stifled us, and shot the plane several </p><p>thousand feet up into the sky, almost be- </p><p>fore we realized it. He fought with the </p><p>controls and he was nearly exhausted be- </p><p>fore they responded. I looked at the alti- </p><p>THE FLAMING CLOUD </p><p>807 </p><p>meter; forty-three thousand feet! And </p><p>directly below us was the flat top of that </p><p>cylindrical ray that so astounded us. It </p><p>was moving with the wind. </p><p>“A—chemical—compound of some kind!” </p><p>gasped the pilot at my side. “A freak of </p><p>nature—or an experiment of some sort run- </p><p>ning wild. Well—!” </p><p>The Moving Destroyer! </p><p>HE pointed off to the right, just over the </p><p>edge of the “ray”. A great plane hung </p><p>there, weaving in and out of the cloudy </p><p>edge of il, her motors full out, her nose </p><p>pointed downward into the face of the ter- </p><p>rific pressure of heavy air that came from </p><p>the hot spot. </p><p>“Why doesn’t he run away from it?” </p><p>screamed Blaine over the whirr of the mo- </p><p>tor to which he had given full throttle. He </p><p>nosed the plane downward into the face of </p><p>the pressure, and despite the great power </p><p>that pulled our plane, despite the fact that </p><p>our nose was pointed straight down, we </p><p>found difficulty in descending. We swel- </p><p>tered under the heat and gasped for breaths </p><p>of air from our oxygen tanks as we dived </p><p>straight into the top of the thing. </p><p>As we neared the great cylindrical cloud </p><p>it took on the aspect of a gaseous substance; </p><p>its color seemed to change as we looked </p><p>down into it; it was no longer a yellow </p><p>light ray; it became a cloud of vapor-like </p><p>stuff, but the temperature was the same. </p><p>We watched the other plane while our </p><p>motor strained in its effort to pull us down- </p><p>ward, and we saw that the great craft was </p><p>turning from the mass and flying away, </p><p>going off at an angle to escape the center </p><p>of that terrific updraft. </p><p>I suggested to Blaine to follow the other </p><p>plane. He pulled the nose up and shot out </p><p>toward it. It was apparently trying to </p><p>escape us, was almost out of sight before </p><p>we thought to take in some of our wing </p><p>surface and give chase. However, it was </p><p>not long before we were gaining on it, and </p><p>the mass of heat fell over the horizon be- </p><p>hind us. We were headed in the direction </p><p>of Seattle, with a strong wind pushing us</p><p>along. </p><p>“Get his number—don’t lose it!” Captain </p><p>Blaine shouted as we sped down upon the </p><p>tail of the fleeing ship. </p><p>“AF3675” I announced as we came along- </p><p>side the giant monoplane. </p><p>“Holy skyhooks! Where have I seen that </p><p>plane before?” exclaimed the captain. “Do </p><p>you see that tube running from the lower </p><p>side of the fuselage?” </p><p>“What has that to do with it?” I asked </p><p>excitedly. </p><p>“That's Professor Edwin Metter’s chem- </p><p>ical laboratory!” </p><p>“What—starting something he can’t </p><p>stop?” </p><p>“Met him when he dropped in for sup- </p><p>plies at Tokyo on my last run down there. </p><p>Thinks he has a way to change the climate </p><p>of the arctic regions. I guess it got away </p><p>from him.” </p><p>We flew down upon the other plane. Her </p><p>five great motors were wide open, but she </p><p>made little noise. I opened a window and </p><p>yelled through to a pale little man who </p><p>stood looking at us through an upper port </p><p>hole. Shamefaced, he opened the hinged </p><p>cover and tried to speak. </p><p>CHAPTER III. </p><p>Devastation! </p><p>THE shaky little man was plainly con- </p><p>fused. His hands played over the </p><p>port hole and his face twitched. The slip- </p><p>stream played havoc with his thick shock </p><p>of white hair. He had all the appearance </p><p>of a wild man, and yet his appearance was </p><p>pathetic enough to cause us to laugh in the </p><p>face of what appeared to be a great danger. </p><p>“I’ll manage it yet,” he screeched. “Got </p><p>the mixture too rich—too rich—too rich!” </p><p>“What does he mean—mixture too rich?” </p><p>I asked Captain Blaine. </p><p>“Ask him!” </p><p>My inquiring look brought an answer</p><p>from the professor. </p><p>“I—I—put too much of the—element that </p><p>caused the heal to form in the chemical— </p><p>going to Vancouver for more—got to stop </p><p>it before it gets to the coast!” </p><p>We had to think fast. I turned to Cap- </p><p>tain Blaine. “You have a faster ship—” </p><p>808 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>“But his plane is fitted to handle the </p><p>stuff—we'll run around and follow the </p><p>thing until he gets back.” And with that </p><p>Blaine swung the little plane about and </p><p>headed for the vicinity of the “Hot Spot.” </p><p>“Better report it to the office”, he sug- </p><p>gested. </p><p>“That’s a joke,” I said. “The static, even </p><p>down here, interferes too much. It has be- </p><p>come useless to try to talk. Hear nothing </p><p>but a crashing noise. It will rain torrents </p><p>around the cloud of fire.” </p><p>My prediction was true. When we again </p><p>came up with the sweeping, sweltering thing </p><p>we saw that storm clouds had rushed into </p><p>its wake. As darkness fell, torrents of rain </p><p>beat upon the plane. We changed our </p><p>course and fell in before it. Its speed was </p><p>slower now, but a breeze caused by the </p><p>piled-up air in its rear was pushing it along </p><p>toward the coast. I checked our position and </p><p>course and found that kind Providence had </p><p>directed the thing to the south of Nome. </p><p>We came upon the coast before we realized </p><p>it, and then what we feared began to hap- </p><p>pen. Everything within half a mile on </p><p>either side of the great cylindrical cloud </p><p>became scorched, and directly beneath it </p><p>great trees withered, became dry and blazed. </p><p>A path of absolute destruction a mile wide </p><p>was being cut across the Alaskan wilderness, </p><p>and we were drifting toward the Canadian </p><p>Northwest. </p><p>“We must get ahead and warn verybody!” </p><p>shouted Captain Blaine. He opened the </p><p>throttle wide and calculated the course of </p><p>the cloud. I looked back at it in the gath- </p><p>ering darkness. It took on a rose-colored </p><p>hue in the center; its now ragged sides </p><p>were blue and green and gold like a rain- </p><p>bow. What a magnificent thing it was! </p><p>And how useful, providing its elements were </p><p>not mixed wrongly. Knowing that I was </p><p>not likely to be familiar with the different </p><p>elements, the nervous little professor had </p><p>simply explained that “the mixture was too </p><p>rich.” </p><p>I could hardly contain myself for laugh- </p><p>ter at this pathetic little man who was so </p><p>frantic over the loss of control of his great</p><p>discovery. I could imagine him screeching </p><p>orders at airport attendants in an effort to </p><p>rush some of those strange chemioals </p><p>abroad. </p><p>WE preceded the chemical cloud about </p><p>two miles, but saw no sign of habi- </p><p>tation. Yet we knew that in our wake was </p><p>a strip a mile wide and many miles long </p><p>lying desolate because of this wild dream </p><p>of the little scientist. We hoped he would </p><p>return quickly. Before three hours had </p><p>passed we were far inland. The cloud </p><p>seemed to be disintegrating very slowly, but </p><p>when we flew near it still cast off a swelter- </p><p>ing heat that drove us away again. We </p><p>could do nothing but watch the progress of </p><p>this fool thing as it passed onward into </p><p>the interior. </p><p>Then came anxious moments. We were </p><p>coming upon a Canadian town. Blaine Hew </p><p>over, his siren open, yelling through the </p><p>cabin window to the people in the streets </p><p>below. Ihe cloud was only three or four </p><p>miles away, and headed directly for the cen- </p><p>ter of the village. They only half under- </p><p>stood, and yet they called others, and looked </p><p>off to the west. One family after another </p><p>took to planes, some of them crowded and </p><p>overloaded, but all of them managed to lift </p><p>from the tiny airport in the edge of the </p><p>town. </p><p>“Something must be done immediately!” </p><p>said the captain as we watched the planes </p><p>take off. The cloud was approaching the </p><p>town, destroying everything in its wake. We </p><p>flew about until the last plane had lifted and </p><p>then waited. The thing came down upon </p><p>that village like a cyclone, burning through </p><p>it and after leaving it a desolate wreck </p><p>veered off to the south toward a more thick- </p><p>ly populated area. We dreaded to think </p><p>of what might happen next. </p><p>We were flying about, helpless, fighting </p><p>the terrific air currents that resulted from </p><p>the heat. We raced down over farm- </p><p>houses and opened the siren. We rushed </p><p>to homes on both sides of the apparent </p><p>path of the thing and made all the noise </p><p>possible. We landed at a village present- </p><p>ly, some fifteen miles ahead of the cloud, </p><p>and found the place deserted save for a </p><p>single police plane that sat on the tarmac </p><p>at the village port.</p><p>THE FLAMING CLOUD </p><p>809 </p><p>“We got it by radio,” explained the of- </p><p>ficer. His red coat that had been quickly </p><p>buttoned reassured us, and we hurried on- </p><p>ward. We turned lo follow the cloud once </p><p>more. Just as we came upon it Professor </p><p>Metter’s plane caine burning the wind up </p><p>from the south. We recognized the ship </p><p>by the number we saw as we played our </p><p>floodlight over it. And then we saw the </p><p>brave little professor’s giant plane edge </p><p>into the top of that cloud, saw a stream </p><p>of liquid come from the tube and fall into </p><p>the densest part of it, saw it change from </p><p>its rosy-hue into a mild yellow, from that </p><p>into a haze, and finally into a bluish tint. </p><p>We knew he had brought the cloud under </p><p>control. </p><p>It is like getting ahead of the story to </p><p>have told you all this, but it is the way it </p><p>happened to us. Professor Metter ex- </p><p>plained it to us later as we ate a welcome </p><p>supper in a nearby roadside hotel. </p><p>“I had that fdea for years, but it was </p><p>difficult to get the correct compound. The </p><p>correct mixture of hydrogen and oxygen </p><p>and the other chemicals that go to the mak- </p><p>ing of this artificial atmosphere are cohe- </p><p>sive. as you have seen. I had a volatile al- </p><p>kaline base, but I couldn’t mix the elements </p><p>in the plane—there’d be an explosion. I </p><p>had to release one at a time from the dif- </p><p>ferent containers in the plane. The idea is </p><p>all right you’ll agree. Why, wherever the </p><p>wind blows that cloud for the next thirty </p><p>days people will have warm weather.” </p><p>An important looking man followed by </p><p>a crowd came up to our table and stood be- </p><p>fore the little professor. </p><p>“You have brought ruin upon farmers </p><p>across the entire country. There are re- </p><p>ports of houses being burned—” </p><p>“Was any one killed?” asked the excited </p><p>little man. </p><p>“No, but you’re going to face some big </p><p>damage suits,” said the man. </p><p>The professor pondered a minute. Then </p><p>he looked up at the man and said, “Not </p><p>far east of here lie the trackless wastes of</p><p>the Canadian wilds. The Canadian govern- </p><p>ment was the first to become interested in </p><p>my experiments. Canadian statesmen are </p><p>responsible for what 1 have done thus far. </p><p>They were interested because 1 promised an </p><p>Eden of tropical lands where now glitter </p><p>the snowy stretches of the great Northwest. </p><p>I am sure we can repay all losses in land.” </p><p>There was a moment of stunned silence. </p><p>A shout went up from the crowd, cheers </p><p>shook the house. They stopped when the </p><p>professor’s lips moved again. </p><p>“I can make a jungle out of the arctic, </p><p>a land of steaming forests and banana plan- </p><p>tations. There is no limit to the number </p><p>of chemical compounds. Don’t you agree </p><p>that it’s a wonderful discovery?” He </p><p>twiddled his thumbs and smiled upon the </p><p>speechless throng. </p><p>“It’s an astounding invention, all right,” </p><p>drawled Blaine. “But how about that </p><p>plane of mine? How did the stuff happen </p><p>to cut into lhat wing like a pair of scissors </p><p>and leave the rest of the ship intact?” </p><p>“I’ll—I’ll pay for that—I’ll make it </p><p>right!” said the nervous little professor. </p><p>“I got the mixture too rich!” </p><p>THE END </p><p>FOR “NEXT MONTH” </p><p>TURN TO PAGE 895 </p><p>See the announcement of the galaxy of science fiction stars </p><p>RAY CUMMINGS	P.

Sev- </p><p>eral scientific books were also prepared </p><p>from data obtained during the adventure. </p><p>As for my own part in this story I can </p><p>truthfully say it was inspired first by my </p><p>search for my sweetheart Marna, and sec- </p><p>ond by my natural love for indulging in </p><p>hazardous undertakings. I had the pow- </p><p>erful double objective of trying to find the </p><p>girl I loved and aiding in solving a mys- </p><p>tery which piqued the curiosity of all who </p><p>were acquainted with it. </p><p>The Sargasso Sea mystery, like many </p><p>other events of major importance, began </p><p>in a manner which excited passing but not </p><p>unusual interest. The disappearance of the </p><p>Marovia, a freighter carrying a cargo of cof- </p><p>fee from Rio de Janeiro, was the first link </p><p>in the chain of mystifying circumstances. </p><p>Prospects for the trip were favorable when </p><p>the Marovia left port. </p><p>When the freighter was two days out. the </p><p>Atlantic Coast Company, the corporation </p><p>which owned the ship received a radio mes- </p><p>sage that all was well and that an excep- </p><p>tional time record was apt to be set on the </p><p>810 </p><p>From the Ocean's Depth </p><p>Came the Terrible Threat </p><p>of Doom and Destruction! </p><p>Thin streamers of deep orange cut through the air like exploratory fingers. </p><p>In our terror, they were tentacles of some enemy. </p><p>trip. That was the last message ever re- </p><p>ceived from the ill-fated Marovia. </p><p>There was not even the customary S. 0. S. </p><p>of a vessel in distress. The ship had ap- </p><p>parently disappeared from the face of the </p><p>ocean. Vessels in that vicinity could give </p><p>no information on the supposed disaster. </p><p>The Marovia had simply failed to reach its </p><p>berth in the East River, New York. No </p><p>clues were discovered in the official inves- </p><p>tigation ordered by the owning company </p><p>following the strange disappearance. </p><p>At the lime the last radio message was </p><p>sent the Marovia had been in the general </p><p>vicinity of the Gulf Stream. She had last </p><p>been sighted in that vicinity by the Island </p><p>Queen, whose captain noted the fact in the </p><p>ship’s log and gave the customary greeting </p><p>811 </p><p>as the two vessels passed each other. The </p><p>captain of the Island Queen perceived noth- </p><p>ing wrong in the appearance of the Marovia. </p><p>The disappearance of the freighter was </p><p>given front page attention in the metro- </p><p>politan dailies but the announcement was </p><p>not accompanied by the excitement aroused </p><p>by subsequent reports of lost vessels. </p><p>Uneasiness became apparent in maritime </p><p>circles when a second ship failed to make </p><p>port. This time it was the St. Paul, a </p><p>Tropic Navigation steamer outbound from </p><p>New York. Its destination was a Central </p><p>American port. Again the last radio com- </p><p>munication from the. ill-fated boat was re- </p><p>ceived just before she reached the Gulf </p><p>Stream. It was a regular report stating </p><p>that all was well. But it was the last word </p><p>812 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>the owners ever received from the ship and </p><p>its crew of twenty-four men. </p><p>The probable fate of the two ships be- </p><p>came the topic of wide spread speculation. </p><p>Many persons wrote to the newspapers of- </p><p>fering possible explanations. Public dis- </p><p>cussion became so Strong that the United </p><p>Stales Government sent a Coast Guard boat </p><p>to the scene of the two </p><p>mysterious disappear- </p><p>ances. </p><p>Not even a final </p><p>radio message herald- </p><p>ed the disappearance </p><p>of the Coast Guard </p><p>vessel and its crew of </p><p>eight! </p><p>The affair had as- </p><p>sumed st-.ious propor- </p><p>tions by that time. </p><p>Freight carriage be- </p><p>tween the United </p><p>States and the tropics </p><p>was suffering. </p><p>As I look back on </p><p>that time of turbulence </p><p>in maritime circles it </p><p>seems that there was </p><p>a sort of regularity in </p><p>the way the boats </p><p>were reported missing. </p><p>Each was last heard </p><p>from in approximate- </p><p>ly the same Gulf </p><p>Stream location. The </p><p>disappearance occur- </p><p>red at intervals of </p><p>about every seven </p><p>days. Not once was </p><p>an S. O. S. picked up </p><p>by any of the stations </p><p>tuned in on the area. </p><p>Despite the fact </p><p>that traffic was considerably cut down on </p><p>ocean trails adjoining the mystery area a </p><p>total of thirty-four ships went to an un- </p><p>known fate in it. </p><p>DEPREDATIONS, if such they were, be- </p><p>came so drastic that the countries </p><p>whose maritime shipping was involved, by </p><p>international agreement forbade ships ven- </p><p>turing within a three-mile radius of the dan- </p><p>gerous territory. Special Coast Guard cut- </p><p>ters were assigned to the outer circle of the </p><p>radius to warn vessels, and if necessary </p><p>force them to abide by the ruling. A long </p><p>detour, agreed upon by the countries whose </p><p>commerce was threatened, provided a safe </p><p>but more costly and circuitous route. </p><p>A special investigation board was formed </p><p>by the Various ship </p><p>corporations. But ef- </p><p>forts of the board were </p><p>fruitless. </p><p>An attempt to solve </p><p>the mystery that at- </p><p>tracted wide spread </p><p>attention was the ex- </p><p>pedition fitted out by </p><p>the New York Times. </p><p>I cite it as an example </p><p>of what the press has </p><p>often done in the in- </p><p>terests of public safe- </p><p>ty- </p><p>There were t w o </p><p>ships in the Times ex- </p><p>pedition. It was </p><p>planned for them to </p><p>work independently. </p><p>Each was completely </p><p>outfitted w i t h the </p><p>most modern equip- </p><p>ment obtainable. </p><p>Much of tliis equip- </p><p>ment was donated by </p><p>sympathetic companies </p><p>and individuals. </p><p>Every known pre- </p><p>caution for sudden </p><p>emergencies was pro- </p><p>vided for in the equip- </p><p>ment. Naturally the </p><p>radio receiving and </p><p>sending sets were of </p><p>the most advanced types science could of- </p><p>fer. One of the noteworthy features of the </p><p>communication system was the use of radio </p><p>beams. The leaders of the Times expedi- </p><p>tion were assisted in working out details of</p><p>the radio beam use by scientists from the </p><p>Paldron Institute.* </p><p>•The radio beam had been experimented with </p><p>as far back as 1930 but did not come into </p><p>general use until some years later. </p><p>y TT7ITHIN the depths of\ </p><p>the seas reside some </p><p>of the most intriguing mys- </p><p>teries of nature. As far </p><p>down as we have gone, but </p><p>a few hundred feet, we </p><p>have already discovered </p><p>strange forms of fish life— </p><p>life that has adjusted it- </p><p>self to the great pressure </p><p>and the sunlessness and </p><p>airlessness of the watery </p><p>deeps. What might we find </p><p>at a depth of a mile or five </p><p>miles where the pressures </p><p>are terrific and the waters </p><p>intolerably cold? Man is </p><p>already attempting to find </p><p>out—for construction of a </p><p>diving equipment to go </p><p>down over a mile is on the </p><p>way. </p><p>It is also possible that </p><p>some time in the remote </p><p>past a great cataclysm may </p><p>have changed the forma- </p><p>tion of the earth and the </p><p>seas depths and produced </p><p>a type of life totally </p><p>strange to us. Whether this </p><p>story deals with that prob- </p><p>lem we cannot tell — for </p><p>there is a corking good air </p><p>of mystery here that we </p><p>cannot spoil by too many </p><p>^ hints.	f</p><p>DEATH FROM THE SEAS </p><p>813 </p><p>These radio beams (there was one for each </p><p>ship) operated from a land station located </p><p>on the Florida Coast. The continuous </p><p>beam emanated from the land station and </p><p>maintained constant communication with </p><p>both ships. The beam was registered on </p><p>tape, ticker machines being located on both </p><p>vessels as well as at the land station. Thus </p><p>the slightest deviation from the true course </p><p>by either ship would be instantly noted, </p><p>both by its companion craft and at the land </p><p>station. </p><p>Theoretically the radio beam idea was a </p><p>perfect method for maintaining constant </p><p>communication. Events following the start </p><p>of the expedition merely proved the fallacy </p><p>of placing entire faith in </p><p>a machine or a mechani- </p><p>cal arrangement. </p><p>Details were checked </p><p>and equipment thorough- </p><p>ly tested before the </p><p>Times expedition left </p><p>New York. Radio com- </p><p>munication with the two </p><p>vessels was maintained </p><p>satisfactorily, messages </p><p>being received many </p><p>times daily. </p><p>The first piece of </p><p>startling news from the </p><p>expedition came when a </p><p>message was flashed to </p><p>New York stating that a </p><p>life boat from the 5/. </p><p>Paul had been found. </p><p>The bodies of a man and a woman, charred </p><p>beyond recognition, were in the floating </p><p>hulk. </p><p>In the midst of this startling message, </p><p>communication was suddenly cut off with </p><p>the broadcasting ship. The unfinished </p><p>message was picked up by several stations. </p><p>Radio beam communication from the ship </p><p>also ceased abruptly. Then the radio beam </p><p>from the second ship suddenly terminated, </p><p>also. A listening world was literally kept </p><p>gasping. </p><p>Both ships in the Times expedition had </p><p>vanished as completely as had the other </p><p>crafts lost in that treacherous strip of sea. </p><p>A seaplane dispatched from the Florida </p><p>coast to search for possible wreckage on the </p><p>water might well have taken off for eternity. </p><p>Seen for the last lime winging out over the </p><p>sea, the fate of the plane, like that of the </p><p>ships, remained unknown, unlil the mystery </p><p>was finally cleared up. </p><p>The Times expedition has gone down in </p><p>history as a sincere but futile effort. The </p><p>names of those who lost their lives have </p><p>been remembered in the monument erected </p><p>to their heroism at Union Square. </p><p>You may think I am devoting too much </p><p>explanation to the expedition sent out by </p><p>the Times. But had it not been for that ex- </p><p>pedition I would never have become per- </p><p>sonally interested in the Sargasso Sea mys- </p><p>tery and with all modesty </p><p>I think I may add that </p><p>its secret would still be </p><p>locked in the ocean bos- </p><p>om. </p><p>Because Marna Mont- </p><p>gomery was aboard the </p><p>flag ship of the Times </p><p>outfit. And when Mar- </p><p>na disappeared I would </p><p>have used whatever puny </p><p>strength I possess in </p><p>moving heaven and </p><p>earth, if necessary, to dis- </p><p>cover her fate and solve </p><p>the horrid mystery of the </p><p>Sargasso. </p><p>Marna was a spirited </p><p>girl whose beauty was </p><p>matched by her impet- </p><p>uosity. As a woman reporter on the Times </p><p>she had had her share of journalistic thrills. </p><p>But when plans for the Times expedition to </p><p>the. Sargasso Sea were announced, Marna </p><p>forthwith decided that the job “covering” </p><p>that undertaking was to be the crowning </p><p>jewel in her list of newspaper exploits. </p><p>She would listen to no entreaties against </p><p>undertaking the perilous voyage. But she </p><p>did agree that when she returned finis was </p><p>to be written on her professional career. </p><p>She agreed then to become my wife and</p><p>settle down to the comparatively prosaic </p><p>task of juggling the salary of a wireless </p><p>telegrapher. At the time I was serving on </p><p>JOSEPH KENNELLY </p><p>814 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>the Toltec, which plied between New York </p><p>and Cuba. </p><p>Imagine my anguish then, when that last </p><p>radio message from the Times expedition </p><p>was cut short. For a time I thought I </p><p>would actually lose my mind. Then it was </p><p>that my company decided to sponsor a fin- </p><p>al effort to clear up the mystery. I eager- </p><p>ly volunteered and because of my know- </p><p>ledge of wireless Lelegraphv was accepted </p><p>lor the hazardous undertaking. </p><p>The company was in really dire financial </p><p>straits as a result of the unexplained ocean- </p><p>ic tragedies. Eight of its best ships bad </p><p>gone into the maw of the Sargasso. Their </p><p>loss had disrupted the freight-carrying sche- </p><p>dule and because immediate adjustments </p><p>bad been necessitated, many of the most </p><p>profitable contracts had been lost. Then, </p><p>too, the cost of operation had been mater- </p><p>ially increased by the addition of the 700- </p><p>mile detour prescribed by the government. </p><p>THE route of the Toltec did not quite </p><p>penetrate the forbidden area, although </p><p>our course was near the scene of disaster. </p><p>At that our proximity to that portion of the </p><p>sea aroused fearful apprehension on the </p><p>part of many of the sailors. Personally I </p><p>have never subscribed to the superstitions </p><p>of either land or sea. I felt that there must </p><p>be some human agency or logical explana- </p><p>tion behind the disappearance. </p><p>So when my company decided to make a </p><p>final desperate effort to solve the mystery, </p><p>1 pressed my claim as a member of the </p><p>party. To be frank there were not many </p><p>volunteers and my personal interest in </p><p>solving the riddle aided me in securing one </p><p>of the two berths open. </p><p>Officials of the company had decided </p><p>against sending a large vessel into the area. </p><p>They reasoned that this had been unsuccess- </p><p>ful in previous attempts and that a smaller </p><p>craft would probably have a better chance. </p><p>The plan was outlined to me by McAnd- </p><p>rews, terminal superintendent, at a confer- </p><p>ence of line officials to which I was sum- </p><p>moned. </p><p>He explained: </p><p>“The plan we have finally decided upon </p><p>is to send a small motorboat carrying only </p><p>two men into the area. </p><p>“We shall take all possible precautions </p><p>to insure your safety but after you reach </p><p>the area the rest will depend on yourselves.” </p><p>He motioned to a silent figure half-con- </p><p>cealed by the shadows in one corner of the </p><p>room. With a start 1 recognized Novak! </p><p>Realization that I was to have that famous </p><p>adventurer as my companion added zest </p><p>to the affair. </p><p>But McAndrews was continuing: </p><p>“We believe that you will have a good </p><p>chance as you will not be hampered with a </p><p>large vessel which may attract the attention </p><p>of your unknown enemy, if there is an ene- </p><p>my. </p><p>“This simple plan may succeed where the </p><p>more elaborate attempts of others have </p><p>failed. If it doesn't—well it means the fin- </p><p>ancial ruin of those who are left behind.” </p><p>After the plan had been thoroughly out- </p><p>lined to Novak and myself, we were given </p><p>an opportunity to change our minds if we </p><p>wished. McAndrews and the others who </p><p>sat about ihe conference table impressed </p><p>upon us the dangerous nature of the mis- </p><p>sion and urged us to withdraw if we felt </p><p>any hesitancy in the matter. </p><p>Spurred on by eagerness to discover some </p><p>clue lo Marna’s fate I eagerly waived all </p><p>suggestions that it was not too late to with- </p><p>draw. Novak was equally determined lo </p><p>go. In his strange career the unknown had </p><p>always exercised a peculiar fascination for </p><p>him. A tragedy of his early manhood had </p><p>apparently robbed him of the desire to live. </p><p>He had engaged in one mad adventure after </p><p>another, always emerging with his ill-prized </p><p>life. </p><p>McAndrews admonished: </p><p>“I must remind you that the chances of </p><p>your emerging alive from this undertaking </p><p>are absolutely against you.” </p><p>Then finally he said: “Do you still wish </p><p>to go?”</p><p>There was a moment’s silence in the </p><p>room. </p><p>Then I said: “I am perfectly willing to </p><p>take the risk.” Adding: “There is only </p><p>one reason for hesitancy on my part.” </p><p>McAndrews asked quickly: </p><p>DEATH FROM THE SEAS </p><p>815 </p><p>“What is that?” </p><p>I replied: “That is that my mother shall </p><p>suffer no financial embarrassment ii I am </p><p>lost.” </p><p>‘‘You need feel no worry on that score,” </p><p>McAndrews replied. “She will be well </p><p>provided for as long as she lives ,if you </p><p>fail to return.” </p><p>Novak, always a man of few words, gave </p><p>an almost taciturn affirmative to McAnd- </p><p>rews. </p><p>As this time I think it opportune to tell </p><p>you something about Novak. As the com- </p><p>pany’s foreign representative he traveled al- </p><p>most constantly and was a familiar figure </p><p>in the picturesque ports of call on our line’s </p><p>routes. He had figured in several Central </p><p>and South America peccadillos and had </p><p>weathered the storms of political intrigue </p><p>many times. </p><p>More than six feet tall and of athletic </p><p>build he was a commanding figure. Al- </p><p>though reserved, his mien was pleasant and </p><p>his personality attracted and held attention </p><p>wherever he went. His indomitable </p><p>strength of character was reflected in pierc- </p><p>ing gray eyes and an aggressive profile. </p><p>His blond hair was streaked with gray. </p><p>Varied adventure had punctuated his car- </p><p>eer even as a young man. The countries to </p><p>the South of us had always interested him </p><p>and he had engaged in their turbulent poli- </p><p>tics, to his later sorrow. While in his ear- </p><p>ly twenties he had wooed and won a Span- </p><p>ish girl, noted for her beauty and intellect- </p><p>ual attainments. They had removed to a </p><p>South American rancho presented to Novak </p><p>by a grateful friend, whom he had rendered </p><p>a valorous service. </p><p>Then revolution flamed across the coun- </p><p>try and Novak’s wife fell a victim to its </p><p>brutalities. She was captured and her exe- </p><p>cution ordered by the revolutionary chief- </p><p>tain. Novak, who was absent from home at </p><p>the time, attributed the cold blooded mur- </p><p>der to personal malice directed toward him- </p><p>self. </p><p>A short time later the governor’s palace </p><p>resounded to the shrieks of servants who dis- </p><p>covered that the revolutionary leader and </p><p>his entire family had fallen victim to a </p><p>*wift and little known poison. The multi- </p><p>ple murder was never conclusively proven </p><p>to have been done by Novak although the </p><p>crime was generally acknowledged and even </p><p>applauded in some circles as a just revenge.* </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>The Derelict </p><p>THE United States Government was </p><p>quick to oiler its aid to the company </p><p>for the perilous undertaking. Navy sea- </p><p>planes were stationed at our Florida Coast </p><p>base and other aids offered us. </p><p>We flew from New York to Florida. Both </p><p>Novak and myself were quiet and thought- </p><p>ful on the trip. We did not attempt much </p><p>conversation. Partly due to our own in- </p><p>clinations and partly due to the monotonous </p><p>roar of the three powerful Diesel engines </p><p>our plane was powered with. </p><p>Fantastic thoughts and improbable theor- </p><p>ies flashed through my mind on that trip. </p><p>Theories which I had seen advanced in the </p><p>columns of science fiction story magazines </p><p>permeated my mind and I toyed with var- </p><p>ious ideas inspired by these stories, of which </p><p>I had read many, and tried to adapt them to </p><p>the problem at hand. Novak appeared to </p><p>be sunk in an introspective mood. </p><p>The plane winged south at a fast clip. </p><p>Air travel was no novelty to me and I took </p><p>slight interest in the panoramic vistas which </p><p>unfolded beneath us. In fact with the pros- </p><p>pect of our great adventure before me the </p><p>flight proved rather boresome and 1 sighed </p><p>and stretched with relief when we deplaned </p><p>at Key West. </p><p>An official United States Army car met </p><p>us at the air field and took us to the dock </p><p>where a Coast Guard boat was awaiting us. </p><p>We boarded the cutter and soon were on our </p><p>way to the edge of the forbidden area. There </p><p>our motor boat was lowered over the side </p><p>and we bade those aboard the cutter a sober </p><p>farewell. </p><p>Our motor boat was a small, compactly </p><p>built craft. It had two small cabins of cub-</p><p>by hole proportions. A heavy sea would </p><p>•This attitude toward the affair was taken by </p><p>the author of an article on Novak's colorful </p><p>career which appeared in The New Republic, </p><p>pages 66 to 64, in April, 19J3. </p><p>816 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>have speedily capsized our floating home </p><p>but as the tropical storm season was past </p><p>we had little to fear in the way of weather. </p><p>Food and fuel sufficient for a month’s cruise </p><p>were on board, although we hoped to satis- </p><p>factorily end our mission in much less time </p><p>than that. </p><p>When we shook hands with officers aboard </p><p>the Coast Guard boat, it was apparent that </p><p>they never expected to see us alive again. </p><p>We were serious, naturally, and the good- </p><p>byes of our companions were almost dis- </p><p>heartening. </p><p>Soon we were flashing through the spark- </p><p>ling sea and thoughts of death and danger </p><p>semed far away as we reveled in the mo- </p><p>tion of the smoothly performing boat. Our </p><p>motors, there were two, vibrated gently and </p><p>soon we were in ihe midst of the dreaded </p><p>area. The “V” edge of our bow cut the </p><p>water like a knife and sent pearly cascades </p><p>of water back in a delicate shower. </p><p>1 was at the wheel. We had worked out </p><p>a plan whereby we would stand three-hour </p><p>tricks at the wheel during the daylight hours </p><p>and float at night. Ast we had no particular </p><p>goal and could ascertain our position at </p><p>any time by instruments this plan was cal- </p><p>culated to conversed our strength for the </p><p>vigilant search we planned to make. </p><p>We cruised about ihe area all of that first </p><p>day noting nothing unusual. I began to </p><p>penetrate Novak’s shell of taciturnity and </p><p>discover the qualities that cemented our </p><p>lasting friendship. The loneliness of our </p><p>surroundings, the nature of our mission and </p><p>the sense-quickening qualities of being in </p><p>a death defying adventure together, rapidly </p><p>ripened our association from superficial to </p><p>deep friendship. </p><p>On the third day out we discovered our </p><p>first clue. It was also the first actual inti- </p><p>mation of the amazing, incredible adventure </p><p>which befell us. </p><p>I was standing at the bow, scanning the </p><p>horizon, while Novak stood his turn at the </p><p>wheel. The monotonous vista I was gazing </p><p>at was at once dismal and disgusting. </p><p>Much of this portion of the sea was cov- </p><p>ered with a weed from which a nauseating </p><p>stench arose. The thick, greenish scum, </p><p>which i6 characteristic of the Sargasso </p><p>alone, covered the sea weed. The odor was </p><p>an abominable one. In fact it was all but </p><p>unbearable. I do not consider myself a </p><p>squeamish person but that retching smell </p><p>all but made me ill. </p><p>Our very food seemed permeated by it </p><p>and the consumption of meals became an </p><p>almost unbearable ordeal. </p><p>On this particular day as I stood at the </p><p>bow 1 was reflecting on the vagaries of ihe </p><p>human mind. I thought of the inadequate </p><p>existence most of us lead, immersed in self- </p><p>ish desires; sating them; engaging in war- </p><p>fare less human than that waged by the </p><p>lower animals: and withal complacently </p><p>contented with ourselves. Pictures of our </p><p>self-important business men, the executives </p><p>in our big cities, occurred to me and 1 </p><p>thought how insignificant their might was </p><p>when compared to that of nature. </p><p>Thoughts of this kind usually lead to bit- </p><p>ter introspection and then develop into a </p><p>morbid contemplation of our daily existence </p><p>which is detrimental in a mental sense. This </p><p>psychological phenomena is interesting and </p><p>absolutely true, as any student of the science </p><p>will tell you. I was deeply buried in self- </p><p>pitying introspection when an excited sound </p><p>from Novak brought me out of my reverie </p><p>with a start. </p><p>Glancing up, my startled gaze encountered </p><p>the looming bulk of the nearly unrecogniz- </p><p>able hull of the Marovia, the first ship which </p><p>had disappeared in the Sargasso Sea. </p><p>SHE was tipped sluggishly to one side </p><p>and rolling slightly. Her sides were </p><p>charred and encrusted with green scum. The </p><p>sides and hull looked as though fierce fire </p><p>had swept them. Yet the masts, stanchions </p><p>and cargo booms were untouched. The </p><p>steel sides appeared to have borne the brunt </p><p>of the devasting flame. </p><p>But the phenomena I hat later aroused my </p><p>excited cry was not immediately noted by </p><p>me. When my roving gaze did rest on it, </p><p>I gasped. It was this. The entire bow of </p><p>the vessel, from rail to waterline, and from</p><p>the end of the wrell deck through the fore- </p><p>castle, was one mass of fused metal. </p><p>It looked as though some shaft of super- </p><p>heat, like veritable fingers from hell, had </p><p>DEATH FROM THE SEAS </p><p>817 </p><p>reached out and melted the metal in the </p><p>ship. The vastness of the destruction was </p><p>appalling. I knew that no instrument known </p><p>to the world could wreak such havoc. I </p><p>I	shuddered at thoughts too horrible to</p><p>voice. </p><p>Novak and I stood speechless. A cold </p><p>sweat had broken out on us. </p><p>Finally Novak regained a measure of his </p><p>composure and said: </p><p>“I guess we’d better board her.” </p><p>Although the prospect was temporarily </p><p>unnerving to me 1 borrowed from Novak’s </p><p>calm and prepared to aid him in pulling </p><p>our boat alongside the spectral Marovia. </p><p>It had become increasingly difficult for </p><p>our craft to move through the water before </p><p>we spied the wrecked ship and it was with </p><p>real difficulty that we forced our small boat </p><p>through the clinging fields of sea weed and </p><p>finally pulled up against the Marovia. Ty- </p><p>ing our craft to what had once been the </p><p>anchor chain of the stricken boat, we be- </p><p>gan clambering up its side. </p><p>More than once I cursed to myself during </p><p>that climb. Jagged pieces of splintered </p><p>steel tore at my flesh and clothing. Novak, </p><p>as usual, stood the ordeal with fortitude. </p><p>My audible sigh of relief, when we reach- </p><p>ed the deck, sounded strangely loud on that </p><p>freighter which once had proudly plowed </p><p>through gale swept seas. </p><p>“We’d better take a look at the deck and </p><p>the staterooms first.” Novak suggested. </p><p>There was nothing on the deck or </p><p>bridge to arouse comment. Then we started </p><p>a tour of the staterooms. As you know </p><p>every freighter has a few staterooms re- </p><p>served for the use of infrequent passengers </p><p>and company officials. </p><p>In every cabin we found the same condi- </p><p>tion. Floors had been ripped up and walls </p><p>demolished. The significant fact was that </p><p>while apparently nothing else had been</p><p>taken every bit of steel was gone. </p><p>A ghastly revelation awaited us at the </p><p>end of the deck. Those aboard had evident- </p><p>ly fled for protection to the last stateroom </p><p>and barricaded the door against some ene- </p><p>my, unknown to us. This door had evident- </p><p>ly been literally burned from its hinges. </p><p>Although constructed of thin sheet metal it </p><p>apparently had been an easy matter to pene- </p><p>trate it with a weapon powerful enough to </p><p>inflict the damage we had already noted on </p><p>the steel bow and other parts of the ship. </p><p>Huddled in the far corner of the room </p><p>were the pitiful remains of the ill-starred </p><p>crew and passengers. Charred corpses, </p><p>burned to a crisp, were piled in a grotesque </p><p>heap. </p><p>Softly cursing. Novak surveyed the hor- </p><p>rible scene. </p><p>Finally in an awed voice I asked: “How </p><p>do you explain it?” </p><p>“The only theory I could advance is still </p><p>hazy,” Novak replied. “I must find more </p><p>corroborating evidence before attributing it </p><p>to more than distorted imagination.” </p><p>Then, after a moment of thought— </p><p>“I will say this much, though, because it </p><p>is proven by the evidence before our eyes; </p><p>a heat ray of some kind is involved in this </p><p>tragedy. </p><p>“Look at the condition of the ship’s bow, </p><p>this door, and those,” motioning to the pile </p><p>of bodies, “that is the only way those things </p><p>can be explained.’’ </p><p>“I had somewhat the same thought, </p><p>Novak,” I admitted. “But it seemed so fan- </p><p>tastic I hesitated to voice it.” </p><p>Thoughtfully Novak replied: “The idea at </p><p>first seems improbable to us because it is a </p><p>radical departure from anything we are </p><p>familiar with. “But the use of a powerful </p><p>heat ray is no new idea in the scientific </p><p>world. As far back as 1789 the possibility </p><p>of such a ray was mentioned and experi- </p><p>mented with unsuccessfully.” </p><p>“A German made progress with the idea</p><p>in 1928 and did actually develop a ray of </p><p>comparatively small effectiveness. He kill- </p><p>ed rats, guinea pigs and small animals dur- </p><p>ing his experiments. </p><p>“In a reverse manner the ray was used </p><p>to promote the growth of vegetables. With </p><p>a milder application than that used on the </p><p>animals he was able to cut in half the time </p><p>usually required for a tree lo mature. </p><p>“You have heard of the vibratory ray </p><p>which wrecked the Harvard laboratories in </p><p>1936 killing all those who knew the secret </p><p>of the invention. </p><p>“To explain the theory in a simple way, </p><p>818 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>I -will cite tte well known fact that a sub- </p><p>stance the size of a football heated to </p><p>the surface temperature of the sun would </p><p>shrivel any human being or inanimate ob- </p><p>ject within a radius of a half-mile. </p><p>OW suppose you had a fragment of </p><p>— JIN such a substance and put it in a </p><p>tube insulated at all points except a small </p><p>opening in the front. Thus the heat could </p><p>travel out of the tube in only one direction, </p><p>namely the front. </p><p>“Assume, too, that by pressing a tiny but- </p><p>ton you could set into operation apparatus </p><p>that would heat this theoretical fragment </p><p>to the temperature necessary for your pur- </p><p>pose.

Now I be- </p><p>lieve something similar to this theoretical </p><p>rav I have been describing has been used </p><p>here.” </p><p>He paused leaving me gaping in wonder. </p><p>Finally, motioning to the mute group, I </p><p>asked: “Who do you think is responsible </p><p>for this wholesale destruction?” </p><p>“Your guess is as good as mine,” Novak </p><p>replied. “So far as I can see nothing has </p><p>been removed from the ship but steel. Why </p><p>all these lives should have been taken I </p><p>don’t know. There was no mercenary ad- </p><p>vantage to the attackers as the ship carried </p><p>no bullion. The cargo has been left un- </p><p>touched, as you can see. </p><p>“A nation seeking to ruin our marine com- </p><p>merce would not operate in this manner. </p><p>Besides many vessels have been lost which </p><p>belonged to countries other than ours. No, </p><p>Bob, I am afraid our solution lies else- </p><p>where.” </p><p>This rather excited conversation had been </p><p>carried on as we stood beside that pitiful </p><p>pile of dead. Now our thoughts came back</p><p>to it. </p><p>“We can at least give them a decent bur- </p><p>ial.” Novak suggested. </p><p>A search for canvas revealed that and </p><p>some strong cord in the ship’s storeroom. </p><p>Returning with the canvas and cord we be- </p><p>gan the ghastly task of sewing the bodies </p><p>into individual sacks and weighting them. </p><p>Twilight was on us before we finished so </p><p>we decided to postpone the actual burial </p><p>until morning. </p><p>Although we made a brave attempt nei- </p><p>their of us at much that night. And I must </p><p>confess we slept but little. Rising early we </p><p>prepared to finish our self-appointed grue- </p><p>some task. </p><p>While Novak prepared our breakfast I </p><p>decided to look over the wireless appar- </p><p>atus on the ship. I wanted to find out why </p><p>the operator had not sent out an S.O.S. in </p><p>the face of such imminent danger. </p><p>Looking over the equipment I found </p><p>everything to be in perfect order. So far </p><p>as I could discover the wireless apparatus </p><p>was functioning smoothly. I got a satisfac- </p><p>tory spark in testing the set and decided </p><p>that whatever disturbance had interfered </p><p>with the sending of a message had been only </p><p>temporary. </p><p>I thought of sending a message out over </p><p>the set but hesitated for fear whatever enemy </p><p>was responsible for the condition of the </p><p>Marovia might pick up the code. </p><p>After a breakfast devoid of conversation, </p><p>Novak and I went forward with the burial. </p><p>He had found a Bible in the captain’s cabin </p><p>and read from it. As the solemn intonations </p><p>of Novak’s voice pronounced the scriptural </p><p>passages he had selected, I let the bodies </p><p>slide over the rail, one by orte, into the </p><p>placid water. </p><p>After the last body had been lowered to </p><p>its watery grave, we stood with bowed heads </p><p>for a moment. The sunshine was stream- </p><p>ing down on us but it failed to lighten the </p><p>gloom of our spirits. The water which had </p><p>engulfed more than a score of bodies ceas- </p><p>ed to gurgle and as it became calm again </p><p>a large field of greenish sea grass floated</p><p>over the fatal spot. </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>Fingers of Doom </p><p>FOLLOWING the emotional strain of </p><p>the burial neither Novak nor myself </p><p>DEATH FROM THE SEAS </p><p>819 </p><p>felt like continuing our explorations that </p><p>day. We had previously tied our motor boat </p><p>to the side of the Marovia and by tacit </p><p>agreement remained there that day. </p><p>We were standing in the bow of the </p><p>Marovia discussing our next move. I </p><p>broached the idea of continuing our search </p><p>for the other lost vessels but Novak vetoed </p><p>this suggestion pointing out that we had by </p><p>no means completely examined the derelict </p><p>we were aboard. </p><p>Suddenly I noticed Novak grow tense, as </p><p>though some sight or sound had aroused </p><p>his suspicion. He thrust a warning hand </p><p>on my arm as I started to speak. Then I </p><p>heard it, too. </p><p>A low humming whirr which rose rapidly </p><p>to a high pitched whine. The very air seem- </p><p>ed to vibrate with the unusual force of the </p><p>sound. It seemed to be coming from the </p><p>side of the ship, and beneath it. </p><p>Cautiously creeping to the side of the </p><p>Marovia I peered overboard. At first I saw </p><p>nothing. Then I noticed a queer and un- </p><p>natural effulgence coming up from the </p><p>murky depths of the ocean. </p><p>Some phosphorescent object seemed to be </p><p>coming to the surface. The water began to </p><p>boil and I saw that a circle of clear water </p><p>was rapidly widening as the sea weed and </p><p>other surface material was forced back. </p><p>Then I saw it! Rising out of the water </p><p>its phosphorescent sides dripped with wa- </p><p>ter. Similar in some ways to a submarine </p><p>it had the same elongated shape with a </p><p>fuller looking tower that alone marred the </p><p>symmetry of its smooth lines. There were </p><p>no ballast tanks along the sides, either. </p><p>The motors ceased their eerie whine as </p><p>the thing rose to the top of the water. A </p><p>curious silence followed. </p><p>I cannot with mere words describe the </p><p>queer machine I beheld. It was larger than </p><p>a submarine and its entire outer surface was </p><p>covered with a series of scales, similar to </p><p>those found on a fish. The scale-like cover- </p><p>ing produced the phosphorescence I had</p><p>first noted. Yet there was no sign of aquatic </p><p>life in the object. It was unquestionably a </p><p>machine powered with some type of motor </p><p>strange to us. </p><p>The queer craft came to a halt except for </p><p>a gentle rocking back and forth occasioned </p><p>by the waves. Then a section of the top slid </p><p>back with a grating noise. </p><p>Novak hissed in my ear: </p><p>“Hide! God knows what is in there.” </p><p>Instantly I whirled and with Novak close </p><p>behind me ran towards the middle of the </p><p>boat. Our running feet made a reverberat- </p><p>ing sound on the empty deck and the next </p><p>moment I was cursing our folly at having </p><p>forgotten that. Continuing, though, we </p><p>dived into hiding behind a pile of tarpaulin </p><p>slung carelessly into a heap on the deck. </p><p>Crouching there we heard a shrill whistle. </p><p>The sound resembled the siren on a fire </p><p>truck more than anything else I could as- </p><p>sociate it with. </p><p>Peering from our hiding place we noticed </p><p>a blue radiance which slowly became visible </p><p>in the air about us. It rapidly grew in out- </p><p>line and began to assume a definite shape. </p><p>Benumbing fear sent fingers of ice to con- </p><p>strict my heart.	;</p><p>The radiance continued to grow in in- </p><p>tensity until a well defined aura of blue </p><p>flame enveloped the entire ship. There was </p><p>a charged feeling in the air as though elec- </p><p>tricity might be the force back of the phen- </p><p>omena. </p><p>Gradually the aura of blue flame began to </p><p>localize and change to a deep purple hue. It </p><p>was a magnificent display of force for which </p><p>I had no doubt there was a perfectly natur- </p><p>al origin or explanation. </p><p>Every color in the spectrum now became </p><p>apparent. Thin streamers of a deep orange </p><p>color cut through the air like exploratory </p><p>fingers. They wavered, groping, toward the </p><p>the dim corners of the deck. They almost </p><p>seemed possessed of an intelligence of their </p><p>own as they slid along the rail as if in </p><p>search of something. </p><p>In our terror it seemed to us they were </p><p>tentacles of some malignant enemy reach- </p><p>ing out to find us. I gasped involuntarily </p><p>as the full force of that idea struck me. </p><p>Blind, unreasoning fear began to flow </p><p>through my veins and pervade my very be- </p><p>ing. Shivering violently, I crouched lower. </p><p>Then the scene began to turn black. It </p><p>seemed to me that a veritable sash of crepe </p><p>820 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>was falling across my son I. In the com- </p><p>plete absence of light the darkness itself </p><p>seemed to be possessed of substance. </p><p>The darkness lifted for a moment. All </p><p>was quiet. And then I heard Novak cry </p><p>out. His hoarse scream sounded distant and </p><p>unreal. It ended abruptly as though some </p><p>antagonistic hand had reached out and </p><p>throttled him. </p><p>Lurid light was shed on the deck for an </p><p>instant by a brilliant purple flash which </p><p>caused me to fall back. By that time I felt </p><p>as if the foundations of my sanity were </p><p>reeling. I seemed to be living a horrible, </p><p>inconceivable nightmare. </p><p>THEN I realized that the flash had seared </p><p>me, scorching my hair, brows and </p><p>lashes and all but burning the clothes from </p><p>my body. </p><p>I screamed and heard no sound. I beat </p><p>my hands in futility against my breast and </p><p>felt agonizing pain as a result. I had a </p><p>mad impulse to throw myself over the rail. </p><p>Rising to follow that impulse, which to </p><p>my disordered mind seemed a desirable end </p><p>to my horrid dream, I felt something cold </p><p>and clammy clinging to me. I also had a </p><p>burning sensation in my back, not unlike </p><p>that produced by contact with certain kinds </p><p>of fish which have the power of inflicting </p><p>terrible electric burns. </p><p>Terrible pain shot through the small of </p><p>my back. Then I stumbled with outflung </p><p>arms and sank into the depths of merciful </p><p>oblivion .... </p><p>1 seemed to be floating on air. There was </p><p>a curious feeling of elation in my body. </p><p>Briefly, as I regained consciousness the </p><p>menial predominated over the physical. </p><p>Then I became aware of my aches and pains. </p><p>I saw that one of my arms was blackened </p><p>and blistered. Pain was coursing through </p><p>my entire body in a steady, unceasing </p><p>rhythm. I cried out involuntarily and al- </p><p>most fainted from the pain. </p><p>Through the mists that were beginning </p><p>to clear before my eyes, I saw Novak look-</p><p>ing down at me anxiously. </p><p>“Where are we?” 1 managed to gasp. </p><p>Novak admonished me to lie quietly for </p><p>a few momenta. </p><p>My eyes wandered about and I noticed </p><p>I was in a fairly large bed. The room was </p><p>small and furnished in an unimaginative </p><p>fashion which was depressing. There were </p><p>no splashes of color, no attempts at beauty </p><p>in the room. Everything was in a low </p><p>monotonous brown hue. The ceiling was </p><p>low, being barely six feet I judged, and the </p><p>whole room seemed to be swaying gently. </p><p>A dim blue light which seemed to be the </p><p>room's sole illumination exuded from the </p><p>ceiling, though not localized at any de- </p><p>finite point. The floor had a fluffy cover- </p><p>ing, not unlike cotton in its natural state, </p><p>which was in the prevailing shade of brown. </p><p>Novak’s voice a9 he talked had a strain- </p><p>ed quality which I attributed to the evident </p><p>sound proof qualities thal had been used </p><p>in the construction of the room. I focused </p><p>my wandering thoughts on what he was say- </p><p>ing: </p><p>“—afler I screamed I felt something on </p><p>my face. Then I lost consciousness and </p><p>when I awoke I was lying on that bed with </p><p>you. </p><p>“Once after I regained consciousness I </p><p>saw a section of the wall slide back and </p><p>some kind of a robot entered the room. </p><p>Somewhat on the type of Eros and those </p><p>other Robots exhibited at Haddon Hall not </p><p>long ago. It left food here and later re- </p><p>turned with a bottle of something that tasted </p><p>like some kind of brandy. I forced some </p><p>of the liquid down your throat. You revived </p><p>—and here we are.” </p><p>“But how long have we been here?” I </p><p>inquired weakly. </p><p>“I regained consciousness several hours </p><p>ago but of course I do not know how long </p><p>I remained unconscious,” Novak replied. </p><p>“What are we going to do?” I asked im- </p><p>patiently. “For all we know we may be </p><p>headed toward the bottom of the ocean.” </p><p>“You have diagnosed our course better </p><p>than you think.” Novak smiled grimly. “See </p><p>what I discovered a while ago.” </p><p>Approaching the far wall he pressed a </p><p>button invisible to me. The wall slid back </p><p>revealing an outer transparent wall such as </p><p>those used in the submarines of the Paldron </p><p>Institute sub-sea research department. </p><p>I managed to stagger over and press my </p><p>DEATH FROM THE SEAS </p><p>821 </p><p>forehead against this wall. The water was </p><p>flashing by on the outside and showed that </p><p>we must be traveling at a high rate of </p><p>6peed. How high I had no means of cal- </p><p>culating. </p><p>Afraid to believe what T could plainly </p><p>see, I retorted: “Nonsense, perhaps we are </p><p>just below the water line.” </p><p>“No, you saw it when it rose out of the </p><p>water” Novak replied quietly. “It is un- </p><p>doubtedly a submersible of some kind. Then, </p><p>too, there have been several times when I </p><p>could plainly tell that we were descending </p><p>at a sharp angle.” </p><p>“But what’s it all about?” I asked desper- </p><p>ately . </p><p>“The Lord only knows, but we have cer- </p><p>tanly bumped into something we are entirely </p><p>unacquainted with or prepared for.” </p><p>We continued to thrash about conver- </p><p>sationally in search of a satisfactory theory </p><p>for our situation when suddenly a low </p><p>sound warned us we were no longer alone. </p><p>Turning 1 surveyed the man who had en- </p><p>tered. </p><p>IN stature he was short almost to the </p><p>point of being a dwarf. His legs were </p><p>almost ridiculously small and undeveloped. </p><p>His hands, too, were abnormally small as </p><p>was his torso. </p><p>His head attracted my attention. It was </p><p>enormous in comparison with the rest of </p><p>his body. His broad forehead sloped back </p><p>to a head which was entirely without hair. </p><p>A pair of extraordinarily large and brilliant </p><p>eyes gazed at us. The entire impression I </p><p>gained was that of a super-normal intel- </p><p>lect. </p><p>Motioning with a withered and shrunken </p><p>hand for us to follow he turned to leave </p><p>the room. I stood irresolute until Novak </p><p>set the example. I seemed to look to him </p><p>instinctively for guidance. WTien he took </p><p>the initial step toward the aperture I fol- </p><p>lowed. </p><p>We walked down a low hall which was</p><p>barely wide enough for our passage, even </p><p>single file. The ceiling of this hall was even </p><p>lower than that in the room we had just </p><p>left. </p><p>Thus we walked until we came to an ob- </p><p>struction. Then our silent guide pulled, </p><p>a lever which operated a portcullis-like ar- </p><p>rangement. As it dropped behind us we </p><p>heard a sigh not unlike that caused by the </p><p>escape of highly compressed air. </p><p>Next we passed through a group of small </p><p>rooms, evidently used for passenger-cabins </p><p>and store rooms. Finally we emerged into </p><p>whal must have been the central room of the </p><p>vessel. </p><p>The room was large, in fact much larger </p><p>than you expect to find on a ship of any </p><p>kind. It was brilliantly lighted, also. The </p><p>light was the same blue as that in our room </p><p>but emanated from two tubular rods fixed </p><p>to the ceiling by metal clamps. The light </p><p>streamed down revealing in pitiless detail </p><p>every object in the room. </p><p>Thirty or more of the strange-looking </p><p>men were seated in a row of chairs arrang- </p><p>ed horseshoe fashion. In the hollow of </p><p>the semi-circle were two vacant chairs. Tlie </p><p>old man who had acted as our guide motion- </p><p>ed us to be seated in them. </p><p>We sank down into deep cushions, side </p><p>by side, our elbows touching, and waited </p><p>for the next step in this strange drama. </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>The Council </p><p>GLANCING about I noticed with a shud- </p><p>der of apprehension that every couni </p><p>tenance in that room was the same! The </p><p>faces of our captors were so identical that </p><p>they might have been cast from the same </p><p>mold. </p><p>I had no time to speculate on that, though, </p><p>as one of the queer creatures advanced to- </p><p>ward Novak and myself and began adjust- </p><p>ing helmet-like arrangements on our heads. </p><p>These helmets were fitted with electrodes </p><p>and mouthpieces and were attached to a com- </p><p>plicated looking machine in the center of </p><p>the room by wires. One of our captors</p><p>stationed himself at this machine. </p><p>A distinct click sounded through the </p><p>room and then a metallic sounding voice </p><p>began to speak: </p><p>“I would advise you to sit still and listen </p><p>quietly. You are in no immediate danger.” </p><p>Then the voice continued: </p><p>822 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>“You are probably interested most in </p><p>where you are. This is a vessel from Daar, </p><p>the sunken city. It is the first ship sent </p><p>from the lower world to the surface of the </p><p>sea in search of Borite.” </p><p>Novak interrupted with a question to </p><p>which the voice replied: </p><p>“Borite is known lo your world as a chem- </p><p>ical element, in ours it is called a primary.” </p><p>Again Novak made a query to which the </p><p>reply was: </p><p>“The atomic weight of Borite is 55.84.” </p><p>“That is what we know as iron”, Novak </p><p>exclaimed. </p><p>I thought of the Marovia and its missing </p><p>metal lining. </p><p>“May I ask what you want with Borite?” </p><p>Novak continued. </p><p>“For use in a vibratory heat ray which </p><p>when properly handled is a powerful wea- </p><p>pon of warfare,” the voice replied. </p><p>We were to learn more about that ray </p><p>within a short time! </p><p>The voice continued and next launched </p><p>into a brief history of Daar, the city to </p><p>which we were being taken, and its inhab- </p><p>itants. </p><p>Later we learned that the method of com- </p><p>munication between our captors and our- </p><p>selves was an intricate arrangement for the </p><p>transfer of thoughts. They were not actual- </p><p>ly speaking to us at all. The apparatus </p><p>made it possible for any one in the room to </p><p>consciously send a thought to or receive </p><p>a thought from any one else in the room. </p><p>Unusual facts about Daar were related by </p><p>the “spokesman” during the remainder of </p><p>the council. We learned that the city had </p><p>once existed above sea level on a continent </p><p>not unlike those of the world from which </p><p>Novak and I came. </p><p>The race inhabiting Daar was the supreme </p><p>one of the continent. Then a series of earth- </p><p>quakes began crumbling the earth and as</p><p>the cataclysms increased in intensity it be- </p><p>came apparent that Daar was slowly sinking </p><p>into the sea. </p><p>Scientists of the city devoted their skill </p><p>to the problem of saving the race. To have </p><p>constructed, enough boats to save the popu- </p><p>lation would have required years whereas </p><p>the most optimistic calculations gave the </p><p>city but a few more weeks of existence. </p><p>A scheme of salvation was perfected by </p><p>Dobeer, one of the nation’s most learned </p><p>scientists. The result was the erection of </p><p>an anti-gravitational machine which nuuli- </p><p>fied the weight of the ocean. Thus as the </p><p>supposedly doomed city slowly sunk be- </p><p>neath the waves of the ocean it was encased </p><p>in walls of weightless water. </p><p>So Daar became a mighty city located on </p><p>dry land beneath the sea. Isolated from </p><p>communication with other worlds the Daar- </p><p>ians devoted themselves to the study of </p><p>science with amazing results. </p><p>Waste materials such as are discarded </p><p>in our world were utilized to the fullest pos- </p><p>sible extent. Synthetic food was but one </p><p>of the marvels of everyday life. Atomic </p><p>energy also was utilized in many ways to </p><p>aid in supporting life in the city. </p><p>Those were the salient facts imparted to </p><p>us during that queer “conversation” in the </p><p>council hall of our captors. It appeared </p><p>that the meeting had been called more for </p><p>the purpose of supplying us with informa- </p><p>tion than to obtain any information from </p><p>us. </p><p>After the meeting Metoor, one of the coun- </p><p>cillors, was assigned to us as a guide and </p><p>in succeeding days took us on inspection </p><p>trips to various parts of the submersible. </p><p>The engine room was the most unbeliev- </p><p>able feature of the ship to me. I had pic- </p><p>turned it to myself as being filled with mas- </p><p>sive machinery. My surprise was complete </p><p>therefore when I found that its most prom- </p><p>inent feature was a small circular table </p><p>which stood on three legs in the center ol </p><p>the room. </p><p>A large globe surmounted this table. This </p><p>globe was surrounded by smaller ones which</p><p>glowed alternately in weird fashion and </p><p>rising from the cluster of globes was a long, </p><p>slender tube. This tube emitted the high </p><p>pitched whine we had heard so often. The </p><p>display of colors and dynamic force given </p><p>off by this delicate apparatus caused the </p><p>room to resemble a scientific laboratory </p><p>more than the power room of a vessel. </p><p>“Surely that tube doesn’t furnish the </p><p>power which drives this ship,” I exclaimed. </p><p>DEATH FROM THE SEAS </p><p>823 </p><p>“But it does,” Metoor responded, “an </p><p>infinitesimal sliver of steel is in that tube. </p><p>When the atoms in the steel are broken up, </p><p>intra-atomic energy is produced which fur- </p><p>ishes the propelling power for the ship.” </p><p>UTJOW do you release that power?” </p><p>X A Novak asked. </p><p>Our guide explained: </p><p>“The steel is held in the middle of the </p><p>tube by two clamps. A current of electric- </p><p>ity of a high potential passes through it </p><p>projecting a stream of electrons from the </p><p>bottom of the tube to the vibratory ray </p><p>which bombards the electrons of the steel </p><p>atoms. The balance is thus disrupted and </p><p>the proton released. Stores of energy at- </p><p>taining titanic proportions are thus avail- </p><p>able.” </p><p>Another question of Novak’s was in re- </p><p>gard t© the method of controlling the verti- </p><p>cal and horizontal movements of the vessel. </p><p>Metoor replied: </p><p>“That is accomplished by means of a </p><p>weight reducing and increasing machine. </p><p>In other words an invention similar to the </p><p>anti-gravitational machnie you have heard </p><p>about. By increasing the weight of the ship </p><p>we are able to sink and also to withstand </p><p>the terrific pressure of the lower ocean </p><p>depths. </p><p>“By the opposite use of the machine we </p><p>can decrease weight. In fact we can lighten </p><p>the vessel until it actually weighs less than </p><p>the atmosphere. That is what we have to </p><p>do when we emerge from the water and en- </p><p>ter our own city.” </p><p>We passed through the other parts of the </p><p>ship in rapid succession. The living quar- </p><p>ters of the councillors were at the back of </p><p>the ship. There were storerooms there, al- </p><p>so, in which we saw piles of steel trimmings. </p><p>Looking at those mute reminders of the </p><p>terrible catastrophes on top of the sea I </p><p>•wondered what lay ahead of us in Daar. </p><p>Daar </p><p>HAVING no means for calculating time </p><p>I do not know how long our journey </p><p>Jn the submersible lasted. </p><p>One day Metoor summoned Novak and me </p><p>to the council chamber and pushing back aJ </p><p>panel in the wall said: </p><p>“Look!” </p><p>We were floating above a large city. </p><p>As we gazed in astonished awe Metoori </p><p>said: </p><p>“The city of Daar.” </p><p>Our craft landed in much the same man- </p><p>ner a huge dirigible is brought down. It. </p><p>was anchored on the flat roof of a largo </p><p>building with the manual labor being per- </p><p>formed by robots who were almost human </p><p>in appearance. The mechanism operating </p><p>them must have been almost perfect. </p><p>The scene was one of bustling activity. </p><p>Metoor remained by our sides until landing </p><p>operations were completed and then led </p><p>us from the machine. </p><p>“There will be a meeting of the council- </p><p>lors this afternoon which you will attend”, </p><p>he told us. </p><p>Until that time we were left more or less </p><p>to our own devices with one of the coun- </p><p>cillors acting as a guide, or, as we suspected, </p><p>as guard. </p><p>A superficial survey of Daar revealed that </p><p>it was laid out in accordance with the </p><p>radial plan of city building in the upper </p><p>world. The buildings were practically uni- </p><p>form in size and were arranged so that they </p><p>led toward a square or park which appeared </p><p>to be a public meeting place of some kind. </p><p>Architecturally the buildings tended to- </p><p>ward the massive and utilitarian style. Each </p><p>was surmounted by a tall, gray spire which </p><p>in turn supported a glittering globe. These </p><p>domes pointed toward the dim wall above, </p><p>which we knew to be the ocean wall. </p><p>In the center of the square or park, where</p><p>%the buildings terminated, there was a tall </p><p>fence surrounding a spire larger than any </p><p>in the city. This building housed the anti- </p><p>gravitational apparatus, we later learned. </p><p>Anti-gravitational emanations from that </p><p>tall spire held the ocean back and insured </p><p>the safety of the city. </p><p>Despite the oddities of the city Novak and </p><p>I were conccntrating more on thoughts of </p><p>the council meeting than on the strange </p><p>sights surrounding us. We felt that our; </p><p>fate probably depended on that meeting. At </p><p>the very least we hoped to discover some </p><p>824 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>clue as to the reason for oar capture and </p><p>transportation to Daar. </p><p>Impatiently, therefore, we waited for the </p><p>summons which came in due time calling </p><p>us to the meeting. In the council chamber </p><p>we found a large group of men awaiting us </p><p>who were identical in appearance lo those </p><p>we had seen on the submersible. </p><p>Metoor was the spokesman for the group </p><p>and after our headpieces had been adjusted </p><p>he plunged immediately into the subject. </p><p>“We are facing a grave national crisis,” </p><p>he began, “the Borite we have obtained is </p><p>insufficient for our purpose. We want you </p><p>to guide us to a spot on the surface of the </p><p>sea where we can be sure of obtaining </p><p>more.” </p><p>Novak spoke for us and in a series of dis- </p><p>creet questions discovered that the Daariana </p><p>were badly disappointed in the small amount </p><p>of iron obtained from the ship they had de- </p><p>stroyed. They had hoped to obtain much </p><p>greater quantities of the valuable substance. </p><p>Naturally we were not inclined to league </p><p>ourselves with these strange creatures </p><p>against our own people, so we disclaimed </p><p>any knowledge of where they might be sure </p><p>of obtaining greater quantities of steel. </p><p>The councillors were quite frank in out- </p><p>lining their needs to us. They seemed to </p><p>consider us harmless in hurting their en- </p><p>terprise. We discovered that a struggle for </p><p>supremacy was in process between two op- </p><p>posing factions in the sub-sea metropolis. </p><p>The group with whom we were perforce </p><p>allied were the hereditary rulers of Daar. </p><p>Although they numbered only 250 in a pop- </p><p>ulation of about 20,000 persons they had </p><p>held undisputed sway until a short time be- </p><p>fore. Their commands were enforced by </p><p>thousands of robots created by the council- </p><p>lors and capable of carrying out any instruc- </p><p>tions they were given. </p><p>We learned that celibacy was maintained </p><p>among the councillors and that their number </p><p>remained the same always. All of them </p><p>were bred from an artificially fertilized</p><p>female who was selected every 25 years </p><p>from among the masses. That explained </p><p>their standardization in face and form. </p><p>The general population, known as “the </p><p>masses,” had submitted to this dictatorship </p><p>until a short time before when threats of </p><p>an uprising began to spread. The masses, </p><p>it seemed, were tired of their life of servi- </p><p>tude and planned to overthrow the council- </p><p>lors, construct enough submersibles for the </p><p>purpose and escape to the upper world. </p><p>This much we learned before being dis- </p><p>missed from tlie council. Metoor then in- </p><p>formed us that guides would take us for a </p><p>more extended tour of the city than we had </p><p>yet enjoyed. We were told that we need </p><p>have no fear in visiting the various parts of </p><p>the city as the plans of the masses were as </p><p>yet secret and supposedly unknown to the </p><p>councillors. </p><p>Novak had characteristically decided that </p><p>he preferred to see the scientific laboratories </p><p>of Daar first while I wished to tour the </p><p>city generally. As we waited for our guides </p><p>we heard a sigh of compressed air that </p><p>signaled the opening of a door leading to </p><p>the elevator, or pneumatic-tube arrange- </p><p>ment which connected the different build- </p><p>ings in Daar. </p><p>We turned in rather uninterested fashion </p><p>and then it seemed for a moment that my </p><p>heart stopped beating. The next moment </p><p>it was racing, trip-hammer fashion. </p><p>IN the door, beside one of the men of </p><p>Daar, stood Marna! </p><p>She stood transfixed with surprise, too. </p><p>Her jet black hair cascaded down and </p><p>partially covered her white shoulders. Her </p><p>blue eyes, which had a tinge of violet in </p><p>them, were opened wide in astonishment </p><p>and her lips were parted. </p><p>The tight-fitting white garment she wore </p><p>accentuated the symmetrical lines of her </p><p>figure. Indeed to my startled eyes she look- </p><p>ed like the vision of a Greek statue come to </p><p>life. </p><p>Then after a brief moment of amazement</p><p>I stiffened and pretended not to know her. </p><p>Bu^ with our eyes we spoke volumes, and </p><p>only when the guide left us alone for a </p><p>moment did we embrace, and seated Marna </p><p>and I began a mutual explanation of what </p><p>we knew about our situation and how we </p><p>happened to be where we were. </p><p>Mama’s story was much like mine. The </p><p>Times boat on which she had been a passen- </p><p>DEATH FROM THE SEAS </p><p>825 </p><p>ger had been attacked in much the same </p><p>way Novak and I had been overcome on </p><p>the Marovia. </p><p>The fearful rays had flashed over the boat </p><p>spreading death and destruction. Marna </p><p>lost consciousness and when she revived </p><p>found herself among the strange crew on </p><p>the Daarian boat. Apparently she was the </p><p>only person on any of the attacked boats </p><p>whose life had been spared. Why this was </p><p>she did not know. But on the return trips </p><p>the Daarian boat made to the surface of the </p><p>sea no one else had been brought back ex- </p><p>cept Novak and myself. </p><p>The men on the submersible had treated </p><p>her with a respect and almost a homage </p><p>that had led Marna to believe her capture </p><p>was in accordance with some plan. But so </p><p>far she had been able to learn nothing about </p><p>tje reason for her preservation at a time </p><p>when all others were suffering a horrible </p><p>death. </p><p>Marna had been accorded full freedom </p><p>and whenever possible her slightest wish </p><p>in Daar had been granted. As there was </p><p>no possible chance for her escape she had </p><p>gone wherever she wished. Natural curi- </p><p>osity had prompted her to thoroughly ex- </p><p>plore the peculiarities of the city. As a re- </p><p>sult she was almost as familiar with the </p><p>city as the Daarians themselves. </p><p>In summoning her as one of her guides, </p><p>Metoor had played what he thought would </p><p>be a waggish trick by suddenly confronting </p><p>us with one of our own race. How little </p><p>he had guessed what that discovery meant </p><p>to me! </p><p>Needless to say Atoor, the Daarian ac- </p><p>companying Marna, summarily became </p><p>Novak’s guide to the laboratories while </p><p>Marna and 1 departed for a happy tour of </p><p>the remainder of the city. </p><p>We bade Novak and Atoor a temporary </p><p>good-bye as Marna led the way to a corner </p><p>of the room where she pressed a hidden but- </p><p>ton. A door flew open revealing a tiny </p><p>cushioned elevator. We entered and began </p><p>our pleasurable trip together. </p><p>Marna took delight then and later in </p><p>showing me her superior knowledge of the </p><p>ways of Daar and we had many hearty </p><p>laughs as she guided me about the city. </p><p>After entering the elevator Marna manipu- </p><p>lated a lever. A light glowed at the top </p><p>and I felt an almost sickening acceleration. </p><p>The elevator came to a easy halt within a </p><p>few minutes and stepping from it we found </p><p>ourselves on a balcony overlooking a broad </p><p>street. </p><p>The thoroughfare beneath us was paved </p><p>with a hard looking white stone, which was </p><p>similar to marble in appearance. Throngs </p><p>of people were jostling each other about </p><p>in the crowded street. I immediately notic- </p><p>ed the lack of any type of vehicular traffic. </p><p>Yet this was not such a strange situation </p><p>when you considered that the city at its </p><p>widest point was only six miles across. </p><p>Vehicles for transportation through the </p><p>streets would have constituted a public </p><p>nuisance due to the crowded condition of </p><p>the city. Thinking of our traffic tangles in </p><p>the upper world 1 could not help smiling </p><p>and giving the Daarians another of those </p><p>mental salutes I was getting in the habit of </p><p>bestowing on them as 1 became better ac- </p><p>quainted with their ideas. </p><p>We stood on the balcony a short time </p><p>surveying the scene and listening to the </p><p>snatches of inane conversation which float- </p><p>ed up to us. The masses conversed together </p><p>freely and only the councillors used the </p><p>method of thought transference in place of </p><p>using their voices. </p><p>In rapid succession we visited the places </p><p>of importance in Daar. Marna gave de- </p><p>scriptions of the points of interest and laugh- </p><p>ingly compared herself to the ballyhoo </p><p>spielers of the rubber neck wagons in the </p><p>big cities at home. </p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>The Crisis	;</p><p>THE presence of Mama in Daar acceler- </p><p>ated the half formed plans Novak and </p><p>1 had already made for our escape. </p><p>We attempted in frantic fashion to per- </p><p>fect a plan for eluding the councillors and </p><p>leaving Daar. The impending crisis in the</p><p>city served as a spur to our efforts. </p><p>But it seemed that we were caught in a </p><p>trap from which there was no chance of </p><p>escape. </p><p>826 </p><p>.WONDER STORIES </p><p>“Our only hope is to gain control of the </p><p>submersible some way,” I told Novak one </p><p>day. </p><p>“Easier said than done, I’m afraid,” he </p><p>responded, “how are you going to get by </p><p>the guard?” </p><p>“That’s what is worrying me,” I replied. </p><p>A guard of heavily armed robots was on </p><p>duty at all times. They were directed by a </p><p>councillor who was always on guard with </p><p>them. The councillors were afraid that the </p><p>opposing faction might seek to gain control </p><p>of the vessel. </p><p>An ominous calm seemed to be deepening </p><p>over the city during those anxious day. The </p><p>population went about its daily tasks as usu- </p><p>al in the factories and laboratories of Daar. </p><p>But revolution was brewing secretly and </p><p>the situation was becoming more acute </p><p>every day, we learned from Metoor. The </p><p>masses were merely biding their time waiting </p><p>for the word from Monas, their leader, be- </p><p>•fore striking. </p><p>The work of insulating the vibratory guns </p><p>with which the councillors planned to repel </p><p>an open attack was being hurried as rapidly </p><p>as possible. </p><p>Novak and I were permitted a great deal </p><p>of liberty and with Marna kept our eyes </p><p>and ears open as we wandered about Daar. </p><p>But in spite of our efforts we seemed no </p><p>nearer a solution of our problem. </p><p>Metoor continued his friendly interest in </p><p>us although we saw but little of him as he </p><p>hurried from one conference to another and </p><p>between times visited the factory where the </p><p>heat ray guns were being prepared. </p><p>The masses had been kept in ignorance </p><p>of the development of this ray and all the </p><p>manual labor of insulation was being done </p><p>by robots, who obeyed the mental impulses </p><p>of the councillors in charge of the factory. </p><p>One day I gathered courage to ask Metoor </p><p>a question: </p><p>“Metoor, why was Marna alone spared </p><p>of all those aboard the vessels you destroy- </p><p>ed in your search for Borite?” </p><p>He replied, almost carelessly: “We will </p><p>use her instead of a woman from the masses </p><p>when the time arrives next for replenishing </p><p>our councillors. In that way we will show </p><p>the masses how unimportant they are to </p><p>our welfare.” </p><p>Concealing my agitation I made some </p><p>noncommital reply and thanked whatever </p><p>instinct had warned me |o tell Marna not </p><p>to betray the fact that we were sweethearts. </p><p>If the councillors had guessed that we were </p><p>even acquainted in the upper world they </p><p>would probably have imprisoned Marna or </p><p>at least refused to let us spend so much time </p><p>together. </p><p>Day by day the atmosphere seemed to </p><p>grow more strained in Daar. </p><p>“Bob. I believe we could gain control </p><p>of the submersible if we could get rid of </p><p>the councillor who directs the guard,” </p><p>Novak said one day. </p><p>“That’s right,” I exclaimed as the full </p><p>force of the idea struck me, “without the </p><p>councillor the robots are helpless. They </p><p>depend entirely on the mental directions </p><p>given them.” </p><p>“What’s that?” Novak asked sharply as a </p><p>shrill siren began sounding through the </p><p>city. </p><p>Marna answered: </p><p>“That is a signal for the people to gather </p><p>at the council hall.” </p><p>Curious to discover the cause of the alarm </p><p>we joined the throngs of Daarians who were </p><p>hastening to the park-like enclosure about </p><p>the council hall. </p><p>“By George, Monas has called this meet- </p><p>ing, not the councillors,” I exclaimed as we </p><p>neared our destination. </p><p>It was the determined looking leader of </p><p>the masses who stood on a balcony prepar- </p><p>ing to address the crowd. </p><p>“My people,” he began in a thundering </p><p>voice, “I have called you together to tell </p><p>you of the villainous plans of the council- </p><p>lors:” </p><p>An angry murmur rose from the crowd. </p><p>“We have just discovered their plans for </p><p>exterminating the masses of Daar with a </p><p>powerful heat ray gun. They plan to use </p><p>the gun against us unless we continue to </p><p>obey them,” Monas continued. “Our only </p><p>means of protection is to seize the factory </p><p>where these guns are being made!” </p><p>The roar of the crowd was almost deafen* </p><p>DEATH FROM THE SEAS </p><p>827 </p><p>ing as the Daarians signified their assent to </p><p>the plan. </p><p>Then suddenly another voice was heard </p><p>booming out above the noise of the crowd. </p><p>METOOR stood on an opposite balcony. </p><p>“I warn you, people of Daar, that an </p><p>attempt against the councillors will seal </p><p>your doom,” he shouted, “it is impossible </p><p>for you to withstand the heat ray gun or </p><p>seize the factory.” </p><p>In a tremendous shout the people re </p><p>sponded: </p><p>“Down with the councillors!” </p><p>Then the multitude took up the cry: “To </p><p>the factory! To the factory!” </p><p>Suddenly Novak clutched my arm and </p><p>hissed: “Look!” </p><p>A well aimed flame of blue was shooting </p><p>through the air. It was directed from a </p><p>window in the council hall. The brilliant </p><p>scintillation speedily proved itself to be a </p><p>deadly weapon and the hoarse clamor of </p><p>the mob changed to shrieks of pain and </p><p>fear. </p><p>As the terrible ray flashed through the </p><p>crowd the odor of burning flesh rose to our </p><p>nostrils in a horrible stench and charred </p><p>corpses began to fall among the crowd. </p><p>Then as the ray was momentarily with- </p><p>drawn, Monas again leaped to the balcony </p><p>and cried in a loud voice. </p><p>“Oh Councillors, if we die you will per- </p><p>ish also. For your own good listen to me.” </p><p>Metoor from his place motioned Monas </p><p>to proceed. </p><p>“We are not without a defense,” Monas </p><p>cried. “Even now our men have seized the </p><p>anti-gravitational tower. If you turn the </p><p>heat ray gun on us again we will plunge </p><p>the whole city to destruction.” </p><p>Excitedly I whispered to Novak: </p><p>“This is our chance. It is now or never.”</p><p>He nodded and we began pushing a way </p><p>through tlie crowd for Marna working to- </p><p>ward the flat topped building where the </p><p>submersible was moored. </p><p>Then the very earth beneath us seemed to </p><p>tremble. We hesitated and then heard a </p><p>new shout of fear go up. </p><p>In the lull we heard Monas’ frantic </p><p>voice: </p><p>“Fly for your lives, the men at the tower </p><p>have mistaken the signal and are loosing </p><p>the waters upon Daar!” </p><p>With that terrible cry ringing in our ears </p><p>we sped on. Icy blasts of air were sweep- </p><p>ing about us and as we neared the machine </p><p>drops of water like huge splashes of rain </p><p>began lo fall on us. </p><p>“Hurry,” I panted. </p><p>Luck was with us for as we rounded the </p><p>last corner we saw that only one councillor </p><p>was on guard with the robots. </p><p>Slackening our pace Novak and I crept </p><p>forward stealthily and then leaped. The </p><p>councillor was taken unaware and strug- </p><p>gled fiercely but we fought with the fury </p><p>of desperation and soon felt his figure </p><p>go limp in our grasp. The robots halted </p><p>stupidly in their tracks unaware of what </p><p>was taking place. </p><p>Then we heard the crashing of masonry </p><p>and turning saw one of the largest build- </p><p>ing in Daar sway and then fall in an up- </p><p>roar of falling brick and stone, </p><p>i Next we heard a mighty whistling sound, </p><p>not unlike that of a tornado magnified many </p><p>times. </p><p>“The light in the tower is out,” Novak </p><p>screamed into my ear. 1 gave one fleeting </p><p>glimpse and saw that the fiery ball in the </p><p>anti-gravitational tower was dark. </p><p>Then I gathered Marna into iny arms for </p><p>the final dash to the door of the submersible. </p><p>As we gained the security of the machine we </p><p>heard the titanic roar of the falling ocean. </p><p>Novak swung a switch, the crafl gave a </p><p>terrifying wrench and then we could feel it</p><p>shoot rapidly upward through the only free </p><p>exit. We were leaving the doomed city! </p><p>THE END. </p><p>The Gland Men of the </p><p>T ^ T ^ ^4	Malcolm R* Afford</p><p>How long they sat there contemplating our movements will never be </p><p>known, for as I sighted them they became galvanized into life </p><p>828 ' </p><p>An Army of Merciless, Inhuman Creatures were ready </p><p>♦ ♦ * Under the Master's hand they armed for, </p><p>action ♦ ♦ ♦ then Nature entered the play ♦ ♦ * </p><p>TO many who read my account of our </p><p>amazing adventure on the island of the </p><p>Gland Men, it will serve as just another il- </p><p>lustration of how devious is the path of </p><p>science.

Follansbee, as I knew him </p><p>in my days as laboratory assistant to the </p><p>doctor—one of those singularly fortunate </p><p>individuals who know exactly what they </p><p>want and how to get it without offending </p><p>a single soul—inclined to be cynical, yet </p><p>straight as the proverbial string. He had </p><p>inherited from his father an insatiable de- </p><p>sire for adventure and an income that ran </p><p>into I forget how many figures. Being a </p><p>man of somewhat simple philosophy, he </p><p>used the latter to appease the former. </p><p>It had taken our combined arguments, </p><p>practised often and over long periods, to </p><p>make the doctor even consider such a thing </p><p>as recreation and I had experienced the </p><p>hardest task of my life in getting him from </p><p>his chambers in Gower Street, to which he </p><p>clung like Diogenes to his wooden cavern. </p><p>Even after his actual transplanting on to </p><p>his opulent friend's yacht, the Silver Lady,</p><p>he took his enforced holiday like a small </p><p>boy takes his medicine, but as the illimi- </p><p>table miles of sparkling water grew between </p><p>our vessel and his stuffy chambers, he turn- </p><p>ed about to enjoy himself. </p><p>We were midway between the Solomons </p><p>and Santa Cruz Islands when the queer af- </p><p>fair began. The morning had been oppres- </p><p>sively calm and Follansbee, the doctor and </p><p>myself had taken the electric launch to ex- </p><p>amine the rock fauna that flourished so pro- </p><p>lifically hereabouts. It was characteristic of </p><p>the doctor that he could, when required, </p><p>produce inexhaustible stores of unexpected </p><p>knowledge on the most out-of-the-way sub- </p><p>jects; and though I had never before heard </p><p>him mention marine growths, here he was </p><p>expounding in his most didactic manner to </p><p>his slightly amused companion. </p><p>Having little taste in such matters, I was </p><p>reclining upon the collapsible canvas chair, </p><p>smoking a cigarette, and occasionally dip- </p><p>ping my hand into the water, in order to </p><p>convince myself that it would not emerge </p><p>dyed blue. Whether, rocked by the gentle </p><p>motion of the boat, I fell into a semi-doze </p><p>or whether the change swept down so quiok- </p><p>ly that its coming was unnoticed, I cannot </p><p>say.

They are here </p><p>today and gone tomor- </p><p>• row, thrust up by some </p><p>volcanic eruption, </p><p>eked under the sea </p><p>by a tidal wave or </p><p>some similar under- </p><p>sea disturbance.” </p><p>“I sincerely hope </p><p>that it remains stable </p><p>during our occupa- </p><p>tion,” I remarked. </p><p>Then the launch </p><p>grounded on the shore </p><p>and I jumped out lo </p><p>aid Follansbee to beach </p><p>it high and dry. This </p><p>done, we took our first </p><p>close look at ihe is- </p><p>land, our enforced </p><p>landing place. </p><p>As we stood on the </p><p>clean fringe of sand, </p><p>the hush of the ele- </p><p>ments was even more </p><p>apparent. Not a leaf </p><p>moved in the thick hu- </p><p>mid heat, not a bird </p><p>flew or animal moved. </p><p>It seemed as though all </p><p>/ Nature was waiting </p><p>breathlessly for the op- </p><p>ening of the cataclysm. But for the low </p><p>rumble of the breakers, we might have trod </p><p>another planet, some long dead world; and </p><p>the thick sand, deadening our footsteps, gave </p><p>us a peculiar disembodied sensation that </p><p>was unpleasant in the extreme. It was Fol- </p><p>TH^ GLAND MEN OF THE ISLAND </p><p>831 </p><p>lansbee who broke the silence. “No good </p><p>cooling our heels on this beach,” he said. </p><p>“Under the circumstances, I think it would </p><p>he worth our while to do a little exploring. </p><p>That track through the trees seera9 to sug- </p><p>gest unlimited possibilities.” He broke off </p><p>and pointed to where a worn track wound </p><p>its way through the undergrowth. </p><p>“At least,” remarked the doctor, as we </p><p>made our way toward it, “we cannot claim </p><p>to be true Crusoes. Someone has used this </p><p>path pretty frequently—and not so long </p><p>ago, if we are to judge by its appearance.” </p><p>“Animals—?” I suggested. </p><p>“Much too narrow,” interjected Follans- </p><p>bee. “Then again, the beasts have no ob- </p><p>ject in coming here; </p><p>there is no water to drink, </p><p>nothing to eat and from </p><p>my experience of ani- </p><p>mals, they generally </p><p>shun the seabeach,” he </p><p>glanced at the dry rotted </p><p>grass. “No, my sonny, </p><p>that track was made by </p><p>one thing only—a num- </p><p>ber of men walking in </p><p>single file.” </p><p>1 looked blankly at the </p><p>waste of matted under- </p><p>growth and stunted trees, </p><p>“But where on earth did </p><p>they go?” I asked. </p><p>“That,” was the reply, </p><p>“is what we are going to </p><p>find out.” </p><p>In single file we followed the circuitous </p><p>path for over a mile, Follansbee leading, his </p><p>grey eyes gleaming, the doctor next and I </p><p>bringing up the rear. Through virgin </p><p>greenery that walled us on either side, so </p><p>thick that one seemed lo be treading some </p><p>matted corridor we went on; beneath wild </p><p>and tangled growth through which the sick- </p><p>ly light scarcely penetrated, over young lush </p><p>leafage that overlay and half disguised the </p><p>dank rottenness of the older vegetation,</p><p>through which loathsome creeping things </p><p>scuttled as we approached, things hideous </p><p>and detestable to look upon. </p><p>The last portion of our journey was ter- </p><p>rible. Here a fair-sized stream had become </p><p>bogged by matted reeds and the spread of </p><p>water was rapidly turning the surrounding </p><p>country into a poisonous swamp. Clouda </p><p>of insects hung over the black evil-smelling </p><p>pools, some huge as wasps, with bodies of </p><p>every conceivable hue and blend, some whose </p><p>sting was death, others bred in the fever </p><p>areas, carrying with them their dread leg- </p><p>acy. The sibilant hum was discernable </p><p>quite a distance away, and it sounded eerily </p><p>out of place in that region of silence and </p><p>decay. </p><p>Suddenly, with the abruptness that was </p><p>almost startling, the forest ended and we </p><p>saw ahead of us a flat plain. We were just </p><p>about to step out 011 to the wide clearing, </p><p>when Follansbee, who </p><p>was leading, uttered a </p><p>cry of amazement, stif- </p><p>fened and stood stock </p><p>still. He was staring at </p><p>some scene below him on </p><p>the plain, and as we ap- </p><p>proached, he turned and </p><p>finger on lip, pointed. </p><p>Stepping quietly, we </p><p>drew alongside him and </p><p>I choked down the gasp </p><p>that rose in my throat. </p><p>We were looking on a </p><p>wide barren area of land, </p><p>in the centre of which </p><p>was a cluster of iron </p><p>buildings. That they </p><p>were tenanted was ob- </p><p>vious by the thin trail of </p><p>smoke that curled its way from the chim- </p><p>neys. One edifice, slightly isolated from the </p><p>rest, was surrounded by a high wooden </p><p>stockade, pierced at intervals by loopholes. </p><p>The Creatures of the Island </p><p>AS we watched, thunderstruck by our dis- </p><p>covery, from one side of the stockade </p><p>came a troupe of figures. There seemed no </p><p>doubt that they were men, but such men as </p><p>I have never before set eyes upon. They </p><p>were of enormous stature, most of them be-</p><p>ing over eight feet in height. They moved </p><p>with a peculiar lumbering gait, that was </p><p>vaguely suggestive of something that I could </p><p>MALCOLM R. AFFORD </p><p>832 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>not place. Their arms, swinging at their </p><p>sides seemed absurdly out of proportion lo </p><p>their bodies, and the great hands clasped </p><p>tightly upon an object that, at the distance </p><p>looked like an axe. </p><p>Each wore a kind of khaki shirt and </p><p>breeches, with leather leggings that reached </p><p>from instep lo knee. A sun helmet took </p><p>the place of a hat and as one turned away </p><p>from us, I noticed a peculiar irregular </p><p>blotch upon the back of the shirt. At first, </p><p>I took this to be some personal damage, but </p><p>a further glance showed me that each wore </p><p>a similar adornment. At the distance, how- </p><p>ever, it was impossible to distinguish ihe </p><p>outline. </p><p>“By Gad,” exclaimed Follansbee, as he </p><p>unslung his glasses. “We seem to have </p><p>stumbled on a modern Brobdingnag. Thank </p><p>Heaven for that storm.” </p><p>The Doctor was already examining the </p><p>monsters, so after a scrutiny, the explorer </p><p>passed his glasses to me. I adjusted the </p><p>powerful lens lo my sight, and the ap- </p><p>proaching creatures leapt into my field of </p><p>vision. </p><p>If, at a distance, these creatures looked </p><p>unprepossessing, they seemed doubly so at </p><p>close quarters. The lens picked out every </p><p>detail with horrifying clearness, the broad, </p><p>hunched shoulders, the long muscular arms, </p><p>covered with coarse black hair, the slouch- </p><p>ing movement, caused, 1 now perceived, by </p><p>the ridiculously short bandy legs. As one </p><p>stopped to converse with his neighbour, he </p><p>turned and the ragged blotch on his shirt </p><p>took definite shape. I started again, think- </p><p>ing that my eyes were playing me tricks. </p><p>The shape was that of a five-clawed drag- </p><p>on, reared in the act of striking. Il was </p><p>either stamped or sewn on in black cloth. </p><p>But il was the features that drew the eye </p><p>and held it in sheer horror, so hideously </p><p>repulsive were they. The tiny head, with </p><p>its wide slobbering mouth, the wicked red </p><p>eyes and the flat coarse nostrils inspired </p><p>one with a thrill of disgust and loathing. </p><p>The low receding forehead and the forward </p><p>position of the ears showed that, were they</p><p>humans, they were of a very low scale of </p><p>civilization. </p><p>“My God!” I heard Clovelly gasp. “Are </p><p>they man or beast?” </p><p>I opened my mouth to answer, when from </p><p>behind there came a rustle of disturbed un- </p><p>dergrowth. I swung around, but there was </p><p>nothing to account for the sound, when, act- </p><p>ing on some unknown impulse, I glanced </p><p>up into the tangle of,branches above. A </p><p>cry of horror burst from my lips, for there </p><p>above us, silent and motionless as the sur- </p><p>rounding forest, crouched four of those </p><p>hideous creatures thal we had been watch- </p><p>ing. How long they had sat there, their </p><p>blood-shot eyes contemplating our move- </p><p>ments, will never be known, for as I sight- </p><p>ed them, they became galvanized into life. </p><p>With guttural screams they sprang upon us, </p><p>and I was just about to run for my life, </p><p>when one gathered me beneath his arm like </p><p>a bundle of hay, and, with a curious wab- </p><p>bling stride, made for the walled-in build- </p><p>ing. </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>A Place of Terror </p><p>IN an incredibly short space of time, we </p><p>had reached the high partition. Here </p><p>the creatures paused and shouting some- </p><p>thing in the guttural tongue, pointed to the </p><p>gate, then to his companions in the rear. </p><p>In my awkward position, I was unable to </p><p>glimpse the one to whom he spoke, but it </p><p>was obviously the guardian of the portal, </p><p>for even as I screwed my neck to breaking </p><p>point, the obstacle swung back , and we </p><p>passed through. </p><p>I judged, by the stamp of the feet be- </p><p>hind, thal my colleagues were likewise cap- </p><p>tives, and by the sounds of struggle, that </p><p>they were not submitting so tamely as I. </p><p>Perhaps I was unfortunate in possessing a </p><p>particularly irascible gaoler, for my puny </p><p>efforts at escape had resulted in nothing </p><p>more than a cuff across the face that near- </p><p>ly took my head off. Maybe it was just a </p><p>gentle reminder that he would stand for no </p><p>nonsense, but it served to quiet me beyond </p><p>further resistance. </p><p>We traversed a slight dip and breasting </p><p>the slope, came to the main residence. Il </p><p>THE GLAND MEN OF THE ISLAND </p><p>833 </p><p>was much more pretentious than the out- </p><p>buildings, with neatly laid paths and flow- </p><p>erbeds. though the blooms could not be </p><p>called healthy. Across the roof were loop- </p><p>ed slender wires, standing clear against the </p><p>coppery sky, terminating in twin aerial </p><p>poles. It strengthened my conviction that </p><p>we had reached the headquarters of this </p><p>amazing island. </p><p>Four wooden steps led us into a wide hall </p><p>way, carpeted with rush mats, that strewed </p><p>the floor at regular intervals. A number </p><p>of doors, dimly discernible in the uncertain </p><p>light, opened off this passage, whose extre- </p><p>mity was lost in the prevailing gloom. </p><p>It was here that my guard at last set me </p><p>down and turning, signed to his companions </p><p>to do likewise. I smoothed my rumpled ap- </p><p>parel into something approaching order and </p><p>turning, beheld Follansbee, as imperturbable </p><p>as ever, in the act of lighting a cigarette. </p><p>Clovelly, seemed still stunned with amaze- </p><p>ment and he looked at me with eyes that </p><p>hinted a thousand questions. </p><p>Before he had time to utter a word, one </p><p>of the creatures wheeled around and disap- </p><p>peared into one of the rooms. As he op- </p><p>ened the door, I became aware of a peculiar </p><p>odor—sweet, sickly—that emanated from </p><p>behind it. For just a second it eluded me, </p><p>then as it grew stronger, I recognized it im- </p><p>mediately—chloroform. </p><p>I glanced at Clovelly, and smiled wryly. </p><p>He was sniffing the air like a thoroughbred, </p><p>his professional instincts aroused. I no- </p><p>ticed the slender white fingers quiver like </p><p>the antennae of some giant insect, itching </p><p>for the scalpel or the forceps. </p><p>Seeing ray interest, he opened his mouth </p><p>to speak, but what he meant lo say will nev- </p><p>er be known. Suddenly, tearing jaggedly </p><p>across the stillness, there came a horrifying </p><p>shriek of some poor soul in mortal agony. </p><p>Higher and higher it rose, in shrill cadence, </p><p>then at the highest note it ceased abruptly, </p><p>to die away in a gurgling mumble, then si- </p><p>lence—thick—enveloping—sinister— </p><p>1 am not easily frightened, but an icy hor- </p><p>ror gripped my heart. Clovelly was white</p><p>to the lips and even Follansbee was shaken </p><p>out of his customary equanimity. Our huge </p><p>guardians seemed absolutely unmoved by </p><p>the horird experience, not an emotion was </p><p>discernable upon their animal countenances, </p><p>they were as devoid of expression as a rub- </p><p>ber doll. </p><p>At that moment the door re-opened and </p><p>our guide appeared. Taking advantage of </p><p>the diversion, I crossed to the half open </p><p>door and essayed to peep inside. I was al- </p><p>most there when one of the creatures sprang </p><p>forward and with an angry grunt, grasped </p><p>my arm and with such force that I cried out. </p><p>Our huge guide turned quickly and looking </p><p>questioningly at his subordinate (as I took </p><p>the other to be) fired a volley of unintelli- </p><p>gible jargon at him. Suddenly the creature </p><p>released me as though I had become red- </p><p>hot and a look of something akin to de- </p><p>ference crossed the bestial face. But I hard- </p><p>ly noticed this, for my head was buzzing </p><p>with a new discovery. The opening and </p><p>shutting of the door had afforded me a mo- </p><p>mentary glimpse beyond—a fleeting vision </p><p>of a modern operating theatre, the tables, </p><p>instruments and assistants showing spotless- </p><p>ly clean in the bright artificial light. </p><p>One of the creatures crossed to a portion </p><p>of the wall opposite the door and pressing </p><p>on it, moved his hands in a curious circular </p><p>manner. </p><p>The reason for this was plainly obvious </p><p>the next moment, for there came the sound </p><p>of a metallic click and a section of the wall </p><p>swung back to reveal a door, set flush in the </p><p>woodwork. With more haste than cere- </p><p>mony, we were thrust through this door, it </p><p>clicked behind us—and for the first time </p><p>since our capture, we were left alone. </p><p>BUT we had no desire to converse. We </p><p>were struck silent by the extraordinary </p><p>appearance of the singular apartment in </p><p>which we found ourselves. I can close my </p><p>eyes now, and recall every feature of that </p><p>bizarre apartment as though it were yester- </p><p>day, so indelibly are the details engraven </p><p>on my mind. </p><p>It was circular in shape and lined with </p><p>books from floor to ceiling, the reds and </p><p>golds of the bindings reflecting the light </p><p>from the mosaic shaded lamp that hung in</p><p>the center of the room. Beneath this was a </p><p>huge bowl of roses, the colours shading </p><p>834 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>from one extreme to the other. Some there </p><p>■were so dark as to appear almost black, to </p><p>vivid scarlet and flaming yellow, to others so </p><p>delicately tinted as to truly rival the shy </p><p>blush of the maiden. They filled the room </p><p>with a heavy, exotic perfume and as I gazed, </p><p>one of the flowers, fullblown in that super- </p><p>heated atmosphere, burst slowly and the </p><p>creamy petals drifted slowly—one by one— </p><p>lightly as thistledown—onto the rich red </p><p>carpet on the floor. </p><p>Behind this great bouquet was a square </p><p>block of perfectly grained black marble, </p><p>flanked on either side by fantastically </p><p>wrought incense burners. Poised on the </p><p>marble base was a five-clawed dragon, in </p><p>the act of striking, carved from solid ivory </p><p>with the meticulous care that characterizes </p><p>the oriental artist. So cleverly was it </p><p>wrought that the object seemed to possess a </p><p>personality that was both fascinating, yet </p><p>repellent. It was wickedly beautiful in its </p><p>own way, and it recalled to me similar emo- </p><p>tions when I had first handled a Renais- </p><p>sance stiletto. </p><p>Directly opposite the carving, the books </p><p>ended abruptly, to recommence at an inter- </p><p>val of about three feet wide. Across the </p><p>aperture was hung a heavy plush curtain, </p><p>crimson with golden edging, and worked </p><p>with poppies and roses. It fell in heavy </p><p>folds that hung motionless in the still air, </p><p>exuding an influence of the obscene and the </p><p>unmentionable. </p><p>I turned and something caused me to rub </p><p>my eyes. Of the door we had entered, there </p><p>was no sign. Save for the curtained aper- </p><p>ture, the book-lined walls continued in an </p><p>unbroken line around the room. Hardly </p><p>able to believe the evidence of my own eyes, </p><p>I walked up and ran my fingers over them. </p><p>My hand encountered bindings—red—gold </p><p>—that winked mockingly in the vari-colour- </p><p>ed radiance. </p><p>The choice of books in themselves was </p><p>remarkable. The titles covered a wide </p><p>range from the transcendental and meta- </p><p>physical and all manner of works on the </p><p>processes and oddities of the human thought </p><p>seemed to be assembled there. They ranged </p><p>from the days of black magic to psycho-</p><p>therapeutics of the modern analytical school. </p><p>There were volumes by Zaasman and Jung, </p><p>together with other foreign scientists on </p><p>the morbid phenomena of the brain. </p><p>Interested in spite of myself, I took down </p><p>one book in German, a tongue with which I </p><p>am fairly conversant, but after a hurried </p><p>glance returned it hastily to its position. </p><p>It was a study of Dementia Praecox and </p><p>its plates of naked German lunatics almost </p><p>turned my stomach, quite unused as I was </p><p>to the German scientific treatment of the </p><p>more repellent disorders of life. </p><p>At the end of the highest row were a </p><p>number of volumes touching on the influ- </p><p>ence of suggestion on the human mind. </p><p>They ranged from the early investigations </p><p>of Bertrand and of James Braid to the more </p><p>recent studies of auto-suggestion by Coue and </p><p>other modern French writers in this line of </p><p>thought. </p><p>“By Jove, Follansbee,” the doctor’s softly </p><p>spoken remark brought me round like a </p><p>shot. “You wanted adventure, you craved </p><p>something different—well, you’ve got it, </p><p>with a vengeance.” </p><p>A Narrow Escape </p><p>THE big explorer shrugged his shoulders. </p><p>“There are.more things in Heaven and </p><p>Earth, my dear Horatio—he quoted. </p><p>“We seem to have stumbled fairly into the </p><p>latest six shilling sensationalism.’’ He </p><p>glanced at the watch on his wrist, “By the </p><p>Lord Harry, it’s almost ten o’clock. I </p><p>could tackle the proverbial leg of an iron </p><p>pot, I’m that peckish. I sincerely hope </p><p>someone puts in an appearance shortly,” he </p><p>broke off and glanced round the room. </p><p>“Who owns this musical comedy apartment, </p><p>anyway?” </p><p>The doctor paced the room, his hands </p><p>locked behind his back. “Do you know,” </p><p>he said, as he drew abreast of us, “I rather </p><p>fancy that we are on the eve of a momentous </p><p>discovery. Taking the curious events in </p><p>their sequence, we have the finding of the </p><p>Islands, the well-worn path through the </p><p>woods of an apparently uninhabited island </p><p>and our discovery of the giant creatures that </p><p>eventually captured us. Add to that the fact</p><p>that there is installed here something in the </p><p>THE GLAND MEN OF THE ISLAND </p><p>833. </p><p>form of ail operating theatre—so much is </p><p>plain by the use of chloroform—and we are </p><p>left to arrive at only one conclusion.” </p><p>“Why,” I broke in, “Behind that door </p><p>from whence the ether fuines emanated, is </p><p>an operating theatre, up-to-date and modern </p><p>in every respect. Though 1 caught just a </p><p>glimpse as the door opened, I recognized </p><p>the Newington naphtha flares, and they have </p><p>yet to be installed in the Prince’s Hospital. </p><p>Evidently, whoever uses the room insists on </p><p>every known appliance.” </p><p>Clovelly nodded absently. “Exactly. </p><p>It bears out my theory that before we leave </p><p>this island, we are going to learn that </p><p>science, in the hands of the unscrupulous, </p><p>can do quite so much harm as it can do </p><p>good.” He turned to me, “You, Huxley, </p><p>with your medical knowledge, can you not </p><p>glimpse at what is taking place here?” </p><p>I shook my head and coloured slightly. </p><p>“I can perceive nothing more than is appar- </p><p>ent to all of us. In some manner, the ruler </p><p>or owner of this island has possessed him- </p><p>self of some secret formula for the making </p><p>of super-men. This he does by some deli- </p><p>cate operation, for the elaborately equipped </p><p>operating room and the modern Blood Fil- </p><p>ter are both necessary in the course of the </p><p>metamorphosis.” </p><p>“And have you no idea of how this trans- </p><p>formation is effected?” </p><p>“Not the slightest, but I know enough </p><p>to be aware that he has a tremendous power </p><p>for good or ill. Just how he intends to use </p><p>it is a matter for conjecture.” </p><p>The doctor turned to Follansbee, but that </p><p>gentleman was gazing intently at the cur- </p><p>tained-off aperture. He closed his eyes </p><p>tight and shook his head. “Either I’m go- </p><p>ing clean blind batty or my eyes have de- </p><p>veloped the shakes, but I'm certain that I </p><p>saw that curtain move. I was just standing </p><p>here when—look, there now, do you see it?” </p><p>he broke off abruptly and pointed a finger </p><p>at the gentle moving cloth. </p><p>We stared as if fascinated at the slowly </p><p>writhing folds, as it twisted and coiled itself </p><p>into thick pleats, to belly out like a sail in</p><p>the sea breeze and then resolve into tiny </p><p>undulations that rippled across the crimson </p><p>surface. But the culmination came when </p><p>from behind it there arose a peculiar cough- </p><p>ing grunt, followed by a gasp of someone or </p><p>something struggling for breath. </p><p>“What fresh deviltry is this?” muttered </p><p>the explorer uneasily. He raised his voice. </p><p>“Anyone there?” he called. </p><p>There was no answer, but 1 for one was </p><p>hardly surprised. It was not enough for </p><p>Follansbee, though. He squared his broad </p><p>shoulders and clenched his fists. “I say,” </p><p>he called again, “is anyone there behind </p><p>that curtain?” </p><p>But the silence of the weird circular cham- </p><p>ber was unbroken. The curtains were mo- </p><p>tionless now. Another rose bloom, a flow- </p><p>er almost dead black, fell to pieces. Al- </p><p>most mechanically, I counted the falling </p><p>petals—one—two—three. </p><p>The big watcher paused just one second, </p><p>then with chin jutting ominously, he strode </p><p>toward the aperture. I could not but ad- </p><p>mire the stark courage of the man, facing </p><p>unarmed a danger, increased a thousand- </p><p>fold because of its indefinable quality. </p><p>Though my heart beat suspiciously fast, I </p><p>stepped up beside him and we were almost </p><p>to the curtain when an unlooked-for contin- </p><p>gency occurred. </p><p>“I would advise you, gentlemen, to leave </p><p>things that do not concern you, untouched. </p><p>The consequences of spying are sometimes </p><p>painful in the extreme.” </p><p>THE voice was suave and modulated, but </p><p>it possessed the quality of a revolver </p><p>shot, il could not have startled us more. </p><p>We whirled as if stung and gazed with wide </p><p>eyes at the author. </p><p>He was standing a little in rear of Dr. </p><p>Clovelly, and his manner of entry was a </p><p>matter for conjecture. Certainly none of us </p><p>had heard him, but as he was standing </p><p>where I presumed the secret entrance to </p><p>be situated, I judged that he had achieved </p><p>egress in like manner. </p><p>It needed only a second’s scrutiny to place </p><p>the man as an Oriental, hut he was clothed</p><p>in a neat fitting grey suit and shod with </p><p>smart, square-toed patent shoes. His skin </p><p>was smooth and butter-yellow and a pair of </p><p>large tortoise-shell glasses bridge his nose, </p><p>the huge pebbles making the eyes absurdly </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>out of proportion with the rest of the coun- </p><p>tenance. He wore his hair long and brush- </p><p>ed back off a high intellectual forehead. </p><p>He spoke with just a slightest trace of ac- </p><p>cent, a metallic emunciation of the consonant </p><p>“r”—a trait which characterises even the </p><p>most educated of Chinamen. </p><p>“I trust, gentlemen, that you will excuse </p><p>the somewhat rough handling. Strangers </p><p>are not welcome on the island of Ho Ming, </p><p>especially white strangers.” </p><p>As the insolent voice ceased, a thin ironi- </p><p>cal smile curved the thin lips, revealing two </p><p>rows of yellow teeth. But there was no </p><p>humour in the narrow-lidded, purple-black </p><p>eyes, for in their inky depths there lurked </p><p>the cruel passionless look of one who had </p><p>ga/ed too long on agony and suffering to </p><p>feel the sorrow and pity of it all. They re- </p><p>minded me of the loathsome orbs of a hood- </p><p>ed cobra. </p><p>Follansbee was first lo recover from his </p><p>surprise. “If we are nol asking too much,” </p><p>he asked quietly, “May I enquire just where </p><p>we are and whal relation you bear to all </p><p>this,” he waved his hand around ihe bizarre </p><p>apartment. </p><p>With all the slow dignity of his race, the </p><p>Chinaman raised his hand. “I will explain </p><p>in my own time,” he said blandly. “It is </p><p>I who give orders now and you will obey — -” </p><p>He smiled at the angry Follansbee—“No! </p><p>Then steps will be laken to make you obey. </p><p>We of Hankow have many methods of cur- </p><p>ing obstinancy.” </p><p>Dr. Clovelly started forward. “We are </p><p>British subjects,” he cried. “If you harm </p><p>us in any manner, the government will blow </p><p>your island to Glory and you will end your </p><p>career with a rope around your neck.” </p><p>The Chinaman bowed and spread his </p><p>hands. “If it eases you to entertain such </p><p>delusions, Dr. Clovelly, by all means do so. </p><p>Bui you have evidently forgotten the neces- </p><p>sity of communicating your unfortunate </p><p>position to your Government.” </p><p>“How do you know my name?” </p><p>“I know many things, for I am the chosen </p><p>ruler of the People of the Ming Dragon.</p><p>You have arrived at a most opportune mo- </p><p>ment—” the Oriental broke off abruptly— </p><p>“Gentleman, I have a proposition to put be- </p><p>fore you.” </p><p>He walked over to the black marble dais </p><p>and seated himself thereon. For a moment </p><p>he sat thus, seeming deep in thought, then </p><p>he raised his eyes and glanced at each of us </p><p>in turn. </p><p>“Now,” he began, “I want you to hold no </p><p>delusions as to your position on this island. </p><p>You are my prisoners, for me to do with </p><p>you as I whim. But you are all men who </p><p>have achieved some fame in your respective </p><p>professions and I have no desire to rob the </p><p>world of your talents. So—I offer this </p><p>truce.” </p><p>He turned in his seat and directed a long </p><p>slender finger at the doctor. “I know you, </p><p>Clovelly, as one of the greatest of living </p><p>authorities on the gland-grafting treatment. </p><p>Your studies with Steinach in Vienna, when </p><p>you unearthed the Cod Bone method proved </p><p>to me that you had the business of glanding </p><p>and rejuvenation at your fingertips. Mr. </p><p>James Huxley, your assistant, needs no in- </p><p>troduction to me, nor does your friend, Mr. </p><p>Follansbee. </p><p>“You have, no doubt, been rightfully be- </p><p>wildered over the strange creatures that in- </p><p>habit this place, hesitating to categorise </p><p>them as either man or beast. Let me set </p><p>your mind at rest, and inform you that they </p><p>are neither and yet both. That is lo say, </p><p>they possess ihe characteristics both animal </p><p>and human, because they are of a scale of </p><p>civilization that is intermediate. They eat, </p><p>walk, talk and work, possess the strength </p><p>of ten men, live to an almost prodigious age, </p><p>and lastly, possess a certain immunity from </p><p>sickness and disease. They are my Gland </p><p>Men and are the latest triumph of modern </p><p>science.” </p><p>The monotonous tones ceased and the </p><p>speaker, taking from his pocket an inlaid </p><p>case, extracted a cigarette. I blinked my </p><p>eyes and breathed hard, thoroughly con- </p><p>vinced that I was mad or dreaming. The </p><p>coloured shade slained the floor with its </p><p>dancing hues, the rose-scented air seemed </p><p>charged with the dominant personality of </p><p>the owner. The scratch of a match recalled</p><p>me and I saw the smoke curl through the </p><p>nostrils of the Oriental, as he lay back and </p><p>THE GLAND MEN OF THE ISLAND </p><p>837 </p><p>surveyed us with his narrow oblique eyes </p><p>lowered to mere slits. </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>A Gigantic Scheme </p><p>UTVTOW, gentlemen, behind this is a story </p><p>i. i of patience and attention to detail </p><p>that can only be achieved by one in search </p><p>of an ideal. Up on the slopes of the White </p><p>Headed Mountain, on the Western border of </p><p>Tibet, there stands a Lamasery known as the </p><p>‘Brothers of the Golden Khan’. It is the </p><p>holy of holies, this desolate edifice, for in </p><p>its sacred precincts there dwells the Most </p><p>Illustrious Deity, the Grand Lama Dalai. </p><p>He is a beautiful youth, with skin as soft </p><p>as a maiden and limbs muscular and sym- </p><p>metrical. Though he has attained the dis- </p><p>tinguished age of two hunched years, he has </p><p>the appearance of an unsullied youth, a fit </p><p>spectacle for the thousands of devout China- </p><p>men who yearly visited the shrine, leaving </p><p>it richer by gifts and money. </p><p>“Now, my father entered that Lamasery </p><p>as a youth, not because of any religious </p><p>urgings, but because he regarded the per- </p><p>manent youth of their Deity to be nothing </p><p>more than a gigantic hoax to attract money </p><p>and notoriety to their shrine. He knew </p><p>that the priests must possess some miracu- </p><p>lous secret of preserving eternal youth and </p><p>he meant to obtain that formula, cost what </p><p>it may. That the task was no sinecure was </p><p>obvious, but he had the patience and per- </p><p>severance that only one of the East can in- </p><p>herit. </p><p>“For forty long years, my father lived </p><p>with the priests, and he was just on the </p><p>point of achieving his life’s desire, when </p><p>he was betrayed by a treacherous servant. </p><p>He was caught and after a year of endless </p><p>torture eventually made his escape. He fled </p><p>to Hankow, where I was studying surgery </p><p>and delivered into my hands the sacred </p><p>tomes containing the great secret formu- </p><p>la. Further information I could not re- </p><p>ceive, for amongst other things, the Lama </p><p>priests had torn my father’s tongue from his </p><p>mouth, thus making him dumb forever. </p><p>“Then followed a reign of terror for us.</p><p>My father and I flew from place to plaoe, </p><p>but nowhere could we escape the watchful </p><p>eye of the vengeful priests, who, by that </p><p>lime, had discovered the missing volumes. </p><p>At length, 1 evolved a plan by which we </p><p>would be free from further persecution. </p><p>I personally sought an interview with the </p><p>Great Emperor Dragon, the great Shera </p><p>Sing, and laid my plans before him. He </p><p>was delighted with the idea, and not only </p><p>gave orders that I should be protected, but </p><p>also agreed to finance the scheme in view. </p><p>“One of the chapters in the book dealt </p><p>extensively with that branch of anatomy </p><p>known as the Endocrine Glands. As you </p><p>gentlemen are aware, this is but a newly </p><p>discovered phase of surgery, but to the Holy </p><p>Brothers, it had been old knowledge. There </p><p>is nothing in this earth so strange and fan- </p><p>tastic as the history of those obscure bod- </p><p>ily organs that mean more than life to us. </p><p>“Amongst other things, the two most fre- </p><p>quently mentioned were the thyroid, that </p><p>shield-like gland astride our Adam’s apple </p><p>and the pituitary, hanging from the base of </p><p>our brain by a hollow stem. The pituitary </p><p>controls our growth, but the thyroid con- </p><p>trols everything that makes our life worth </p><p>while. </p><p>“Children with deficient thyroids—from </p><p>atrophy, removal or injury—become things </p><p>horrible to look upon, giibbering idiotic </p><p>dwarfs—heavy featured and twisted yi body. </p><p>Cretins they are called, for they never met- </p><p>amorphose into normal adults. Hence the </p><p>importance of the obscure organ. </p><p>“But the Brethren experimented on </p><p>aquatic larvae. They caught a tadpole and </p><p>removed its thyroid. It never became a </p><p>frog, but remained a tadpole for the re- </p><p>mainder of its existence. On the other </p><p>hand, they gorged a tadpole with thyroxin, </p><p>and almost immediately it changed to a </p><p>frog. I say changed, gentlemen, not grew— </p><p>because the tadpole did not grow. The </p><p>frog, fully developed, remained only aa </p><p>large as a tadpole. Thyroxin feeding pro- </p><p>duces two results, it hastens metamorphos- </p><p>is, but retards growth. </p><p>“With this information, my father and </p><p>myself started out upon our momentous </p><p>schemc. We obtained the thyroid from an</p><p>838 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>ape and transferred it to that of a three- </p><p>months-old baby. Almost immediately the </p><p>child began to exhibit simian characteris- </p><p>tics—then the body began to alter shape. </p><p>But the child grew no larger than the day </p><p>the gland was transferred and it was to ov- </p><p>ercome this difficulty that we set ourselves. </p><p>“Now the growth, or pituitary gland is </p><p>not a vital organ, but a normal gland is </p><p>essential to normal life. An operation on </p><p>the pituitary is enormously difficult—for </p><p>one thing, it is only as big as the tip of the </p><p>little finger and it is so near the centre of </p><p>the head that it is next to impossible to </p><p>localize. But we finally overcame this </p><p>difficulty and all was ready for the final </p><p>experiment. </p><p>4 I &gt;1 IS was the scheme in mind. If a </p><p>JL grafted thyroid could transform a </p><p>child to an ape, would it not be possible to </p><p>transplant the glands of an anthropoid to </p><p>that of a growing human? An operation on </p><p>the pituitary would overcome the difference </p><p>in growth and the finished product would </p><p>possess the strength and power of an anth- </p><p>ropoid and the intelligence and appearance </p><p>of a human being. </p><p>“Such was the scheme that occurred to </p><p>me. Luckily I was possessed of twelve sis- </p><p>ters, and each, in turn gave their lives for </p><p>science. Still we were unsuccessful, the </p><p>creatures of our experiments being things </p><p>hideous and fearful to look upon, that were </p><p>killed as soon as tested. Then our faithful </p><p>servants professed themselves willing to </p><p>give their lives. Three there were and by a </p><p>strange freak of Fate, it was the last at- </p><p>tempt that was successful. Wc achieved a </p><p>huge beast, such as you see here today, and </p><p>it was this creature that we took to the Em- </p><p>peror as proof of our good faith. Then we </p><p>outlined to him our momentous scheme. </p><p>“What a great thing it would be for our </p><p>decadent empire could we but manufacture </p><p>an army of these Gland Men. They would </p><p>be immune from hurts and outlive the </p><p>strongest of soldiers. Again, they would </p><p>seek for nothing in return, fighting but to </p><p>appease their brutal instincts. With an </p><p>army such as these, we could wipe the en- </p><p>tire White Race from the world and restore</p><p>China to her rightful position as Mistress </p><p>of the World. The magnificence of the </p><p>scheme fairly dazzled me, such prodigious </p><p>possibilities did it possess. </p><p>“Here you see the great scheme in em- </p><p>bryo. Thanks to the magnificent genero- </p><p>sity of the Emperor, we have unlimited fac- </p><p>ilities for the great scheme in progress.” </p><p>Once more he paused, and the hard black </p><p>eyes, alight with the fire of fanaticism, </p><p>gleamed and sparkled like wet anthracite </p><p>coal. He leaned forward and waved a thin </p><p>yellow hand in our direction. </p><p>“White men,” he said, “Here is an un- </p><p>doubted truth. In a decade this colony will </p><p>be a serious menace to your white civiliza- </p><p>tion—and in fifty years we will sweep you </p><p>off the earth. China will return to her </p><p>rightful position, and the world will bow </p><p>down to the despised Chinaman.” </p><p>“Really,” Follansbee’s coolness was sup- </p><p>erb, “And if we whites are considered such </p><p>a nonentity, why expound to such a length </p><p>to us?” </p><p>The light died out of the Oriental's </p><p>countenance and the eyes narrowed percep- </p><p>tibly. He inhaled deeply on his cigarette </p><p>and as the smoke curled through the flat </p><p>nostrils, the pungent odour hung in wisps </p><p>on the heavily scented air. </p><p>“My Gland Men,” he murmured, so softly </p><p>that the purring voice was scarcely heard, </p><p>“lack but two things. One—the method of </p><p>human speech, and the other—of paramount </p><p>importance—is their sexlessness. It is upon </p><p>you gentlemen that I rely for the rectifica- </p><p>tion of those surgical errors.” </p><p>Dr. Clovelly took a step forward. “And </p><p>if we refuse?” </p><p>The Oriental shrugged his shoulders. </p><p>“1 have just attended to two operations this </p><p>morning,” he replied meaningly, “and in </p><p>the advent of your refusal, 1 will attend </p><p>three more tomorrow morning.” </p><p>“Do you mean that you operate here?” </p><p>“Certainly. Why not? We have every </p><p>facility of modern science, and a laboratory </p><p>that is the last word in the up-to-date.” </p><p>“But—but—” babbled Dr. Clovelly,</p><p>amazedly, “Your supplies—and chemicals.” </p><p>Ho Ming gave an upward gesture of his </p><p>hands. “Wireless,” he explained. “A call </p><p>THE GLAND MEN OF THE ISLAND </p><p>839 </p><p>to our base will bring a ship load of sup- </p><p>plies within a few days. That is what has </p><p>cut that path through the undergrowth.” </p><p>“But your—er—patients do not recover </p><p>immediately. You must have a hospital, or </p><p>something of the kind?” </p><p>“If you consent to my proposition, Dr. </p><p>Clovelly, I will make arrangements for you </p><p>to be shown over ray island as soon as it is </p><p>possible.” </p><p>CLOVELLY spread his hands helplessly. </p><p>“Under the circumstances,” he ac- </p><p>quiesced, “we can do nothing but submit. </p><p>But you must promise that we meet with no </p><p>treachery.” </p><p>The Chinaman inclined his head. “Have </p><p>no fear of that,” he assured us. “And now </p><p>I shall show you around. You shall see </p><p>that this is no wild dream of mine. It has </p><p>taken years to accrue the knowledge and </p><p>effects, but it is all to the one purpose.” </p><p>With his quick, silent walk, he crossed </p><p>over to the crimson curtain and pausing </p><p>before it, spoke for some moments in the </p><p>pure liquid Ho Man dialect. From inside </p><p>there came a rustle of silken garments and </p><p>suddenly, as we listened, there arose again </p><p>that evil voiceless murmuring that we had </p><p>heard on the previous occasion. Ho Ming </p><p>turned to and waved a hand in the direction </p><p>of the curtaingd aperture. </p><p>“My illustrious Father—The Great Bald </p><p>One—The Learned Wong K’tai, who first </p><p>wrested the priceless formula from the </p><p>Lama pigs and to whose patience and saint- </p><p>ly perseverance, this island owes its exis- </p><p>tence.”	v</p><p>So that was the solution of the peculiar </p><p>sounds, and I was about to pace forward, </p><p>when Ho Ming, with a peculiar smile held </p><p>out 'a restraining arm. He then picked up </p><p>a slim ivory wand, and with a quick move- </p><p>ment stabbed it at the curtain. Immediate- </p><p>ly there came a Szz and a bright flash as </p><p>something shot through the air. but so </p><p>quick—so unexpected—was the whole ac- </p><p>tion that I did not have time to glimpse </p><p>the object. The next moment the China- </p><p>man, with a bland smile, moved forward </p><p>and held aside the curtains.</p><p>The room into which we looked could </p><p>not have been more than six feet square, but </p><p>screened on all sides as it was by rich hang- </p><p>ings, it gave the illusion of depths that </p><p>was very cleverly carried out. The black </p><p>velvet hangings were worked with a be- </p><p>wildering array of birds and flowers, in </p><p>colours both rare and wonderful. Scarlet </p><p>parrots, blue peacocks were entwined with </p><p>crimson poppies and roses of every shade </p><p>and hue. Gaudy though it undoubtedly </p><p>was, there was nothing in it to offend the </p><p>eye, for the colours were blended with the </p><p>skill of an expert. </p><p>In the center of the room, in a huge chair </p><p>that almost enveloped the slight form, sat </p><p>the oldest Chinaman I have ever set eyes on. </p><p>He was thin to emaciation and the rich pur- </p><p>ple robe he wore hung in folds about his </p><p>skinny frame. His head, bowed slightly </p><p>with the weight of years, was as bald as ar </p><p>egg and the long beard that hung from his </p><p>chin was white as the driven snow. The </p><p>face was seamed with a thousand wrinkles </p><p>and only the beady eyes, sunk deep in the </p><p>lined countenance, gave a hint of vitality. </p><p>He sat motionless, like some grotesque idol, </p><p>a fit parent lo this place of sinister secrets. </p><p>Ho Ming entered the room and pausing </p><p>before the chair, fell upon his knees. For </p><p>some moments, there was a silence, then </p><p>slowly, like one in a trance, one claw-like </p><p>hand, yellow as ivory, was raised in salute. </p><p>For a second it remained poised, then, as </p><p>though its owner lacked strength to hold it </p><p>in place, it fell limply back onto the chair. </p><p>Ho Ming rose to his feet. </p><p>“The great One salutes you, and wishes </p><p>you well. Gentlemen, you may consider </p><p>yourselves doubly honoured.” </p><p>He re-crossed the room and as he made </p><p>his way through the doorway, the curtain </p><p>dropped behind him. Synonymous with it </p><p>came the swish and the flash, and the Orien- </p><p>tal with quick movement touched a portion </p><p>of the woodwork. Immediately the object </p><p>came lo rest and for the first time we saw </p><p>it. It was a blade, some six inches wide and </p><p>the width of the doorway, a blade razor- </p><p>edged and weighted at the top. It ran </p><p>down between the door-posls on a concealed </p><p>wire, very much on the principle of the</p><p>French device, the guillotine, at an almost </p><p>840 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>incredible speed. The Oriental released it, </p><p>and it disappeared into a slot in the floor. </p><p>“Quite Chinese,"’ he purred. “Borrowed </p><p>from the palaces of the Emperors. By the </p><p>way,” he turned to Follansbee, “It was as </p><p>well that I arrived when I did, this morning, </p><p>for had you stepped across the threshold, </p><p>you would have been cleft in half.” He </p><p>walked to the book-lined wall and moved </p><p>his hands in the circular manner we had </p><p>noticed before. With a click of concealed </p><p>machinery, the section swung back, and we </p><p>filed into the dimly lit passage. “Now,” </p><p>our guide cautioned us, “Keep close to me </p><p>and offer no resistance, no matter what hap- </p><p>pens.” </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>Awaiting the Storm </p><p>THE contrast betw%n the brightly lit </p><p>room and the semi-darkness of the pas- </p><p>sage was so great that for some moments I </p><p>could perceive nothing, far less distinguish </p><p>any objects. The luminous dial of my </p><p>watch told me that it was just past the noon </p><p>hour and 1 could not but help reflecting </p><p>that we had certainly spent a crowded hour. </p><p>It seemed incredible that all our strange </p><p>adventures had been compassed in such a </p><p>short space of time; already we seemed to </p><p>have spent months on the island, and Eng- </p><p>land and Prince Alfred’s Hospital seemed </p><p>very far away. </p><p>Gradually, as my eyes became accustomed </p><p>to the light, I made out the various doors </p><p>leading from the strange apartment. The </p><p>Oriental Ho Ming took the lead and we oth- </p><p>ers trailed behind him. At the end of the </p><p>passage he paused before a door. </p><p>“This,” our guide explained with a ges- </p><p>ture, “is the laboratory. Here it is that the </p><p>serum is compounded that speeds up our </p><p>workers and helps them to overcome the </p><p>laziness that they inherit from the anthro- </p><p>poid side of their nature. Adrenin, ob- </p><p>tained as you know, from the adrenals near </p><p>the kidneys, forms a large percentage of </p><p>the serum. Adrenin is the greatest and </p><p>most natural stimulant known to mankind.” </p><p>He threw open the door and we surveyed</p><p>a long low room, with wooden benchea </p><p>running the entire length. Upon these were </p><p>placed a heterogeneous collection of scien- </p><p>tific instruments—microscopes, galvano- </p><p>meters and centrifuges. Everything was </p><p>scrupulously clean and three assistants in </p><p>spotless overalls hovered silently about the </p><p>room. Ho Ming gave a sharp order and </p><p>immediately one of the men crossed to the </p><p>bench and procured a test tube half-full of </p><p>some dirty brown liquid. This he placed </p><p>in his master’s hand. </p><p>“This is the inoculation serum,” explained </p><p>the Chinaman. “You must understand that </p><p>the ape-glands are incredibly strong and </p><p>that if left to themselves, must ultimately </p><p>reduce their owner to a state of bestial </p><p>idiocy. To prevent this, an injection of the </p><p>serum is necessary at least once a week. </p><p>The result of the adrenin in the blood is </p><p>at once apparent. It speeds up the slug- </p><p>gish heart beat, drives fatigue from the </p><p>muscles, and prepares the body for emer- </p><p>gency function. A very simple formula”, </p><p>he returned the tube to its place as he spoke, </p><p>“I discovered it something like two years </p><p>ago.” </p><p>He closed the door and we retraced our </p><p>steps along the passage. “Removal of the </p><p>thyroids and parathyroids necessitates cut- </p><p>ting away certain portions of the larynx” </p><p>he was explaining to the doctor. We tried </p><p>cutting through the windpipe into the cri- </p><p>coid cartilage—” and he rambled away into </p><p>the realms of surgery with Clovelly listen- </p><p>ing delighted and entranced. </p><p>I took advantage of his immersion to </p><p>drop back with Follansbee. "What do you </p><p>think of it all, anyway?” I muttered. </p><p>He surveyed me for a moment, his grey </p><p>eyes lighted humorously. “Two things </p><p>strike me with perturbing force. One is </p><p>that our Oriental friend is a loyal fanatic </p><p>and means every word he says. The other </p><p>is that we are in the very devil of a hole and </p><p>I don’t mind telling you young fellow, that </p><p>just at present, 1 fail lo see the tiniest loop- </p><p>hole of escape.” </p><p>“Do you think the man is mad?” I mur- </p><p>mured, having digested the somewhat dis- </p><p>turbing statement of the other. </p><p>Follansbee shrugged his shoulders—“He </p><p>THE GLAND MEN OF THE ISLAND </p><p>841 </p><p>may be”, he assented. “There is no doubt </p><p>that he is clever—and cleverness and insan- </p><p>ity often go hand in hand.” </p><p>I glanced to where the two men were </p><p>holding excited converse. “I do believe that </p><p>Dr. Clovelly is really enjoying himself,"’ I </p><p>remarked softly. “He’s hanging on to the </p><p>Chinaman’s words as though they were </p><p>pearls of great price.” </p><p>The other man smiled, a trifle grimly. </p><p>“I think that ihe doctor will be quite safe,” </p><p>he returned. “It's little us that’s worrying </p><p>this child. You see, we may be guests of </p><p>honor for as long as the childish vanity of </p><p>our hosts continues, but one day, they'll run </p><p>short of raw material, and then—” he made </p><p>an expressive gesture. </p><p>I was about to reply, when the Chinaman </p><p>paused with his hand on another door. He </p><p>regarded us suspiciously as we walked up </p><p>together and his voice was as sweet as honey </p><p>as he observed. </p><p>“Do not linger behind, my friends,” he </p><p>glanced over his shoulder as he spoke. </p><p>“There are many strange things in the abode </p><p>of Ho Ming. Fingers that claw and grasp, </p><p>hands that tear and break. It is very fool- </p><p>ish to stray behind.” </p><p>WITH that he pushed the door and as </p><p>it swung open, we glimpsed a well- </p><p>lighted apartment, with twin rows of beds </p><p>running along either side. Around two of </p><p>the nearest, white screens were placed and </p><p>from behind one of these a faint moaning </p><p>emanated. Hje air was charged with the </p><p>acrid tang of carbolic and as before, every- </p><p>thing spoke of scrupulous attention to de- </p><p>tail. </p><p>“My hospital,” it was explained. “My </p><p>patients come here from the operating tab- </p><p>les and from here they emerge to the out- </p><p>buildings, to do their allotted share among </p><p>their fellows. There is no intervening per- </p><p>iod, which we know as convalescence. </p><p>A week in hospital is long enough for the </p><p>newly grafted gland to function. Then </p><p>sunlight, fresh air and hard work do the </p><p>rest. It is amazingly simple.” </p><p>“But,” I interpolated, “Where do you get </p><p>your material to work on? It must come </p><p>rather hard to find men willing to sacrifice </p><p>themselves to this sort of Roman holiday.” </p><p>“Convicts from the State Prisons furnish </p><p>us with much work,” was the cold reply. </p><p>“Murderers, servants, and occasionally a </p><p>few are pressed into service by my assist- </p><p>ants, who form a modern equivalent to </p><p>your old-time press-gang.” </p><p>I grinned a trifle rudely. “Bang goes </p><p>your dream of world revolution,” I return- </p><p>ed, “if that is how you progress. After </p><p>weeding your prisons clear of undesirable </p><p>characters the magnum opus will languish </p><p>and finally die of insufficient means of </p><p>support. </p><p>Ho Ming turned his unfathomable black </p><p>eyes upon me. “Presumptous fool,” he </p><p>said, coldly. “China now possesses an </p><p>army of six thousand men, drilled and per- </p><p>fect in the art of war. As soon as circum- </p><p>stances will allow sufficient serum will be </p><p>despatched and under the treatment of my </p><p>assistants, every soldier will become a </p><p>Gland Man. After that every man who en- </p><p>ters the army will be likewise glanded, and </p><p>in time we shall possess an entire army of </p><p>these supermen.'’ </p><p>I raised no more questions, for if the </p><p>Oriental was insane, there was assuredly </p><p>method in his madness. In fact the gigantic </p><p>scheme was too complete, and for the first </p><p>time, the true meaning of this man’s insane </p><p>dream chilled me with its appalling possi- </p><p>bilities. The doctor's voice broke in on my </p><p>reflections. </p><p>“And are all your operations successful?” </p><p>he asked. “In such a delicate business as </p><p>this, one would think ihe failures out- </p><p>weighed the successes.” </p><p>Ho Ming looked at the speaker, his eyes </p><p>alight with a peculiar gleam. “Yes,” he </p><p>said, slowly, “we do have failures, in spite </p><p>of our precautions. Before you see them, </p><p>I warn you—they are not pretty to look </p><p>upon.” </p><p>He led the way through a side door and </p><p>we found ourselves once more in the day </p><p>light. The weather had changed complete-</p><p>ly since our sojourn inside. The sky, bras- </p><p>sy before, was now almost clear, the hard </p><p>blue sullied by a thick band of black clouds </p><p>that spread themselves like some ebon cano- </p><p>py across the eastern sky. Little puffs of </p><p>842 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>wind stirred the dust and dried leaves at </p><p>our feet, whirling them into the blue. The </p><p>atmosphere was thick apd heavy, so heavy </p><p>indeed, that some difficulty was experienced </p><p>in breathing, and the sun poured down with </p><p>a fierce heat that was almost unbearable. </p><p>The silence was broken intermittently by a </p><p>low sibilant hum. </p><p>Follansbee glanced curiously around him. </p><p>“It’s coming,” he said appreciatively, “It’s </p><p>coming, and by Heaven, I pity this place </p><p>if it strikes it.” </p><p>We skirted the main building and passed </p><p>through the high wooden stockade till we </p><p>reached the outbuildings. Some little way </p><p>further on, we could perceive a number of </p><p>the queer inhabitants engaged in erecting </p><p>a new structure. They swung the huge tree- </p><p>trunks as though they were light sticks and </p><p>in an amazingly short time, the central </p><p>framework was raised. </p><p>We passed a long building, constructed </p><p>of rough hewn timbers, containing a num- </p><p>ber of small cubicles. Each separate room </p><p>had its neatly folded mattress and shining </p><p>eating utensils. The place contained no </p><p>comforts whatever—just the bare necessities </p><p>of living, and was obviously the domestic </p><p>quarters of the strange beings that Ho Ming </p><p>called his Gland Men. </p><p>The Revenge of Nature </p><p>A PECULIAR smell was predominant </p><p>here increasing in strength as we made </p><p>our way onward. Everyone is familiar </p><p>with the loathsome, animal smell, that is </p><p>prevalent wherever beasts are incarcerated. </p><p>It emanated from a tiny hillock, built over </p><p>an underground cellar. A gate led us down </p><p>about a dozen steps cut in the earth and </p><p>brought us up before a massive iron door, </p><p>with a barred grating set in the top. The </p><p>snapping and snarling of animals came </p><p>clearly to our ears, and the words of the </p><p>Oriental “they are not good to look upon” </p><p>took on fresh significance. </p><p>The Chinaman, who was in the lead, </p><p>stepped forward and sliding back the grat- </p><p>ing motioned me up. I peered in, scarce- </p><p>ly knowing what to expect, and hardly had</p><p>I	taken one brief glimpse when I recoiled</p><p>was a gasp of horror. Even Dante, in his </p><p>journey through the innermost Hells, could </p><p>scarcely have viewed such horrible crea- </p><p>tures as haunted that underground pit. </p><p>There must have been over a dozen of </p><p>them—loathsome—terrible. Some twisted </p><p>beyond any semblance of recognition, oth- </p><p>ers with stunted bodies and bloated appen- </p><p>dages growing on various parts of their </p><p>anatomy. They stood silent as I glimpsed </p><p>them, looking at me mildly with their blood- </p><p>shot eyes, gesticulating with their crooked, </p><p>shrunken limbs. But the crowning horror </p><p>was the undeniable fact that once these </p><p>Lhings had been men, even as you and I, </p><p>living—hating—breathing. </p><p>As I stumbled up the stairs, sick with </p><p>horror, 1 was joined by the Oriental, who </p><p>stood watching me with a sardonic smile </p><p>on his lips. 1 did not speak, but stood </p><p>there, drinking in the thick air in thirsty </p><p>gulps. And then suddenly it happened. </p><p>It began by the sunlight fading, and </p><p>glancing up, I saw lhat the monstrous black </p><p>cloud had overshadowed almost all the sky, </p><p>leaving only a portion over the sea, that </p><p>glowed eerily with an uncanny eLfin rad- </p><p>iance. The low intermittent humming had </p><p>risen in cadence and was coming nearer ev- </p><p>ery second. A patter of feet made me swing </p><p>round, and there, his face white with ter- </p><p>ror, was one of the overalled assistants. </p><p>He stepped up to the Chinaman and poured </p><p>forth a string of incoherent language, that </p><p>for a moment, eluded even his countryman. </p><p>Then I saw Ho Ming’s face turn a sickly </p><p>green, his eyes protruded, and he barked </p><p>back a question into the other’s face, and I </p><p>distinctly heard the name K’tai. Then </p><p>without a word, Ho Ming turned on his heel </p><p>and, side by side, Lhe two raced for the </p><p>main building as fast as they could move, </p><p>leaving me standing wide-eyed with amaze- </p><p>ment. </p><p>A moment laler I was joined by my com- </p><p>panions. and to them 1 explained the sudden </p><p>departure of the Chinaman. As I spoke, </p><p>several big drops of rain commenced to </p><p>fall, and Dr. Clovelly glanced anxiously at </p><p>flie sky. “Hullo!” he ejaculated, “Here’s </p><p>that storm that you promised us, Follans-</p><p>bee.” </p><p>THE GLAND MEN OF THE ISLAND </p><p>843 </p><p>But that gentleman jumped to his feet </p><p>as though he had been stung. “Storm be </p><p>damned,” he exclaimed, “That ‘storm’ is a </p><p>number one size typhoon, and it is heading </p><p>this way. I give it five seconds to strike </p><p>the island.” </p><p>THE terrific upheaval of Nature lasted </p><p>three hours, and to us adventurers, </p><p>crouched in the groaning swaying forest, </p><p>it was the final denounement of our astound- </p><p>ing adventures on the Island of the Gland </p><p>Men. Towards evening the hurricane </p><p>dropped, but the rain poured down with un- </p><p>bridled fury, sweeping and lashing the ve- </p><p>getation before it. Such a deluge it is al- </p><p>most impossible to describe, rather it was </p><p>as though the skies had opened and the sev- </p><p>en seas poured their waters through the gap. </p><p>Even in the thick of the matted vegetation, </p><p>we were drenched to the skin, and it was </p><p>almost dark when we eventually crawled </p><p>forth from our shelter and took our last look </p><p>at the Island. The downpour had abated </p><p>somewhat, but it still swept in our faces </p><p>with the sting of a whip-Iash, and at length, </p><p>wet, half-blinded and weighed down by the </p><p>weight of our sodden garments, we gazed </p><p>at what had once been the realization of a </p><p>fanatic’s dream. </p><p>Such a scene of destruction and chaos </p><p>beggars description. The sturdy buildings </p><p>had been swept away like match boxes be- </p><p>fore a summer breeze. The heaps of wood </p><p>and iron were still faintly smouldering and </p><p>when I remembered the volatile chemicals </p><p>that were ranged along the shelves, 1 per- </p><p>cived that combustion must have wrecked </p><p>quite as many of the edifices as the howling </p><p>typhoon. </p><p>There was the half-erected framework, </p><p>now splintered and scattered. There too, </p><p>the poor dumb beasts that had once been </p><p>men. The cataclysm had burst upon them </p><p>before their bestial minds had time to real- </p><p>ize its significance. The rain swept merci- </p><p>lessly down on the inanimate hairy bodies, </p><p>as though gloating in its power over mere </p><p>mortals. </p><p>The high stockade was, by some miracle, </p><p>still standing in places. In other places it </p><p>gaped open, showing the destruction within</p><p>the walls. Here the bodies were piled, </p><p>corpses torn, scratched and bitten, telling of </p><p>the panic that must have enveloped the com- </p><p>munity, as it fought for freedom. I won- </p><p>dered if any of the hideous denizens of the </p><p>underground pit had escaped, but a glance </p><p>assured me. Ihe ruins of the main build- </p><p>ing were piled feet high over the vault of </p><p>horror. </p><p>Of Ho Ming there was no sign. It was </p><p>impossible that he had lived through the </p><p>chaos that had enveloped the Island, but it </p><p>was hardly probable that everyone was </p><p>dead. We, to be sure, only owed our lives </p><p>to our sheltered positions, but there might </p><p>have been others. </p><p>The Island must have been situated in </p><p>the very centre of the catastrophe, otherwise </p><p>there was no manner of accounting for the </p><p>terrible amount of damage. It seemed </p><p>strange—ironical—that the toil and labour </p><p>of a decade should thus be destroyed in a </p><p>few hours. The Chinaman’s scheme had </p><p>been a marvel of completeness, but the best- </p><p>laid plans—. </p><p>We retraced our steps in silence, each one </p><p>a little chastened by the tragedy that we </p><p>had passed through. We were nearly to the </p><p>beach when 1 put the question. </p><p>“What made the Chinaman rush away like </p><p>he did?” 1 asked Follansbee. “He turned a </p><p>sickly colour and went for his life.” </p><p>“Didn't you say that you heard his fath- </p><p>er’s name mentioned?” the big man asked. </p><p>“Well, it’s obvious that the servant told him </p><p>of the coming storm and he rushed off to </p><p>comfort and protect his father. The pater- </p><p>nal reverence is very strongly developed in </p><p>the Oriental races, and he evidently cared </p><p>for nothing as long as his father was safe. </p><p>Recollect that all he had was made possible </p><p>by the sacrifice of his parents.” </p><p>We had reached the electric launch, </p><p>beached high and dry where we had left it. </p><p>As we swung it round, I voiced the unspoken </p><p>question of the trio. </p><p>“Will anyone believe us?” I ruminated, </p><p>‘’when we tell them where we have been </p><p>and what we have seen? I very much </p><p>doubt that I would, were a person to re-</p><p>count to me the—” </p><p>(Concluded on Page 895) </p><p>The Soulless Entity </p><p>By Anthony Pclchcr </p><p>Illustrated by Paul </p><p>“He put the knife in the robot’s hand and </p><p>caused the arm to raise.

His home, his labora- </p><p>tory and his office were cluttered with </p><p>clockwork, radio, and motor-operated jim- </p><p>cracks and his life was </p><p>filled with plans for </p><p>more and more odd </p><p>mechanical devices. </p><p>Some of the machines </p><p>had earned vast sums </p><p>for the inventor. </p><p>Others were useless ex- </p><p>cept as proofs of the </p><p>workability of Mar- </p><p>tinoff’s weird theories. </p><p>If it had not been </p><p>for his robots which </p><p>were among I h e </p><p>world’s greatest labor- </p><p>saving machines, Mar- </p><p>tmoff probably would </p><p>have been sent down </p><p>as a crank, but there </p><p>was no gainsaying his </p><p>genius. He was re- </p><p>garded with a degree </p><p>of respect and awe by </p><p>others in his field. </p><p>That a grim and </p><p>frightful tragedy lurk- </p><p>ed in the junk-like clut- </p><p>ter of Martinoffs sur- </p><p>roundings was sus- </p><p>pected by 110 one. </p><p>Nor did anybody even </p><p>dream the strange de- </p><p>velopments which were </p><p>to result from his ex- </p><p>periments until one </p><p>stormy night in Sep- </p><p>tember. </p><p>Yet it is not so </p><p>strange that fate should </p><p>play pranks when giv- </p><p>en such a heterogen- </p><p>eous mass of material </p><p>to work with. Indeed, fate and destiny </p><p>must have been sorely tempted by the clut-</p><p>ter of these weird devices which seemed half </p><p>human and half machine. </p><p>Like the planets, Martinoffs habits were </p><p>so regular that his movements could be pre- </p><p>dicted accurately in advance. Each day he </p><p>worked in his laboratory and shop from ele- </p><p>ven A. M. until five. Each night after din- </p><p>ner he worked at his home from seven until </p><p>heaven knows when. </p><p>He was at his office </p><p>only by appointment </p><p>and these business ap- </p><p>pointments were few— </p><p>for they usually bored </p><p>him beyond expres- </p><p>sion. </p><p>His only close asso- </p><p>ciate, Dr. Bliss Far- </p><p>11	um, was strikingly in</p><p>contrast to him. Far- </p><p>num was a surgeon </p><p>who worked in blood, </p><p>nerves, bone, tissue </p><p>and muscle, while </p><p>Martinoff was working </p><p>in metal. Dr. Farnum </p><p>had a flair for radio </p><p>and was quite an adept </p><p>in this new science, </p><p>which fact had brought </p><p>the two together in a </p><p>fast enduring friend- </p><p>ship. </p><p>When the dread </p><p>thing happened that </p><p>forms the basis of this </p><p>strange story, Martiu- </p><p>off was alone in his </p><p>home. </p><p>He had just com- </p><p>pleted a new mechani- </p><p>cal man. Fashioned </p><p>of inert material, it was </p><p>quite human in shape </p><p>and appearance. It </p><p>had a wax facc, blink- </p><p>ing electric eyes and a </p><p>phonographic voice </p><p>which could be ampli- </p><p>fied to an altogether </p><p>inhuman volume. </p><p>On that fateful rainy night the metal mon- </p><p>ster stood back near the walls, its metal </p><p>arms extended as if in greeting, its electric </p><p>orbs blinking. Martinoff sat at his desk </p><p>r/ TT is only in the past few\ </p><p>1 years that we have </p><p>learned how much like a </p><p>very complicated bit of </p><p>mechanism we are. As far </p><p>as our physical processes </p><p>are concerned there is noth- </p><p>ing mysterious or meta- </p><p>physical at all; and many </p><p>scientists confidently assert </p><p>that artificial organs can </p><p>be installed to work as well </p><p>or even better than our </p><p>natural ones. Thus arti- </p><p>ficial hearts have been used </p><p>successfully on animals and </p><p>their application to human </p><p>beings is predicted next. </p><p>But it is a far cry from </p><p>the substitution of physical </p><p>organs to the use of arti- </p><p>ficial means of stimulating </p><p>brain impulses. Except for </p><p>our purely abstract </p><p>thoughts our brains work </p><p>because of the stimuli sent </p><p>to them throughnerves.Each </p><p>of the hundreds of thou- </p><p>sands of nerve ends has the </p><p>possibility when stimulated </p><p>of sending a message to the </p><p>brain to do or not to do </p><p>some act. But suppose it </p><p>were possible to send such </p><p>stimuli artificially and by </p><p>appropriate means to even </p><p>control the response of the </p><p>brain. Then we have a </p><p>complete control over a </p><p>man’s mind and body and </p><p>perhaps over his — soul! </p><p>That is the theme of this </p><p>^ very unusual story. </p><p>846 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>opposite browsing over ancient scientific </p><p>lore. The robot, controlled by radio im- </p><p>pulse, could count, add, subtract, multi- </p><p>ply, recite the Lord’s prayer and do a good </p><p>day’s manual labor; but, as has been said, </p><p>on this particular night it simply stood there </p><p>with its back toward the wall. </p><p>It was in full tune and its electric eyes </p><p>appeared to be staring banefullv at the full- </p><p>ness of Martinoff’s throat. On the table </p><p>was a long, keen bladed Turkish knife, used </p><p>by Martinoff to open his mail. </p><p>Such is the scene in Martinoff’s study as </p><p>it was reconstructed after sudden and bloody </p><p>murder had been done. </p><p>to assist him in fashioning mechanical </p><p>things, a work I loved. </p><p>“Sometimes he would upbraid me for </p><p>stupidity in fashioning metal parts, but al- </p><p>ways with a kindly, fatherly air.

The wind moan- </p><p>ed and whistled. </p><p>Otto, Marlinoff’s per- </p><p>sonal attendant—the only </p><p>servant on duty that </p><p>night—said later that he </p><p>had been obsessed by an </p><p>uncanny fear all evening </p><p>and at times had felt like </p><p>rushing screaming from </p><p>the quaint old house. </p><p>He told this story tear- </p><p>fully, haltingly, and it </p><p>had the ring of truth des- </p><p>pite its almost unbelieva- </p><p>ble character. When questioned by detec- </p><p>tives he said: “I loved Martinoff with a de- </p><p>votion that I cannot describe though he </p><p>hardly said a word to me from one week’s </p><p>end to the other.

It gurgled mech- </p><p>anically and just then I heard a groan, a hu- </p><p>man groan, sir, and I heard a body fall. I </p><p>was nervous, I was all upset, I was fright- </p><p>ened. I did a most unmanly thing, sir. I </p><p>dropped the tray there at the door and ran </p><p>wildly out in the rain.” </p><p>“Where did you go?” </p><p>“Nowhere, I just ran out, probably fifty </p><p>feet from the house. Then I stopped and </p><p>looked back. My knees were trembling, </p><p>my heart was pounding and my head was </p><p>hot. But the rain must have cooled me off </p><p>some for I realized what a coward I had </p><p>been and I went back to the house. Then </p><p>steeling my courage I entered and you know </p><p>what was there-” </p><p>“What was there?” </p><p>“Just the way it was after I phoned you </p><p>r.nd you came in dripping and arrested me.” </p><p>The Tragedy Reconstructed </p><p>THE detective was blustering with impa- </p><p>tience. He banged his fist on a desk </p><p>and swore full well-rounded oaths. He </p><p>walked up and down while others at the </p><p>grilling sat and watched him, and while Ot- </p><p>to waved back and forth in his chair, his </p><p>hands to his head. </p><p>Suddenly the detective banged his big </p><p>fist on a table, around which the inquisitors </p><p>and the prisoner sat, and commanded:., </p><p>“Tell us what you saw before we got </p><p>there.” </p><p>Otto was jarred out of his fit of emotion. </p><p>He raised his haggard, thin, angular features </p><p>to the detective and pleaded: “Do I have to </p><p>go all over that again?” </p><p>“Absolutely, and damn quick,” thundered</p><p>the detective. Otto proceeded. </p><p>“My poor master was lying at the foot of </p><p>the thing—the horrible blinking man-mach- </p><p>ine. The knife was there beside him. The </p><p>wound was on his neck. Blood was on the </p><p>floor. On his head was another wound, it </p><p>bled too. I looked at the machine and there </p><p>on its outstretched metal hand was blood, </p><p>sir, blood and a tuft of human hair. </p><p>“I liked all but falling where I stood. I </p><p>trembled and cried out. I moved about </p><p>some blit I was conscious that I should not </p><p>disturb anything. Then I forced myself to </p><p>action and phoned you, sir. I phoned you </p><p>that murder had been done. I did not go </p><p>back in the room. The rest you know.” </p><p>The detective had heard Otto tell this story </p><p>probably twenty times. Each time he told </p><p>it tlie details were exactly the same. There </p><p>was not the slightest discrepancy. </p><p>“Well, that’s that,” said the detective ser- </p><p>geant, and Otto was led back to a cell. </p><p>Turning to his co-workers, tlie detective </p><p>sergeant said with conviction: “That guy is </p><p>telling the God’s truth and you can’t try a </p><p>machine for murder.” </p><p>“You mean the robot committed the mur- </p><p>der?” asked a thoughtful individual sitting </p><p>at the end of the table. </p><p>“I do. It is hard to believe but what else </p><p>is there to believe. That machine was too </p><p>human to be safe. It had everything hu- </p><p>man but a heart and braia, and a human </p><p>widiout a heart and a brain might be ex- </p><p>pected to commit murder.” </p><p>Answering the look incredulity on all </p><p>the faces he added: “I mean this: Martinoff </p><p>was fooling with the mechanism. He evi- </p><p>dently put the knife in the robot’s hand </p><p>and caused the arm to raise. Why, I don’t </p><p>know. Then something went wrong and the </p><p>arm descended. The metal of the hand </p><p>brushed the side of Martinoff’a head, cutting </p><p>the scalp and tearing loose a tuft of hair </p><p>and the knife was driven into Martinoff’s </p><p>neck. Martinoff tjien fell against the mach- </p><p>ine, probably he tripped over a wire; and </p><p>jarring some mechanism. This caused the </p><p>robot to cry out in an amplified voice and </p><p>it caused the hand to open and drop the</p><p>knife to the floor. </p><p>“Martinoff, of course, dropped like a log. </p><p>Death came within a few minutes while Otto </p><p>was running around without enough pres- </p><p>ence of mind to know what to do.” </p><p>Odd as was this explanation of the death </p><p>it was the one generally accepted by the </p><p>newspapers and public and in due time </p><p>Otto was released from custody. </p><p>848 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>There was one person, however, who did </p><p>not accept this explanation of the crime. </p><p>This single disbeliever in the mechanical </p><p>murder theory was Dr. Farnum, closest </p><p>friend of Martinoff. He determined to </p><p>solve the mystery by a method which was as </p><p>bizarre, fantastical and unearthly as the un- </p><p>canny crime itself. He gave up his surgical </p><p>practice and devoted all his time to delv- </p><p>ing into what appeared to him as the un- </p><p>solved mystery of Martinoff’s murder. </p><p>His first act in this direction was to hire </p><p>Otto immediately on his release from jail. </p><p>He gave him a position as attendant in his </p><p>household, and later placed him under the </p><p>direction of a woman nurse, a Miss Hilda </p><p>Spencer. The nurse was ordered to in- </p><p>struct Otto in the rudiments of nursing. </p><p>Both Miss Spence and Otto thought this an </p><p>unusual arrangement but they followed in- </p><p>structions without comment. Miss Spence, </p><p>a beautiful blonde type, at first believed </p><p>Otto to be of ordinary intelligence. She </p><p>was destined to learn later that he was real- </p><p>ly quite an intelligent fellow and that he </p><p>fairly absorbed information. </p><p>The truth was that Otto, while dog-like in </p><p>faithful service, was of good blood and </p><p>came from a family well-educated in Rus- </p><p>sia. He was anxious to advance in his new </p><p>world and was tireless in his efforts to grasp </p><p>the learning that would fit him as a practi- </p><p>cal nurse. He was agreeable, had a pleas- </p><p>ing personality. </p><p>CHAPTER H </p><p>The Confession </p><p>IT was three months after Otto had come </p><p>into the household of Dr. Farnum, that </p><p>the surgeon called him into conference. </p><p>Otto found Miss Spence already seated and </p><p>was glad that she was to hear whatever the </p><p>doctor had to say. </p><p>“You two,” began the surgeon without </p><p>preliminaries, “are to assist me in a most </p><p>unusual—I might say startling and unheard </p><p>of experiment—and you must not fail me. </p><p>If you do it will mean endless trouble and </p><p>criticism for all of us.” </p><p>The two merely nodded their assent and</p><p>the doctor proceeded. </p><p>“Otto,” he said, “I have never felt right </p><p>about the killing of my friend, Martinoff, </p><p>or should I call it a murder? I positively </p><p>do not believe that he was killed by his </p><p>strange man-machine as the coroner finally </p><p>decided. I am going to tell you of a con- </p><p>versation 1 had with Martinoff the last time </p><p>we were together and from it you will gath- </p><p>er what we now have ahead of us. </p><p>“Martinoff and I were dining at the </p><p>Science Club. He told me he had perfected </p><p>his new man-machine and. for reasotis of my </p><p>own, I was interested more than you might </p><p>imagine. When he had explained the </p><p>mechanism in detail I told him of an idea </p><p>1 had long had in mind. </p><p>“ ‘Mechanical engineers’ I said, ‘are busy </p><p>making men of machines, and I believe it </p><p>would be possible for me to make a machine </p><p>out of a man.’ </p><p>‘“What! How do you mean?’ he asked </p><p>and his voice rang with incredulity. </p><p>“ ‘You know,’ I said, ‘that I am a deep </p><p>student of radio and I believe every man has </p><p>in his nervous system a complete radio re- </p><p>ceiving set that could be hooked up with </p><p>platinum wires to a mechanical instrument </p><p>or instruments that would cause the human </p><p>to register and act upon radio impulses. I </p><p>do not mean for him to respond to the trans- </p><p>formed waves or spoken word but the actual </p><p>Hertzian waves before they are transformed </p><p>into sound waves.’ </p><p>“ ‘Quite interesting,’ commented Martin- </p><p>off, ‘why don’t you go ahead and make such </p><p>a machine-man?’ </p><p>“ ‘Because,’ I replied, ‘to do so I would </p><p>have to kill out the will or the volition of the </p><p>man before he would cease to be a thinking </p><p>human and before he could be a machine in </p><p>the flesh. Ethics would hardly permit of </p><p>such vivisection,’ I explained, and I had oth- </p><p>er compunctions. I explained that I had </p><p>already invented a unit which could be used </p><p>in such an experiment but that I had hesita- </p><p>ted to use it even on larger species of dumb </p><p>animals. </p><p>“I have brought you two here now to tell </p><p>you that cthics no longer figure in this mat-</p><p>ter and my compunctions have fled. I am </p><p>THE SOULLESS ENTITY </p><p>84.9 </p><p>going to find the man who murdered my </p><p>friend Martinoff and when 1 do he will be </p><p>the subject of my experiments. If these ex- </p><p>periments are successful this criminal will </p><p>become the first mechanically operated hu- </p><p>man being the world has ever known. </p><p>“It will really serve him right and will </p><p>be good for him, because by depriving him </p><p>of his free will and volition I will have </p><p>curbed his criminal tendencies. I also will </p><p>have made him a useful machine capable of </p><p>heavy manual labor without the sense or the </p><p>desire to protest against his fate. Do I </p><p>make myself quite clear?” </p><p>“I follow you,” said the girl. </p><p>“I am at your service,” said Otto, “but </p><p>how do you propose lo find this suspected </p><p>murdered and how do you propose to prove </p><p>his guilt beyond question?” </p><p>“Leave that to me,” said the surgeon fin- </p><p>ally and then he brought forth a small </p><p>round object with attached wires. “Look,” </p><p>he said, “and behold my impulsaphone with </p><p>which I propose to transform a human be- </p><p>ing into a machine.” </p><p>OTTO and Miss Spence were all interest. </p><p>They beheld a small object which re- </p><p>sembled the receiving unit of a telephone. </p><p>Otto noted that the attached wires were of </p><p>platinum and that they were “frayed” at the </p><p>ends, like frayed out string, into many ends </p><p>of fine wire. They were so fine in fact as </p><p>to be almost microscopic. Each multiple </p><p>wire end was again “frayed” or divided into </p><p>hundreds of additional fine terminals. </p><p>When Dr. Farnum saw Otto examining these </p><p>minute wires he said: </p><p>‘The ends of those wires correspond with </p><p>the branching out of tiny nerve lines from </p><p>a neurone or nerve cell. It is my purpose </p><p>to plant this mass of branched wires at </p><p>points where they will interlace and com- </p><p>municate with important nerve centers in </p><p>the human body. </p><p>“It will be a painful operation but the </p><p>pain will pass as the system becomes accus- </p><p>tomed to the new conditions. The nervous </p><p>system is simply a telephone system anyway</p><p>with the brain as the central office and the </p><p>nerve centers as the branch exchanges and </p><p>the nerves as the wires. </p><p>“In the human body there are many bun- </p><p>dles of nerves or nerve trunks, just as there </p><p>are trunks in a telephone system. The lar- </p><p>gest nerve trunk is the spinal column and I </p><p>will extend minute platinum wires to every </p><p>important nerve center and ganglion. This </p><p>means we will hook up with the spinal cord </p><p>at every vertebrae and that tiny platinum </p><p>wires will be planted at all important re- </p><p>flex and other nerve centers. </p><p>“Many surgical operations, under a com- </p><p>plete anesthetic, will be necessary and that </p><p>is all that you two need to know at pre- </p><p>sent. Now we will go about finding the </p><p>killer.” </p><p>The surgeon was addressing his remarks </p><p>to Otto but he had known Miss Spence long </p><p>enough to be sure she would not miss a </p><p>word and that she needed no special in- </p><p>struction. . </p><p>“You saw no one in the house on the </p><p>night Martinoff met his death?” </p><p>“No one,” said Otto, and his words were </p><p>positive. </p><p>“Yet,” said the doctor, “there was some- </p><p>one there.” He paused for his words to </p><p>have their effect. </p><p>“How do you know?” inquired Otto, sur- </p><p>prised. </p><p>“I know,” said the doctor slowly, “that </p><p>there was someone hiding in the room with </p><p>Martinoff and that he came there before the </p><p>downpour of rain started.” </p><p>“How do you know?” insisted Otto. </p><p>“I know because the machine could not </p><p>have killed Martinoff in the manner des- </p><p>cribed and if the killer had entered before </p><p>the rain started he would have left his </p><p>marks—wet ones. It was a heavy rain. </p><p>“Some man killed Martinoff, evidently </p><p>for revenge. He was hiding in the room </p><p>when you entered after the crime and he left </p><p>when you ran from the house. You ran </p><p>out the front way. He ran out the back.</p><p>He had a car waiting near the lower road </p><p>and made his escape back to New York. </p><p>That is my theory.” </p><p>“Quite possible,” agreed Otto, “but I real- </p><p>ly do not know. Why are you sure that it </p><p>was a man?” </p><p>“Because of the great force of the blow. </p><p>I have treated hundreds of knife wounds </p><p>850 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>and experience and observation proves that </p><p>wounds inflicted by a weapon in the hands </p><p>of a woman are different from those in- </p><p>flicted by a man.” </p><p>“0, I see,” said Otto. </p><p>“Now listen, Otto,” began the doctor </p><p>again, seriously, “you can help me by fill- </p><p>ing in the gaps in my deductions. We all </p><p>believe the doctor had no enemies. Now 1 </p><p>want to know who were his visitors. Who </p><p>came regularly to his house?” </p><p>“Nobody,” emphatically asserted Otto. </p><p>“O, yes, there was someone,’’ said the sur- </p><p>geon with assurance. </p><p>“No, one.” </p><p>“Now think.” </p><p>“I am thinking. There was no one at all, </p><p>no—. 0, maybe you mean the typist, the </p><p>girl. That was strange. She came once in </p><p>a while in the evening when Martinoff had </p><p>notes he wanted to set down.” </p><p>“I thought so,” observed the surgeon with </p><p>evident satisfaction. “Tell us all about her. </p><p>You see we are working by an old rule— </p><p>first find the woman. Now what about </p><p>her?” </p><p>“I don’t know much about her. You said </p><p>a man did it. This is a woman, a woman </p><p>typist.” </p><p>“The woman will lead us to the man,” </p><p>said the surgeon. “Tell us about her. I </p><p>have reason to suspect someone well ac- </p><p>quainted with Martinoffs habits and the </p><p>room where the murder was committed.” </p><p>“All I know was Martinoff got her name </p><p>from a charity list. She was from one of </p><p>the rougher districts. She had a bad rec- </p><p>ord but was trying to go straight, she said. </p><p>Martinoff gave her a chance. She was pret- </p><p>ty in a rough way and seemed willing and </p><p>anxious to please. She behaved well, the </p><p>little I saw of her except, she was given to </p><p>slang, which nettled Martinoff.” </p><p>“Did she ever act as though she was </p><p>trying to impress Martinoff?”</p><p>“No.” </p><p>“Or you?” </p><p>“0, no indeed. Why no, sir.” </p><p>“What was her name?” </p><p>“Dorothy. Dottie she liked to be called.” </p><p>“Her last name?” </p><p>“I don’t recall. Let me see, it was a </p><p>Russian name. He got her from a Russian </p><p>aid society, the Helping Hand, or something </p><p>like that. Let me see,—no, I can’t recall.” </p><p>“No need to,” decided the doctor. “Look </p><p>her up tomorrow through this Helping </p><p>Hand agency. When you get her name and </p><p>address I will engage detectives to get us </p><p>all further information we may require. </p><p>Good night to both of you. When 1 have </p><p>anything further of interest 1 will confide </p><p>in you.” </p><p>Setting The Trap </p><p>IT was just one week after Otto obtained </p><p>the required name and address that Dr. </p><p>Farnum received a report from his detec- </p><p>tive agency.	0</p><p>"Dot Borsovich, reputed Russian </p><p>agitator and Red, served eighteen </p><p>months on the Island for a confidence </p><p>game. Her male accomplice escaped </p><p>detection. Has only one male admir- </p><p>er, an old friend who knew her in </p><p>Russia. He is Nick Solokoff, big and </p><p>burly, but auiet mannered. They at- </p><p>tend radical meetings but their only </p><p>real interest is in quick and easy mon- </p><p>ey. The man is a lucky gambler. </p><p>Politics with them appears to be a </p><p>subterfuge to hide their real activities. </p><p>Solokoff has no police record but is </p><p>known in the underworld as a badger </p><p>worker, a form of crime involving a </p><p>confidence game followed by extortion </p><p>at the point of a gun.” </p><p>“I thought so,” said Dr. Farnum, after </p><p>reading the report. </p><p>A few nights later Dr. Farnum sat in a </p><p>Russian restaurant. He appeared to be</p><p>waiting for someone. </p><p>The scene about him was one of wild </p><p>gaiety. Laughter was loud and quips of a </p><p>rough nature were being exchanged with </p><p>abandon and it was apparent that more </p><p>than food was being dispensed. A Gypsy </p><p>string band was playing and the dancing </p><p>space in the center was crowded. The form </p><p>of dancing was anything but refined. No </p><p>one could be a stranger long in such a </p><p>place. </p><p>The surgeon assumed the air of one thor- </p><p>oughly familiar with such scenes and heart- </p><p>ily in sympathy with the crowd. More than </p><p>one feminine glance was directed at his </p><p>THE SOULLESS ENTITY </p><p>851 </p><p>table. This ogling he appeared to accept </p><p>in good nature but with no further en- </p><p>couragement. Soon a large florid man en- </p><p>tered with a frowzy female. </p><p>Once they were seated Dr. Farnum called </p><p>a waiter and sent over a note scribbled on a </p><p>prescription blank, the printed head of </p><p>which he was careful lo lear off. The note </p><p>read: </p><p>“I am told you can take me to the house </p><p>of Alex, the Greek. I will pay you well </p><p>for your trouble.” </p><p>The big Russian scanned the note. The </p><p>waiter furtively indicated the doctor’s </p><p>table. Taking leave of the trowzy female </p><p>abruptly, the big Russian, after scanning </p><p>the surgeon suspiciously, came-over to hia </p><p>table.	\</p><p>The surgeon bubbled with an affability </p><p>which immediately disarmed suspicion. </p><p>The Russian sat down. </p><p>“Where did you get the idea that I knew </p><p>Alex, the Greek?” he asked. </p><p>“Simple,” chortled the surgeon. “I play </p><p>once in a while for high stakes. A dealer </p><p>in the Cottage Club told me I would find </p><p>you here and that you would introduce me </p><p>at the place of Alex, where I am told they </p><p>can cover big bets. You are Nick Solok- </p><p>off, are you not?” </p><p>“Who wants to know?” </p><p>“Well, it doesn't matter who you are. </p><p>Can you make il possible for me to risk a </p><p>few thousand at the place of Alex?” replied </p><p>the surgeon with an air of one entirely at </p><p>peace with the world. </p><p>“Nothing easier,” said the Russian, “but </p><p>where do I come in?” </p><p>“I will stake you with one hundred dol- </p><p>lars,” said Dr. Farnum, “and, besides, should </p><p>I win I will declare you in for one half the </p><p>winnings. My car is outside waiting. </p><p>Shall we go?” </p><p>“On our way,” replied the Russian, with</p><p>a great laugh, for ihe surgeon’s affability </p><p>was not only disarming but was also con- </p><p>tagious. </p><p>“A little drink before we go?” question- </p><p>ed the surgeon. </p><p>“You’re on,” agreed the Russian. </p><p>The drinks were served. Just as the big </p><p>Russian reached for his drink the surgeon </p><p>distracted his attention by a remark: </p><p>“Who is lhat important individual back </p><p>of the desk?” he asked. </p><p>Ihe big Russian turned half around and </p><p>as he did the surgeon dropped a white pow- </p><p>der in his drink. </p><p>“O, that’s old Ivan, himself. He owns </p><p>ihe place.” </p><p>“Quite an interesting character,” said </p><p>the doctor, as they quaffed their liquor and </p><p>left the place, the Russian waving a fare- </p><p>well to the female he was leaving behind. </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>A Strange Proposal </p><p>THE two piled into the doctor’s car, </p><p>which was waiting, with Otto at the </p><p>wheel. The Russian gave an address and </p><p>the car sped away. Within a few minutes </p><p>he was unconscious from the drug admin- </p><p>istered in his drink and was leaning heav- </p><p>ily on the surgeon’s shoulder. Dr. Far- </p><p>num was satisfied that at last he had the </p><p>murderer .of his friend helpless and com- </p><p>pletely in his power. </p><p>He was not vindictive or revengeful but </p><p>neither was he in a frame of mind to adopt </p><p>gentle methods in what he had determined </p><p>to accomplish. If Solokoff had been con- </p><p>scious and could have realized the fate in </p><p>store for him he would probably have chos- </p><p>en a quick death rather than to yield to </p><p>his terrible destiny. </p><p>Otto drove directly to the offices of the </p><p>famous surgeon. Solokoff was laid on an </p><p>operating table in the room used by the sur- </p><p>geon for his private patients, and was se- </p><p>curely strapped down. Then nature was </p><p>allowed to lake its course and in due time</p><p>Solokoff, doomed to be ihe subject in one </p><p>of ihe most astounding experiments ever </p><p>recorded in human annals, awoke. He </p><p>looked about him in a dazed manner. </p><p>“Keep still, it will do you no good to make </p><p>an outcry,” were the first words he heard </p><p>and it was Dr. Farnum who was speaking. </p><p>“Solokoff,’’ added ihe surgeon, purposely </p><p>toning his voice lo a deep and ominous note, </p><p>“you murdered my friend.” </p><p>852 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>Solokoff who could not see who was </p><p>speaking did not answer; but there was a </p><p>visible straining at his bonds. His head </p><p>ached from the effects of the drug and his </p><p>vitality was low. He was in the right state </p><p>for a severe and successful grilling. The </p><p>deep, uncanny voice continued. </p><p>“Martinoff was a scientist. You killed </p><p>him and to atone you will now sign a paper </p><p>before witnesses giving your body, after </p><p>death, to the advancement of science. You </p><p>will sign now. If you do not, you will die </p><p>a horrible death within a few hours. I </p><p>have you at my mercy.” </p><p>“I’ll see you in hell before I sign any- </p><p>thing,” blurted the Russian, his voice in- </p><p>tensely agitated. </p><p>“If you sign I will see that Dot goes free. </p><p>If you do not sign we will send Dot to the </p><p>chair with you. Now let’s see what kind </p><p>of a man you are.” </p><p>“I will sign,” said Solokoff, in a tired </p><p>voice, “but I ain’t dead yet. Remember </p><p>that.” </p><p>A document which had been prepared and </p><p>kept in readiness was produced and Otto, </p><p>Miss Spence and a notary public were sum- </p><p>moned. </p><p>Dr. Farnum addressed them simply, “This </p><p>patient wishes to sign his will in which he </p><p>gives his body to science after his death.” </p><p>One arm of the patient was released. </p><p>He was handed the paper and a fountain </p><p>pen and without a word he signed the docu- </p><p>ment. “You may go now,” said Dr. Farnum </p><p>turning to the others, “I intend to operate </p><p>immediately.” They turned to depart. The </p><p>surgeon had mentioned operating to note </p><p>the effect of his words on the Russian. </p><p>Solokoff strained at his bonds and started </p><p>to cry out in his native tongue. </p><p>“Keep still,” said the deep voice again. </p><p>“Keep still or I will kill you.” The face </p><p>of the Russian was ashen. He made no </p><p>furtlier outcry. He was able to half turn </p><p>his head and as he did so he saw his ac-</p><p>quaintance of the restaurant. Amazement </p><p>clouded his features. </p><p>“You?” he half questioned with an oath. </p><p>“Yes, I am Dr. Farnum, lifelong friend of </p><p>Martinoff, and it is with me you will have </p><p>to deal.” </p><p>Solokoff noted that the doctor had a hy- </p><p>podermic syringe in his hands. He heard </p><p>Farnum go lo the phone and call the police, </p><p>saying that he had the murderer of Martin- </p><p>off in custody. Again he strained heavily </p><p>at his bonds but an instant later the hypo- </p><p>dermic syringe was forced home in one of </p><p>his arms. Gradually he sank into a deep </p><p>sleep. </p><p>The Confession </p><p>THE detective sergeant who had handled </p><p>the Martinoff case soon arrived with </p><p>four assistants. Otto and Miss Spence were </p><p>summoned. </p><p>Addressing the detective Dr. Farnum said </p><p>slowly, “Officer, 1 have taken the liberty to </p><p>administer to this prisoner a liberal dosage </p><p>of scopolamine, the truth-compelling drug, </p><p>and under its influence you will hear a con- </p><p>fession of Martinoff’s murder. Should the </p><p>court refuse lo admit ihis confession in evi- </p><p>dence, we still have other evidence of a </p><p>damning nature. </p><p>“My detectives found this man’s finger </p><p>prints on the sides of Martinoff’s robot. </p><p>His revolver, which he feared to use, will </p><p>be found in a Westchester County storm </p><p>sewer. The proprietor and five men in a </p><p>pool room were approached by this man in </p><p>an attempt to arrange an alibi. My detec- </p><p>tives threatened the six with arrest for con- </p><p>spiracy and they signed affidavits telling </p><p>the whole and the true story.” </p><p>“What’s the idea of tieing him up this </p><p>way and filling him full of dope?” asked </p><p>the detective. “Why didn’t you call us </p><p>sooner?” </p><p>“I called you as soon as was feasible,” </p><p>replied the surgeon in a tone that brooked </p><p>no interference. “He was my patient be- </p><p>fore he was your prisoner, and I wanted to </p><p>hear the story from his own lips. I have </p><p>faith in scopolamine, and under its influ-</p><p>ence he will tell us the complete story.” </p><p>The patient already had begun to talk. </p><p>“I didn’t intend to kill him,” began the </p><p>confession, low and clear, and in Russian. </p><p>“Talk English,” commanded the surgeon. </p><p>“I did not mean to kill him,” began the </p><p>voice, this time in English. </p><p>THE SOULLESS ENTITY </p><p>853 </p><p>“Begin at the beginning,” commanded the </p><p>surgeon. </p><p>The story was clear and connected. </p><p>“It was a badger game.” (The badger </p><p>game is lo get some prominent and </p><p>wealthy man as a victim. The victim is </p><p>forced into a compromising position with a </p><p>woman and the man posing as the woman's </p><p>husband rushes in with accusations and in </p><p>a great rage. He demands prompt payment </p><p>for his injured feelings and backs his de- </p><p>mand by flourishing a revolver. There is </p><p>no idea to commit murder and when a mur- </p><p>der results it is because the victim shows </p><p>fight or messes things up so that the man </p><p>has to kill him to get away.) </p><p>“Using a charity dodge, Dot Borsovich </p><p>would get employment with men of money </p><p>and then 1 would come along and shake him </p><p>down for as much as I could get. </p><p>“Martinoff paid no attention to Dot out- </p><p>side of business and we couldn’t frame him </p><p>with a badger racket so I decided to stick </p><p>him up and get what I could. I had been </p><p>losing heavily at gambling and we had to </p><p>have some money. </p><p>“Dot let me in early in the evening and </p><p>I hid behind that damned iron man. It was </p><p>that crazy, praying metal thing that got on </p><p>my nerves. When Martinoff started it </p><p>counting and saying prayers it got me and </p><p>I couldn’t move. Once he ordered it lo </p><p>walk and I thought I was going to stand </p><p>clearly revealed, but the thing just took a </p><p>few steps forward and then back. It kept </p><p>between me and Martinoff and he did not </p><p>see me. </p><p>“The rain and the whir of the insides of </p><p>the robot got me plum crazy. I was hop- </p><p>ing he would go to bed and let me gel out </p><p>but he didn’t.. He came lo the machine </p><p>and reached around it and touched me. </p><p>He reached in then and caught me arid I put </p><p>my gun in my pocket and grabbed him. </p><p>He started to fight and I heard a noise like </p><p>footsteps coming closer and closer. I was </p><p>afraid to shoot so I jumped to the tabic and </p><p>grabbed the knife and brought it down on </p><p>his neck. He fell against the thing, striking</p><p>his head against its outstretched hand, then </p><p>slid to the floor. </p><p>“That thing, that damned iron man, with </p><p>the blinking eyes and wax face, it wobbled, </p><p>then hell, if it didn’t shout, ‘Our Father, </p><p>who art in Heaven.’ I grabbed it to steady </p><p>it. Then I wiped the handle of the knife </p><p>with my handkerchief to remove finger </p><p>prints but I forgot lo wipe the metal sides </p><p>of the machine where I touched it.” </p><p>The form on the operating table stirred </p><p>restlessly and the others in the room shud- </p><p>dered. </p><p>"I was so scared,” continued the voice, </p><p>“that I nearly dropped dead. There I stood </p><p>looking at Martinoff bleeding and that </p><p>damned thing, thal iron man with white wax </p><p>face and wobbling arms looked straight at </p><p>me and blinked and blinked. Then I heard </p><p>a knock on the door. </p><p>“I made one jump out the window and </p><p>ran down the back gravel path and through </p><p>the bushes to where Dot was waiting in the </p><p>car all ihat time in the rain. She started </p><p>to cuss me and I said, 'For God’s sake, Dot, </p><p>keep still. I killed him.’ She started to </p><p>whimper. I slowed up at the first storm </p><p>sewer, threw ihe gun down and came to </p><p>New York. I didn’t breathe easy again </p><p>night or day and 1 went around and saw </p><p>the gang and tried to frame up an alibi. </p><p>Then ihe cops said the. machine killed Mar- </p><p>tinoff and I felt safe again.” </p><p>THAT was all. Dr. Farnum turned to ihe </p><p>detectives: “He is your man,-’ he said, </p><p>“he will be awake in about ten minutes.” </p><p>The trial was not long and Dot was called </p><p>only as a witness. On the advice of her </p><p>man she told the truth and as a state’s wit- </p><p>ness she was given her freedom after the </p><p>trial. A month later Solokoff was eletro- </p><p>cuted, and as ihe body was carried from ihe </p><p>dealh chamber it was delivered into the </p><p>hands of Dr. Farnum who had an ambu- </p><p>lance waiting. </p><p>Otlo and Miss Spence were with Dr. Far- </p><p>num. There was a wild rush and scurry. </p><p>As the body was being carried from the </p><p>death chamber. Dr. Farnuru- leaned over it </p><p>and injected a drug of his own discovery, a </p><p>drug twenty times more powerful than ad-</p><p>renalin which heretofore was the most pow- </p><p>erful of all heart stimulants. </p><p>In the ambulance the doctor and his as- </p><p>854 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>sistants watched the dead man with bated </p><p>breath. The doctor said: “I am afraid we </p><p>have failed.” Then he hurriedly injected </p><p>another dose of the life-giving drug. </p><p>There was a few minutes of soul rending </p><p>anxiety, and suddenly the man once dead re- </p><p>turned to life. He opened his eyes slowly. </p><p>His lungs expanded and he took a deep </p><p>breath. </p><p>Dr. Farnum, who had one hand on that </p><p>of Miss Spence, gripped her until she cried </p><p>out with pain. </p><p>“We have conquered,” he said slowly, </p><p>almost professionally. “I knew 1 was right. </p><p>Electrocution does not really destroy life. </p><p>It merely shocks the heart so that it stops </p><p>beating. And if nothing is done about it, </p><p>of course the body decays. My dose stim- </p><p>ulates the heart to activity again.” And like </p><p>the nurse that she was, the girl replied </p><p>without emotion: </p><p>“It is a success.” </p><p>Otto burst into enthusiastic excited com- </p><p>ments and was sternly silenced by the doc- </p><p>tor. </p><p>“The patient has painful burns where the </p><p>electrodes came in contact with his skin,” </p><p>said Dr. Farnum. “We will have to nurse </p><p>him carefully. He is too valuable to lose </p><p>now that we have resurrected him.” </p><p>For the next few weeks Solokoff was kept </p><p>bound and guarded. Careful nursing had </p><p>resulted in the healing of his wounds and </p><p>Dr. Farnum was ready to perform his great </p><p>experiment. Solokoff aware of what was </p><p>to happen to him, ceased to protest once he </p><p>was assured that he would not be deprived </p><p>of his life. </p><p>Otto and Miss Spence assisted the doctor </p><p>in the operations which extended over a per- </p><p>iod of several weeks. Local and at times </p><p>complete anesthesia were used to relieve as </p><p>much as possible the patient from feeling </p><p>any pain during the actual operations. </p><p>Soothing drugs were administered to help </p><p>him endure his sufferings while the many </p><p>wounds made by the doctor’s instruments</p><p>were healing. </p><p>Dr. Farnum first severed certain nerves, </p><p>causing paralysis of parts of the brain con- </p><p>trolling will and volition. This completed, </p><p>he had a word to say lo Miss Spence who </p><p>had begun to protest against his planned </p><p>procedure. </p><p>“My dear girl,” he said, “humane scrup- </p><p>les are one thing and common sense is an- </p><p>other. This man has been dead. At death </p><p>the soul is supposed to flee the body. If </p><p>this is true our subject is a body without </p><p>a soul. </p><p>"In depriving him of free will, I have </p><p>removed his inborn or acquired criminal </p><p>tendencies. He is harmless to himself and </p><p>what is more important he cannot now go </p><p>about harming others of his fellow men. </p><p>Before I operated he was a menace to so- </p><p>ciety. Now he is harmless, inarticulate, </p><p>inoffensive animal. When 1 am finished </p><p>he will be one-fourth animal and three- </p><p>fourths machine. Under the term of his </p><p>will I have the right to operate and I can’t </p><p>bring myself to sympathize with him. I am </p><p>going ahead. If you care to withdraw </p><p>from the case you may do so and I will </p><p>get another nurse. If you decide to con- </p><p>tinue you will have a chance to learn much. </p><p>You are not so wise that you can afford </p><p>to throw away a chance like this.” </p><p>Miss Spence was in the habit of permit- </p><p>ting Dr. Farnum to decide matters for her </p><p>and so it was in this instance. When they </p><p>were finished Solokoff was a human radio </p><p>set, tuned to receive Hertzian waves at a </p><p>frequency of twenty thousand kilocycles. </p><p>Since Dr. Farnum controlled a portable </p><p>short-wave radio station, licensed to broad- </p><p>cast on this frequency, the experiment stood </p><p>ready for a test. </p><p>For the mechanically inclined, a des- </p><p>cription of this human radio receiver might </p><p>not be amiss. </p><p>On his head, resting like a helmet, was a </p><p>large metal covering, with a space cut away </p><p>for ihe exposure of the Russian's face. </p><p>Resting atop the helmet and giving him a </p><p>satyr-like appearance were two metal rods </p><p>extending about a foot out on either side. </p><p>Around them were hundreds of turns of a</p><p>fine metal wire. The helmet held also a </p><p>number of other queer devices the nature of </p><p>which Farnum did not explain to his lay </p><p>assistants, but to them, the things were suf- </p><p>ficiently awe-inspiring to have an import- </p><p>ant place in the doctor’s plans. </p><p>THE SOULLESS ENTITY </p><p>855 </p><p>Exposed by his open shirt there was a </p><p>dial control, and leading from this there </p><p>began the fine wires that were to send the </p><p>nerve impulses through to his nerve end*. </p><p>If he were undrased he might, with the </p><p>thousands of glistening wires over him. have </p><p>presented the appearance of same strange </p><p>nightmare-like horror; but Farnum with an </p><p>eye to the aesthetic had covered up as much </p><p>of the terrible as possible. </p><p>Between his shoulder blades and extend- </p><p>ing downward almost to the waist was a thin </p><p>metal box containing the other necessary </p><p>parts of the equipment. The power units </p><p>were carried rn his pockets and could be </p><p>hooked up to him when he was finally </p><p>dressed. He was indeed a living breathing </p><p>man-machine, without volition, without a </p><p>thought or desire that was not impressed on </p><p>him by Farnum’s radio broadcaster. Fur- </p><p>thermore if theologians are to be believed, </p><p>he was without a soul. </p><p>To Farnum’s friends, an exclusive </p><p>coterie of savants of high standing, Solokoff, </p><p>the human radio machine, was a scientific </p><p>sensation. He was exhibited to the chosen </p><p>few and allowed to carry out practically all </p><p>the functions of a normal human being but </p><p>only on impulses broadcast by Dr. Far- </p><p>num. </p><p>He was unable to feel pain, joy, des- </p><p>pair or grief—and he could not feel even </p><p>the pangs of hunger. If it were not for the </p><p>fact that he was regularly impelled by Hert- </p><p>zian waves to take nourishment he would </p><p>have starved to death, but without pain or </p><p>without emotion his life depended on the </p><p>batteries, carried in the pockets of his cloth- </p><p>ing and on the will of Dr. Farnum. </p><p>After traveling about the world with his </p><p>strange machine for several years, Dr. Far- </p><p>num, accompanied by Otto and Miss Spence, </p><p>returned to New York. But they had not </p><p>been home a week before dire events, on </p><p>which they had uot reckoned at all, began </p><p>to occur. </p><p>In some manner, probably through a leak </p><p>in the prisons, Dot Borsovich learned that </p><p>her man had been resurrected by Dr. Far- </p><p>num after death in the electric chair.</p><p>Dot had gone from bad to worse and had </p><p>come to be known in the underworld as the </p><p>gorilla woman, because of her cruel and re- </p><p>lentless nature in dealing with victims and </p><p>enemies. </p><p>For months she had been waiting and </p><p>waiting—her whole life set only on the re- </p><p>turn of Dr. Farnum that she might at least </p><p>see and talk to her man. </p><p>On their return, Solokoff was kept in a </p><p>small tiled room over Dr. Farnum’s private </p><p>garage. He was given regular exercise and </p><p>nourishment and was permitted to do small </p><p>tasks such as .washing Dr. Farnum’s cars </p><p>and puttering about the garden. At times </p><p>he was taken out and exhibited to scientists </p><p>upon whom Farnum relied to keep his sec- </p><p>ret. </p><p>The gorilla woman took to hanging about </p><p>the country premises of Dr. Farnum and </p><p>was nol long in learning where her man </p><p>was lodged. By dint of much clever </p><p>scheming she finally made her way into hie </p><p>quarters in the garage, and there ensued a </p><p>scene and a situation without precedent. </p><p>In describing it later to Dr. Farnum and </p><p>Otto, the gorilla woman said: </p><p>“I threw myself in his arms but he was </p><p>blind to me. He paid no attention at all. </p><p>I fell to the floor and grabbed his legs and </p><p>begged him to talk to me and he just didn’t </p><p>seem to know I was there. I climbed up to </p><p>his lips and kissed him and he was as oold </p><p>as if he had been dead. I bflat at his chest </p><p>and he toppled over on a cot and just laid </p><p>there, staring up, his eyes dead and not </p><p>moving. I ran my hands over him and his </p><p>pockets bulged with boxes with wires on </p><p>them. I unbuttoned his vest and shirt and </p><p>he had wires running all over him, but he </p><p>breathed. He was dead and he actually </p><p>breathed. My Gawd, it was awful. I </p><p>screamed out and I guess 1 fainted. When </p><p>I came to my senses I was in a bed and you </p><p>was standing over me.” </p><p>The doctor had found her there in the </p><p>garage. He had carried her into the house </p><p>and had revived her after placing her on </p><p>the bed. Half delirious she had told him</p><p>of her meeting with her man. </p><p>Patiently the doctor told the woman the </p><p>truth. He went into minute details, couch- </p><p>ing his account in simple words.

They awaken to fitid </p><p>themselves in the hands of a colony of human beings </p><p>who are living on the moon. The colony, is presided </p><p>over by a Dr. Forscher u ho is a super-icientist. The </p><p>two explorers are given lo understand that they are </p><p>guests of the colony—whose purpose they cannot dis- </p><p>cover—until they meet and talk with Forscher. The </p><p>colony lives beneath the moon's surface, but by the </p><p>genius of Forscher, they have all the advantages of </p><p>food, sunlight, etc., as they would have on the earth's </p><p>surface. With their guide, a Doctor Langley, the two </p><p>explorers are invited to travel on one. of the cone- </p><p>ships, called tractors, on a lour of inspection of one of </p><p>the airplants whose machinery lias broken down. The </p><p>tractors, they learn, are propelled by synthium, another </p><p>of the products of Dr. Forschers genius. </p><p>856 </p><p>the Moon </p><p>IN THREE PARTS </p><p>PART TWO </p><p>Now go on with the story </p><p>A GONG rang sharply in the engine- </p><p>room. Four attendants took their </p><p>places quickly, each beside a pair of the </p><p>generators. In turn they called a series of </p><p>readings from instruments before them </p><p>through speaking tubes to the pilot house. </p><p>This, Langley told us, was a check on the </p><p>pilot’s instruments. The gong sounded </p><p>twice; the generators slackened their speed, </p><p>and for a second quiet reigned. Then there </p><p>was a hissing from the interior well, which </p><p>rose to a shriek; the tractor quivered, and </p><p>from the increased pressure of my feet on </p><p>the floor I knew we were off. Looking </p><p>through a window at our backs we saw the </p><p>jagged surface of the moon sinking rapidly </p><p>below us. We gained speed upward for </p><p>several seconds; then the hum of the gen- </p><p>erators increased as the rising temperature </p><p>of the synthium was checked. We were </p><p>now traveling upward at some thirty miles </p><p>an hour; it took us but a couple of minutes </p><p>to reach an elevation of a mile or more. </p><p>A new sound directed our attention to </p><p>two great gyroscopes which tilted through </p><p>an angle of thirty degrees, inclining the </p><p>tractor to one side. We now started off </p><p>in this direction, gaining speed constantly </p><p>until, even at our elevation, the ground </p><p>slipped by at an amazing rate. </p><p>Our window was a little off the direct </p><p>line of flight, but we had a good view of </p><p>the patli before us. Many miles ahead we </p><p>caught a glimpse of that tell-tale blue-yel- </p><p>low light from the other tractor, which had </p><p>started off ahead of us. We were rapidly </p><p>overhauling it, gaining speed continually, </p><p>for there was nothing to retard our pro- </p><p>gress and the discharge gave us a constant </p><p>acceleration. Presently we came up with </p><p>the other machine and passed it, spouting </p><p>its trail of glowing gas, a mile or two on </p><p>our left. Its pilot was taking his time, </p><p>having slanted the machine less than ours. </p><p>It dropped back and presently was lost to </p><p>our view. </p><p>Estimating our acceleration, I calculated</p><p>that we were now traveling at nearly seven </p><p>hundred miles per hour. We passed over </p><p>a range of mountains whose tops were </p><p>within a few hundred feet of our elevation, </p><p>and I began speculating as to the conse- </p><p>quence of a collision with them. Perhaps </p><p>the pilot entertained similar thoughts, as </p><p>at this moment the gyroscopes began to </p><p>swing back to vertical. It was mistaken, </p><p>857 </p><p>858 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>however, ae they continued their motion, </p><p>including at an angle of thirty degrees in </p><p>the opposite direction. We must be half- </p><p>way to the mine, and in the absence of </p><p>friction as much energy would be required </p><p>to stop as to reach our preesnt velocity. </p><p>Looking out the window again, we saw </p><p>the ground below us, now tilted at a differ- </p><p>ent angle. It was difficult to dismiss the </p><p>idea that we were </p><p>climbing. By looking </p><p>downward we saw the </p><p>cloud of gas from the </p><p>synthium preceding us </p><p>and ' obscuring the </p><p>ground immediately </p><p>below us. As we con- </p><p>tinued, slackening our </p><p>speed constantly, I </p><p>wondered how a land- </p><p>ing could be made </p><p>with the view thus ob- </p><p>structed. I did not </p><p>wonder long, however, </p><p>so when our velocity </p><p>had been reduced to </p><p>about twenty miles an </p><p>hour the hum of the </p><p>generators rose, the </p><p>roar of the gas became </p><p>less violent, and we </p><p>began to descend. A </p><p>moment later the gy- </p><p>roscopes turned verti- </p><p>cal, and we drifted </p><p>slowly forward under </p><p>momentum, dropping </p><p>rapidly. </p><p>We could now see </p><p>the air-locks to the </p><p>mine, projecting above </p><p>the ground a short dis- </p><p>tance ahead. The rale </p><p>of our fall increased, until it seemed to me </p><p>that the machine must be shattered. The </p><p>ground was alarmingly close; the gas cloud </p><p>had already begun to flatten out along the </p><p>rocky plain. Then, at the last moment, our </p><p>speed was checked and we drifted at a snail’s </p><p>pace a few feet above the ground. The sur- </p><p>face itself was invisible, but its nearness </p><p>could be seen in the behavior of the gas. </p><p>,We descended gently the last few feet land- </p><p>ing with hardly a quiver. </p><p>Langley and Wiley had already begun to </p><p>put on their air-envelopes, and I quickly </p><p>followed suit. It now struck me^ that al- </p><p>though my helmet was sound-proof, the hum </p><p>of the generators was plainly audible. Their </p><p>note was the characteristic whine of elec- </p><p>trical machinery, faithfully reproduced by </p><p>my radio receiver. </p><p>We hurried down </p><p>through the empty </p><p>compartment below </p><p>and onto the surface </p><p>of the moon. The air- </p><p>locks lay a short dis- </p><p>tance before us, and </p><p>the mechanics were </p><p>already on their way </p><p>there. As we ap- </p><p>proached, a crowd of </p><p>men in air envelopes </p><p>came out of the larger </p><p>air-lock, pushing </p><p>wheelbarrows full of </p><p>iron for the colony’s </p><p>foundries. We stood </p><p>by until the loading </p><p>was finished. Mean- </p><p>while the second trac- </p><p>tor appeared, drop- </p><p>ping slowly from the </p><p>inky sky. It nestled </p><p>down near the first, </p><p>which had now receiv- </p><p>ed its cargo and was </p><p>preparing to take off. </p><p>Even at our distance </p><p>the note of the genera- </p><p>tors was quite evident, </p><p>and its lessened vol- </p><p>ume foretold the blind- </p><p>ing rush of gas. It </p><p>rose more and more rapidly to a great </p><p>height; there was the faint rising whine </p><p>of ihe current as it tilted over on its return </p><p>journey. Meanwhile the second tractor had </p><p>taken the men aboard, and it too rose in a </p><p>burst of blue-yellow flames. Higher and </p><p>higher, faster and faster, it went, as if bent </p><p>on overtaking its companion. Its path </p><p>nr HE first installment of \ </p><p>-* this thrilling interplan- </p><p>etary story opened up </p><p>many sources of wonder-</p><p>ment for the reader. What </p><p>is this mysterious Outpost </p><p>on the Moon, hiding away </p><p>from civilization and ful- </p><p>filling some unexplainable </p><p>mission? Are its motives </p><p>beneficial to the earth—or </p><p>is it the agent of some gi- </p><p>gantic attempt to control </p><p>our destinies from the bleak </p><p>surface of our satellite? </p><p>The present, the second </p><p>installment, will reveal the </p><p>secret of many of the events </p><p>that have puzzled. We will </p><p>find out if the Outpost is a </p><p>menace, or if it is itself </p><p>trying, unknown to the </p><p>earth, to contend with some </p><p>force that is directed </p><p>against the earth. The </p><p>secret lies in the gigantic </p><p>brain of the mysterious </p><p>Dr. Forscher, and when he </p><p>speaks there will be set in </p><p>motion a series of astonish- </p><p>ing events that will take us </p><p>to the furthest limits of the </p><p>K^solar system! </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>859 </p><p>through the eky was an irregular, crazy </p><p>corkscrew. </p><p>1 heard Langley mutter, “Why doesn’t the </p><p>fool stranghten out?” Then the generators </p><p>hummed again, faint and low at first, but </p><p>higher and higher as they took up their </p><p>load. Louder, higher, they whined. Langley </p><p>watched, anxiety written in his face. Sud- </p><p>denly they were silent. Langley waved his </p><p>arms, shouting: “He’s overloaded them! He’s </p><p>burned them out! My God, he can’t stop!” </p><p>Fascinated, I watched the machine, grow- </p><p>ing brighter, receding further, climbing in- </p><p>to the pitiless sky. It was a tiny dot now, </p><p>changing color; turning red, then white— </p><p>the color of molten metal! </p><p>I turned away, unable to watch longer. </p><p>Langley muttered, </p><p>“Twenty men, and one </p><p>fool pilot!” </p><p>Slowly we turned to </p><p>the air-lock. The me- </p><p>chanics were huddled </p><p>around the outside, eye- </p><p>ing us, some fearfully, </p><p>some questioning, a few </p><p>defiantly; all no doubt </p><p>mindful of the return </p><p>trip. For my part I was </p><p>half inclined lo risk walk- </p><p>ing back. The tragedy </p><p>had affected us all and </p><p>it was a silent and mor- </p><p>ose group that followed </p><p>Langley to the air plant. </p><p>An Audience </p><p>With Forscher </p><p>A BRIEF inspection was sufficient to de- </p><p>termine the nature of the breakdown. </p><p>A valve leading from the mixer io the stor- </p><p>age tanks had jammed, allowing the fresh- </p><p>ly generated air to escape into the mine, </p><p>while the storage supply also leaked out, </p><p>leaving no reserve. The repairs necessitated </p><p>a complele shutting down of the plant, and </p><p>while this would not have been dangerous </p><p>a* the main colony because of its air-tight </p><p>construction the character of the mining </p><p>operations rendered it risky here. A de-</p><p>posit of iron was being worked, and while </p><p>some of the ore lay on the surface it was </p><p>the practice to sink a shaft beneath the ore </p><p>and work up. It was manifestly impracti- </p><p>cal to give the ore a substantial air-proof </p><p>covering, and the jar of the mining oper- </p><p>ations might open up a crack in the rock </p><p>through which the air would escape. For </p><p>this reason the miners were shut off by an </p><p>air lock, through which they could escape </p><p>to safety in case of an accident. </p><p>The air-making machine was so com- </p><p>pactly built that the dismantling of the </p><p>valve exposed quite a bit of the inner works, </p><p>and we were able to see how it operated. </p><p>On the surface of the moon there lay large </p><p>quantities of quartz, the common dioxide of </p><p>silicon. This was placed in a container in </p><p>the center of which was </p><p>a small piece of synth- </p><p>ium. The tremendous </p><p>heat it generated, proba- </p><p>bly aided by a catalyst, </p><p>liberated the oxygen, </p><p>which escaped upward </p><p>into a cooling tank. The </p><p>residual silicon was sub- </p><p>jected to further heating, </p><p>while a blast of helium </p><p>particles from the radio- </p><p>active synthium passed </p><p>through it and disinte- </p><p>grated each atom of sili- </p><p>con into two of nitrogen. </p><p>The results of this op- </p><p>eration were to con- </p><p>vert silica into equal </p><p>parts of oxygen and </p><p>nitrogen. The oxygen was far in excess of </p><p>the amount required to produce the propor- </p><p>tion of one part oxygen to four of nitrogen </p><p>existing in the air. The remaining oxygen, </p><p>however, went to replenish the supply in </p><p>the atmosphere of the mine, oxygen and ni- </p><p>trogen in normal proportions being mixed </p><p>and stored to compensate leakage. Impur- </p><p>ities in the air, such as carbon dioxide and </p><p>smoke, were removed by well-known pro- </p><p>cesses. </p><p>The task of ..repairing the valve was near- </p><p>ing completion, having occupied the time </p><p>JOSLYN MAXWELL </p><p>860 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>we had spent in examining the machine. </p><p>While the work of reassembling was going </p><p>on Langley notified headquarters that we </p><p>would shortly be ready to return. The </p><p>machine arrived by the time the job was </p><p>finished and was waiting for us. </p><p>The return trip was made without incident </p><p>though each changing sound in the machin- </p><p>ery of the tractor sent shivers up my spine, </p><p>and we arrived in due course at the main </p><p>colony. The news of the loss of the tractor </p><p>had spread rapidly, making a profound ef- </p><p>fect. Throughout the course of my second </p><p>meal in the dining hall it formed the main </p><p>topic of conversation, and led to discussions </p><p>of its probable cause. The men at our ta- </p><p>ble review the possibilities of mechanical </p><p>defects, talked of margins of safety and of </p><p>overloading; while from time to time a </p><p>stray phrase from another table voiced the </p><p>opinion that the machines were unreliable, </p><p>or that the pilot’s recklessness was to blame. </p><p>Langley, who knew more about it than any- </p><p>one present, said nothing. He was sched- </p><p>uled for a conference with Dr. Forscher </p><p>after the meal, and reserved his opinions. </p><p>Finally the gathering broke up into </p><p>groups and sauntered from the dining hall. </p><p>Wiley and I found our way to our quar- </p><p>ters and were grateful for the relaxation of </p><p>comfortable chairs and strong tobacco. We </p><p>remained silent for the most part, for </p><p>though there was much to talk over, it was </p><p>tacitly understood that rest was aL present </p><p>more important. Wiley had had no sleep </p><p>since we reached the establishment of Dr. </p><p>Forscher. and I was still weakened 4/tom the </p><p>offects of my long spell of unconsciousness. </p><p>Our smoke finished, we bade one another </p><p>good-night—Wiley remarking that two </p><p>weeks of darkness would suit him well— </p><p>and in ten minutes I was oblivious of moon, </p><p>earth, and the entire cosmos. </p><p>My watch showed that eight hours had </p><p>passed when the telephone rang sharply. </p><p>Wiley had heard it sooner, and was at the </p><p>instrument when I reached the living-room. </p><p>I could make nothing of his conversation, </p><p>but presently he turned to me with a grin. </p><p>‘The boss is interested in us with a ven- </p><p>geance,v he said. “I’m next on the con-</p><p>ference list, and he wants me in a hurry!” </p><p>He bounded into his bedroom, shouting at </p><p>me as he dressed and shaved. I was astound- </p><p>ed at the speed with which he made himself </p><p>presentable, but the cause of his excitement </p><p>remained a mystery for the time. He pro- </p><p>mised me full details on his return, and was </p><p>off in such a rush as I had not seen for days. </p><p>As I bathed, shaved, and dressed I grad- </p><p>ually came fully awake; my dazed wonder </p><p>at Wiley’s tumultuous departure gave place </p><p>to an intense excitement. I found diversion </p><p>for a time in wheedling some breakfast from </p><p>the chef, a German to whom a breach of </p><p>routine was sacrilege supreme. But, return- </p><p>ing to the apartment, a sense of anticipation </p><p>grew on me. Eagerly 1 awaited Wiley’s </p><p>return, pacing the floor, smoking the air </p><p>blue, wearing ray watch pocket threadbare. </p><p>I tried to read: there was nothing I had not </p><p>thumbed half-a-dozen times. I contemplated </p><p>a trip of exploration, only to dismiss it im- </p><p>mediately for fear of missing Wiley. Min- </p><p>utes dragged. Twelve o’clock became half- </p><p>past; then one; two, three. </p><p>Wiley burst into the room and hit me </p><p>such a thump on the back that I was unable </p><p>to more than gasp, while he exclaimed </p><p>breathlessly: </p><p>“You’re next, old man! Don’t let him </p><p>bluff you! Tell him you know your stuff! </p><p>We’ll have the world by the tail!” And he </p><p>gave me a push that sent me flying into the </p><p>corridor. Shouting a room number after </p><p>me, he slammed the door. </p><p>MORE bewildered than ever, I set out </p><p>in search of the room. It proved to </p><p>&gt; be the office of Dr. Forscher, and I was </p><p>immediately ushered into his presence by a </p><p>silent secretary. </p><p>1 had formed little conception of what </p><p>the man might he like, other than that he </p><p>must possess such an intelligence as I had </p><p>never before encountered. But I was not </p><p>disappointed. From behind a low desk a </p><p>pair of eyes regarded me fixedly—eyes that </p><p>seemed to look through me, to search out </p><p>my very thoughts. They were sheltered by </p><p>shaggy brows, yet seemed to protrude from </p><p>beneath a massive forehead which might </p><p>have contained all the knowledge of the </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>861 </p><p>ages. A fringe of grayish hair, close crop- </p><p>ped, surrounded the dome of his head; </p><p>large, well-formed ears indicated an acute </p><p>sense of hearing. His nose was long, thin, </p><p>and rather out of keeping with the rest of </p><p>his features. A wide mouth, thin lips com- </p><p>pressed into a line indicating determination </p><p>rather than hardness, surmounted a jaw like </p><p>that of the Heidelberg Giant. He spoke in </p><p>a resonant bass which rose from the barrel- </p><p>like chest of his short, squat’body. </p><p>“George Mar land?” he asked. “I had </p><p>not had the pleasure of your acquaintance </p><p>before. However, your colleague, Wiley, </p><p>has told me about you. 1 regre* the slight </p><p>inconvenience to which you were subjected </p><p>a short while ago—” referring to the elec- </p><p>tric spark which had nearly ended my </p><p>career. “We had no knowledge of your in- </p><p>tentions, and thought it best to have the </p><p>first word. I trust you will pardon it. </p><p>“I had intended to allow you to become </p><p>more acquainted with our establishment be- </p><p>fore having this talk with you. Recent de- </p><p>velopments make it imperative, however, </p><p>that wc come to an understanding. </p><p>“No doubt you wonder, as did Mr. Wil- </p><p>ey, why we are here. A fair question: why </p><p>should a group of scientists voluntarily </p><p>give up the comforts of earth for such a </p><p>confined existence as we lead? It will </p><p>take a bit of explaining. Let me say, how- </p><p>ever, that my assistants followed me here </p><p>of their own volition. I only provided the </p><p>opportunity. They, and I, are here solely </p><p>to benefit mankind. </p><p>“The driving ambition of my life has1 </p><p>been the advancement of human welfare. </p><p>I came early to the conclusion that this </p><p>was to be realized only through know- </p><p>ledge; or, as some pul it, science. Hence </p><p>I studied science in all its branches. I </p><p>specialized in none; for with the burning </p><p>ambition of youth, I hoped some day lo </p><p>know all there was to know. I mastered </p><p>the practice of medicine, and its right-hand </p><p>assistant, chemistry. I studied the laws </p><p>and phenomena of physics, mathematics, </p><p>and astronomy. I delved into psychology, </p><p>biology, philosophy, and more.</p><p>“It was while a student al Berlin that the </p><p>first event occurred which led me to my </p><p>present silualion. Looking through my op- </p><p>en window, I saw a meteor fall from the </p><p>sky; not such a meteor as we frequently </p><p>notice on clear fall evenings, but a most </p><p>unusual meteor. While still high in the </p><p>air, it burst into brilliant blue flame and </p><p>scattered into a thousand pieces which hurt- </p><p>led downward, finally disappearing close </p><p>to the ground. Shortly after, the breeze </p><p>brought to my nostrils a faint odor, almost </p><p>indistinguishable, yet unmistakable—the </p><p>odor of burning sulphur. </p><p>“I was so struck with the peculiar behav- </p><p>ior of this meteor that I called it to the at- </p><p>tention of Dr. Steinle, professor of astrono- </p><p>my al Berlin. He agreed with me that the </p><p>phenomenon was unprecedented, and con- </p><p>cluded to ask for reports on it from other </p><p>observers. </p><p>“The results of his inquiries brought </p><p>forth a singular coincidence. No more da- </p><p>ta were forthcoming about our meteor, but </p><p>twenty-nine days before, a meteor behaving </p><p>exactly like it had been observed at San </p><p>Francisco. The two were identical, except </p><p>that the odor of sulphur dioxide had not </p><p>been noticed. Its color, however, was that </p><p>of rapidly burning sulphur. Furthermore, </p><p>it had come from the same section of the </p><p>sky—in ihe plane of ihe ecliptic, on the </p><p>side away from the sun. We now broad- </p><p>cast the description of these two meteors, </p><p>asking for further information regarding </p><p>them or others like them, and set about </p><p>searching the sky in that neighborhood for </p><p>some strange body. </p><p>“Our search brought out another peculiar </p><p>fact. The meteors had been seen for many </p><p>miles around the points where they landed; </p><p>they must have burst into flame almost im- </p><p>mediately on entering the upper atmos- </p><p>phere. Yet, to our knowledge, there was </p><p>not enough oxygen at that altitude to sup- </p><p>port combustion. They must have con- </p><p>tained large quantities of it within them- </p><p>selves to produce such a brilliant flame; </p><p>and indeed, their fierce light suggested com- </p><p>bustion in pure oxygen. </p><p>“However, we were unable to locate any </p><p>possible source of the peculiar bodies. On</p><p>the nights in question, the moon, the stars </p><p>of the constellations Libra, Scorpio, and </p><p>862 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>Sagittarius, and three of the planets — </p><p>Mars, Jupiter and Neptune—occupied that </p><p>part of the heavens, but no comets or other </p><p>strange bodies could be found. </p><p>A Strange Bombardment </p><p>N the fourteenth day after our search </p><p>V-/ began, newspapers from the United </p><p>States reported that a meteor similar to the </p><p>first two had fallen over North Dakota, </p><p>probably in the neighborhood of Devil’s </p><p>Lake. We could find nothing definite </p><p>about the direction from which it had come; </p><p>but twenty-eight day's later we received a </p><p>cablegram from ail amateur astronomer in </p><p>Cairo named Zirkle, reporting a fourth, in </p><p>whose light he had detected the spectrum </p><p>lines of sulphur. </p><p>“The absence of any comet or other source </p><p>of this meteoric shower, together with their </p><p>remarkable composition, began to suggest </p><p>to me some design behind their appearance. </p><p>There was a certain regularity about their </p><p>arrival; the two longer intervals were ex- </p><p>actly double the fourteen-day period (if </p><p>the change of date at the international line </p><p>were taken into account), and it was easy </p><p>to imagine that others might have fallen </p><p>unnoticed to make this period exact. But </p><p>they were obviously not of earthly origin— </p><p>they were too widely distributed. Were </p><p>they, then, the work of intelligent beings </p><p>somewhere out in space? </p><p>“Reasoning from that basis, 1 set out to </p><p>discover, if possible, what sort of beings </p><p>they were, where they might be, and their </p><p>intentions in bombarding the earth. Con- </p><p>sidering the last item I agreed thus: The </p><p>meteors were harmless; they had in no in- </p><p>stance reached the surface of the earth, and </p><p>while sulphur dioxide in sufficient quanti- </p><p>ties is poisonous, the relatively small </p><p>amount which they liberated had no effect </p><p>whatsoever. The brilliant light, however, </p><p>was bound to attract attention, and I be- </p><p>lieved that this was the sole aim of the </p><p>meteors. But why attempt to attract the at- </p><p>tention of us earth-creatures, unless to lead </p><p>us to their source? And who, other than </p><p>beings possessing an intelligence compara- </p><p>ble to our own, would wish to draw atten-</p><p>tion to themselves? </p><p>“Make no mistake; I did not assume they </p><p>were men. Our physical form is merely </p><p>the product of our environment, and with- </p><p>out surroundings paralfeling ours in great </p><p>detail, it is extremely unlikely that the </p><p>process of evolution would have produced </p><p>an animal even generally resembling our- </p><p>selves on another planet. However, they </p><p>must have some things in common with us,- </p><p>To begin with, they were not greatly in- </p><p>ferior to us mentally, nor could they be </p><p>much further advanced than ourselves, else </p><p>they must look on us as lower animals un- </p><p>worthy of attention. </p><p>“Furthermore, their science of chemistry, </p><p>physics, astronomy and psychology must </p><p>be akin lo ours, as was proved by their </p><p>knowledge, or suspicion at least, that in- </p><p>telligent life exists on our planet; their </p><p>ability to direct a meteor, as we fire a gun- </p><p>shot, to a small target across empty space; </p><p>their knowledge of the common meteorite, </p><p>and ability to produce one so totally unlike </p><p>it as to attract attention; and finally the </p><p>expectation that this attention would pro- </p><p>gress from the meteors to themselves. </p><p>Furthermore, they must possess the ability </p><p>to perceive light-vibrations—not necessar- </p><p>ily have eyes, but distinguish the same rays, </p><p>or a part of the same rays, as we; and to </p><p>distinguish one color from another. There </p><p>was, then, considerable ground in common, </p><p>on which we might build a basis for com- </p><p>munication. </p><p>“But to communicate with them, we must </p><p>know their location. Unfortunately, we did </p><p>not know the exact direction from which the </p><p>meteors had come; nor would we have been </p><p>much better off if we had, for the attraction </p><p>of the sun and other members of the solar </p><p>system might have caused them to deviate </p><p>considerably from their original course. </p><p>But by noting the portion of the sky from </p><p>which they appeared, we had computed their </p><p>original direction approximately. Their </p><p>being in the plane of the ecliptic suggested </p><p>the probability that they came from some </p><p>body in the solar system, and this at once </p><p>narrowed the possibilities to Mars, Jupiter, </p><p>Neptune, their satellites, and the asteroids. </p><p>“Having gotten this far, I needed more </p><p>data. Nothing more could be discovered </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>863 </p><p>from the meteors already fallen; closer ob- </p><p>servation of hater ones was necessary. </p><p>“The next meteor somewhat upset ray cal- </p><p>culations, however, arriving on the north- </p><p>western shore of North America three weeks </p><p>later, where it was seen from both Prince </p><p>Rupert, British Columbia, and Juneau, Al- </p><p>aska. The fourtecn-day period was now </p><p>destroyed, but 1 saw almost immediately </p><p>that the intervals were all multiples of sev- </p><p>en days. It might be that my unknown </p><p>creatures had a knowledge of our calendar </p><p>and were timing their shots lo come once </p><p>a week, but it seemed far more likely that </p><p>they were fired at a regularly recurring </p><p>time when the greatest accuracy was pos- </p><p>sible; that is, when some point on their </p><p>planet was in line with the earth. Work- </p><p>ing on this assumption, I plotted the points </p><p>of arrival on a terrestrial globe, and found </p><p>confirmation of my theory. Each location </p><p>pointed to the same spot in the sky; each </p><p>was two, three or four times fifty-six de- </p><p>grees of longitude west of the preceding one; </p><p>and furthermore, supposing that one had </p><p>fallen every seven days, the intermediate </p><p>spots were so little frequented that the fall </p><p>must have gone unrecorded. The interval </p><p>of longitude must correspond to a fraction </p><p>over seven days—a few minutes less than </p><p>four hours, in fact—in which the unknown </p><p>globe completed its orbit. </p><p>“I projected my path of arrival into the </p><p>future, and predicted Lhe arrival of the </p><p>next four. The first two, in Liberia and </p><p>Asia Minor, would probably be missed, but </p><p>the third should be visible from Paris. It </p><p>came three weeks later, bursting almost over </p><p>the city and causing no little excitement. I </p><p>made bold to announce publicly that the </p><p>fourth could be seen from Newfoundland, </p><p>and when the consul at St. John’s reported </p><p>its arrival at two A. M. 1 considered my </p><p>theory established. I had only to name a </p><p>body in the solar system near the point </p><p>from which the meteors had come, which </p><p>completed its orbit in a fraction over seven </p><p>days, and the abode of the beings was </p><p>found. </p><p>“I published my analysis of the data, but </p><p>the scientific world was loalh to place cre- </p><p>dence in the work of an undergraduate</p><p>student. They pointed out that I had over- </p><p>looked the simple fact that life as we know </p><p>it could not exist where I said it did. shrug- </p><p>ged their shoulders, and forgot me. To </p><p>add to my discomfiture, the fall of the met- </p><p>eors abruptly ceased, and my intelligent </p><p>creatures assumed a place alongside the </p><p>fabled engineers of Mars as the creation </p><p>of a mind which saw only what it wanted </p><p>to see. </p><p>CHAPTER VII </p><p>A Gigantic Plan </p><p>&lt;&lt;T WAS amazed at the hail of criticism </p><p>X which fell upon me. I became a nine </p><p>days’ wonder through the efforts of the </p><p>newspapers; I was beseiged by reporters, </p><p>photographers, and the like, seeking inter- </p><p>views the better to deride me pub'licly. In </p><p>short, my life became a veritable hell, and </p><p>I was forced to abandon my studies and </p><p>seek refuge for a time in solitude. </p><p>“My faith in my conclusions was un- </p><p>shaken, but one such experience was </p><p>enough. I resolved never again to mention </p><p>my planet and its inhabitants until I could </p><p>lay before the world unquestionable proofs. </p><p>Henceforth I devoted my life to obtaining </p><p>evidence with which to convince mankind </p><p>that I was right. But how to obtain these </p><p>proofs? I must demonstrate that life was </p><p>possible on my planet, and it seemed as </p><p>though I could never do so. </p><p>“As you know, there are several condi- </p><p>tions which are indispensible to any form </p><p>of life we know. Foremost among these </p><p>is an atmosphere containing a large portion </p><p>of free oxygen. This is equally indispen- </p><p>sible to life in the sea, for it is the pressure </p><p>of the air which prevents the water from </p><p>evaporating entirely, and the fish receive </p><p>their oxygen from that which is dissolved </p><p>in water. It is equally important that the </p><p>climate must be moderate; that is, the tem- </p><p>perature must not be so high as to injure </p><p>the delicate chemical compounds of living </p><p>bodies, nor yet low enough le prevent their </p><p>functioning. Likewise there must be an </p><p>abundance of water, without which the pro- </p><p>cesses of life cannot go on. These condi- </p><p>864 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>lions are not sufficient by themselves, but </p><p>if they are met, in all probability the situa- </p><p>tion will be favorable to the growth and </p><p>development of some form of life. </p><p>‘‘Whether or not they do exist on that </p><p>planet is a question for the telescope and </p><p>the spectroscope. If they are there, their </p><p>presence will be betrayed in the spectra of </p><p>water-vapor, oxygen and carbon-dioxide in </p><p>its atmosphere. </p><p>‘'But accurate spectroscopic measure- </p><p>meants with the instruments then available </p><p>on earth were impossible. The entire plan- </p><p>et could be seen in the largest of telescopes </p><p>only as a minute globe, the size of a pea. </p><p>I wanted to see it a hundred times larger; </p><p>but this would require a telescope with a </p><p>magnifying power of 60,000 to 100,000 dia- </p><p>meters. </p><p>‘'Manifestly this was impossible; even </p><p>though such a tremendous instrument could </p><p>be built, it would be worthless. With the </p><p>telescope then in use, the motion of the air </p><p>was sufficiently magnified so that the heav- </p><p>ens were seen as through a stream of water </p><p>a foot or more deep; the practical limit was </p><p>fast being approached. Unless I could </p><p>find a way to get rid of the disturbing air- </p><p>currents, there was little use in building a </p><p>telescope any larger than that which has no </p><p>doubt been completed for the Kingsley Ob- </p><p>servatory in the United States; and even </p><p>its 200-inch mirror would be hopelessly </p><p>inadequately for my purpose. </p><p>“A solution, fantastic yet intrigu; ig, sug- </p><p>gested itself; and indeed, you must now </p><p>guess our object in being here—in estab- </p><p>lishing this outpost on the moon—is to </p><p>build a telescope, where there is no air, </p><p>where objects weigh only one-sixth as much </p><p>as on earth, where the rotation is much </p><p>slower, where celestial objects are visible </p><p>whether the sun shines or not; where con- </p><p>ditions ideal for astronomical observation </p><p>prevail hour after hour, year after year, </p><p>with no interruption from clouds, winds, or </p><p>what you will. </p><p>“Anything seems easier in retrospect than </p><p>before it is accomplished. I will not bore </p><p>you with the details of my coming; let it</p><p>suffice that I spent forty years seeking the </p><p>means of getting here; that I found it at </p><p>last in my new element, synthium. </p><p>“But to return to the telescope. I men- </p><p>tioned that I would require a magnification </p><p>one hundred times greater than that of any </p><p>telescope used on earth. It is a well-known </p><p>fact that the most efficient eye-piece for </p><p>looking at extended surfaces has an enlarge- </p><p>ment of about twenty-five times for each </p><p>inch of aperture, though greater powers </p><p>are sometimes used. Sir Benjamin Wright </p><p>had, at the time of which I speak, built a </p><p>reflecting telescope one hundred inches </p><p>across; hence his best eyepieces possessed </p><p>powers of enlargement more than 2500 </p><p>times. To give the magnification I wished </p><p>my instrument must then have an aperture </p><p>of four hundred feet! However, there are </p><p>factors which reduce this figure materially. </p><p>To begin with, the earth’s atmosphere ab- </p><p>sorbs six-tenths of the light from the stars; </p><p>here on the moon we get it all. Then, too* </p><p>photographic plates may be used to accu- </p><p>mulate light from faint objects by long </p><p>exposure. In short, a telescope one hun- </p><p>dred feet across would give the results I de- </p><p>sired, if used on the moon. </p><p>“I recruited my little band of scientists </p><p>and my force of laborers, built the tractors, </p><p>and came here, eleven years ago. Eleven </p><p>years is not too much time for the construc- </p><p>tion of so great an instrument; it is just </p><p>nearing completion, and will be ready for </p><p>the great test in a few months. And it will </p><p>stand thereafter, a monument to science, a </p><p>source of invaluable information, long after </p><p>I have seen my theory proven. My only </p><p>regret is that I cannot live as long as it </p><p>lives and see with my own eyes the secrets </p><p>of the heavens unfolded. </p><p>“However, I am an old man; though still </p><p>vigorous I am past seventy, and can hope </p><p>for but a few more years of active life. </p><p>Yet the work I have begun must go on; </p><p>the greatest benefactors of humanity are </p><p>those men who have given lo succeeding </p><p>generations better tools with which to add </p><p>to their store of knowledge. And so it is </p><p>lhat I now seek a successor, to begin where </p><p>I must leave off. </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>865 </p><p>«rpHIS successor must be an exceptional </p><p>I. person. He must be a trained scien- </p><p>tist of the highest order; must be possessed </p><p>of a brilliant mentality, great courage, and </p><p>the ability to endure hardships; and above </p><p>all he must have the patience, the endur- </p><p>ance, to devote his life to his work, as I </p><p>have done. </p><p>"I say, without egotism but as a statement </p><p>of fact, that I know of no one man who </p><p>possesses all these requirements. There </p><p>are many who have a few, some who poss- </p><p>ess most of them; but none who can lake </p><p>over all of the responsibilities which must </p><p>be assumed. Therefore, 1 have decided to </p><p>pass on the management of this colony to a </p><p>group of men. who, taken together, have all </p><p>these qualities. </p><p>“Your colleague Wiley is a remarkable </p><p>man; 1 hold him in the utmost respect. </p><p>His attainments in the field of physics sur- </p><p>pass my own in some respects. He is </p><p>young, vigorous, brave to the point of reck- </p><p>lessness; a man suited in many ways to un- </p><p>dertake the task of carrying on my work. </p><p>But unfortunately he is not an astronomer, </p><p>and after all it is in that field that the great- </p><p>est good will come from this outpost of </p><p>science. Nevertheless, as a lieutenant to an </p><p>able astronomer, Wiley will be invaluable. </p><p>1	have suggested it to him, and he is most</p><p>enthusiastic. </p><p>“With him will be Dr. Langley, a hard- </p><p>headed, practical engineer, who will be a </p><p>useful counterbalance to Wiley’s impetuo- </p><p>sity. These two, and a third, will be the </p><p>leaders of this colony when I retire. </p><p>“The third man will be an astronomer. </p><p>He is not here; he knows nothing of this </p><p>enterprise. In fact, I do not know yet who </p><p>he will be. 1 have considered the men on </p><p>earth whose ability I know, and have se- </p><p>lected from them three possibilities. All </p><p>were men of promise when I knew them; </p><p>any of them is capable of doing the astrono- </p><p>mical work. But I know little of them per- </p><p>sonally. Before I select one of them I must </p><p>know whether he possesses the qualities I </p><p>have mentioned, and whether he is in a posi- </p><p>tion to abandon the earlh for such a life</p><p>as we lead here. </p><p>“I cannot go personally to interview these </p><p>men. I shall send someone who can take </p><p>months, if necessary, to become personally </p><p>acquainted with them, and sound them out </p><p>before making any proposition. It will re- </p><p>quire diplomacy, patience, and resourceful- </p><p>ness. Moreover it will require an up-to- </p><p>date knowledge of the events of the world. </p><p>“I should also like to maintain more or </p><p>less regular contact with ihe earth hereafter, </p><p>for various reasons. I need more laborers; </p><p>there are doubtless scientific developments </p><p>which should prove useful to me: and from </p><p>time to time 1 shall want materials which </p><p>are not readily procurable here. </p><p>"1 have taken an hour of your time and </p><p>mine to lay before you in some detail our </p><p>situation, so that you may be prepared to </p><p>answer the question I wish to ask you. It </p><p>is ihis: Are you willing to be my inter- </p><p>mediary between the moon and the earth?” </p><p>I	had come for this interview expecting</p><p>almost anything; yet I was utterly dum- </p><p>founded at the doctor’s last words. I con- </p><p>trolled an impulse to question my ability, </p><p>for 1 paid him the compliment of knowing </p><p>men, and I felt sure that he would never </p><p>have offered me the post without first mak- </p><p>ing sure of my qualifications. Therefore I </p><p>collected my thoughts and considered for a </p><p>moment. I had no reason ever to return </p><p>permanently to the earlh, and if Wiley was </p><p>to remain here and eventually come inlo a </p><p>controlling position, there was every incen- </p><p>tive for me to remain and see the thing </p><p>through. </p><p>The doctor was sitting patiently awaiting </p><p>my reply. His face was expressionless, yet </p><p>those piercing eyes of his seemed to pene- </p><p>trate inlo my mind and expose ihe thoughts </p><p>there. He smiled slightly, e^ven before I </p><p>spoke, as though he had already read the </p><p>words which came: </p><p>“I shall be very glad to accept!” </p><p>II	was some forty-eight hours later than</p><p>Wiley and I had our first glimpse of the </p><p>nearly-completed telescope. It was truly </p><p>a monstrous thing. Build on the reflecting </p><p>principle (since it is easier to make large</p><p>mirrors of perfect figure than lenses of like </p><p>dimensions), il measured one hundred feet </p><p>across, and fully six hundred to the top of </p><p>the “tube”, which was a criss-cross frame- </p><p>866 </p><p>WONDER </p><p>STORIES </p><p>work of steel girders built to support the </p><p>smaller mirror which deflected the beam </p><p>of light toward its focus on the side of the </p><p>instrument. On this tube was also a small </p><p>platform on which the photographic appara- </p><p>tus was mounted, and which could be used </p><p>for direct observation if desirable. </p><p>The instrument was housed in a dome </p><p>similar to that of the ordinary terrestrial </p><p>observatory, save that it was insulated </p><p>against heat and equipped with an appara- </p><p>tus to maintain the temperature within a </p><p>small range. This eliminated all deforma- </p><p>tion and possible cracking of the mirror due </p><p>to heat and cold. The observatory was lo- </p><p>cated exactly at the lunar equator, so that </p><p>every star in the firmament was visible at </p><p>some time or other. The twenty-eight day </p><p>period of the moon made possible much </p><p>longer single periods of observation of one# </p><p>body than on earth, where the duration of </p><p>the night and changing conditions of weath- </p><p>er often made it nccessary in photographing </p><p>faint objects to expose the same plate on </p><p>several nights. </p><p>As I stood at the base of this greatest </p><p>of scientific instruments, I sensed some of </p><p>the gratification that the man who .had made </p><p>.it possible must feel. I no longer wonder- </p><p>ed that he could shut himself away for so </p><p>long a time, for I was becoming imbued </p><p>with the enthusiasm that all these men here </p><p>must feel, knowing that some day soon this </p><p>great inquisitive eye would be turned on </p><p>the heavens to search out its greatest secret </p><p>—the whereabouts of other equally intelli- </p><p>gent and curious creatures. Although real- </p><p>izing full well that it was a matter of months </p><p>to the completion of the telescope, and af- </p><p>ter that many more months of careful re- </p><p>search work before the theories of Dr. For- </p><p>scher could be proven or discredited, nev- </p><p>ertheless, as I stood near the axis of the </p><p>cradle which held that hundred foot mirror, </p><p>a feeling of restlessness, of expectation, came </p><p>over me. I could not help but feel that </p><p>we were on the verge of some great event; </p><p>that the story which the telescope was soon </p><p>to tell would be not only the answer to a </p><p>question for which a great man had spent </p><p>his life, but the beginning of a new era in</p><p>science and the history of mankind. </p><p>On Earth Again! </p><p>MY opportunities to watch the progress </p><p>of the construction were few, however. </p><p>I	set to work at once to master the running</p><p>of the synthium tractors. For days I rode </p><p>in the pilot house, silently watching the </p><p>man at the helm as he sent the machine </p><p>hurtling above the ground at terrific speeds; </p><p>later I guided its course with my own hands </p><p>under his watchful eye. I circumnavigated </p><p>the whole moon in less than a day, seeing </p><p>the rocky plains and jagged peaks of the </p><p>hemisphere which had been forever hidden </p><p>from my earthbound fellows, taking short </p><p>jaunts directly away from the ground into </p><p>the weird, mottled sky. </p><p>At length my instructor pronounced me </p><p>competent to start out for the earth in search </p><p>of an astronomer to collaborate with Dr. </p><p>Forscher and complete the controlling tri- </p><p>umvirate which was to succeed him. Time </p><p>had passed quickly in our little underground </p><p>world; 1 could hardly believe that six </p><p>weeks had passed since my arrival. But </p><p>the hour was at hand when 1 must return to </p><p>my native planet. Dr. Forscher, Wiley and </p><p>a few others were on hand to see me off, </p><p>and after a brief exchange of farewells I </p><p>climbed aboard with a small crew of en- </p><p>gineers and a relief pilot. </p><p>The journey took only about two days, </p><p>and there was little novelty in it. Once </p><p>free of the moon’s attraction we cut down </p><p>the force of the discharging gas so that </p><p>we gained speed at the rate of only one- </p><p>sixth of a foot per second, each second; yet </p><p>at the end of twenty-four hours we were </p><p>shooting through space at the terrific pace </p><p>of over 14,000 feet per second—better than </p><p>a hundred and fifty miles a minute. The </p><p>telescope in the pilot house occasionally </p><p>picked up a tiny dot of light that revealed </p><p>itself as a chunk of meteoric rock, and only </p><p>a quick shift of the gyroscopes saved our </p><p>rocketing tractor from being split from top </p><p>to bottom. </p><p>We turned its base toward the earth and </p><p>began to slow down. We must travel blind </p><p>now, yet we were safe. The fierce blast of </p><p>gas from the driving synthium blew ob- </p><p>structions from our path like chips in a</p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>867 </p><p>hurricane, leaving us nothing to do but </p><p>make plans for our sojourn on the earth. </p><p>At length we sighted the rim of its night- </p><p>shrouded face stretching away beneath us. </p><p>Our speed was reduced to a hundred miles </p><p>an hour—a snail'a pace to us—and we drop- </p><p>ped into the rare layer of hydrogen which </p><p>marks the upper limit of the atmosphere. </p><p>Below us was the gentle sheen of the At- </p><p>lantic, glimmering in the pale light of the </p><p>moon— a moon which had inspired volumes </p><p>of poetry. Distance indeed lent enchant- </p><p>ment to its jagged, blazing face. </p><p>Our immediate destination was the City </p><p>College. Accordingly 1 turned the tractor </p><p>westward, and at a now constant velocity </p><p>we sped across the ocean. Day was break- </p><p>ing when we dropped gently to earth on the </p><p>outskirts of the great city 1 had left less </p><p>than two months before. </p><p>Two months! Was it possible that in </p><p>so short a space of time my life could have </p><p>changed so radically, so strangely? It </p><p>seemed ages since I had said goodbye to a </p><p>little group of scholars near the spot where </p><p>we now rested. And how much more </p><p>strongly must these sentiments have affected </p><p>the others of the party, who had not trod </p><p>the earth, seen trees and grass, nor watched </p><p>the coming of the day in a dozen years! </p><p>We burst forth reeling and stumbling </p><p>like drunken men, so unused were we to the </p><p>strong pull of gravity. The tractor lay off </p><p>the traveled highways, so we fastened its </p><p>outer door with little fear lhat it would be </p><p>molested. I led the way to a trolley line </p><p>half a mile distant, thanking Wiley's fore- </p><p>sight in taking along a fair sum of Ameri- </p><p>can money for our return. Dr. Forscher </p><p>had provided a quantity of gold bullion to </p><p>defray my expenses, but I could imagine </p><p>the astonishment of a trolley-car conductor </p><p>on being offered a ten kilogram bar as fare. </p><p>We left the trolley at a down-town ho- </p><p>tel, where I engaged rooms for the others. </p><p>Then, after a hasty breakfast, we set out </p><p>in search of presentable clothes, for those </p><p>we had worn on the moon were designed for </p><p>service alone. My credit was still good, </p><p>and we presently sauntered forth in unim-</p><p>peachable garments. </p><p>I promised to arrange for living expen- </p><p>ses for the crew for a couple of months, </p><p>and bade them goodbye for the present af- </p><p>ter exacting solemn promises to keep in </p><p>touch with me and to be on hand for the </p><p>return trip. They set off ere masse in search </p><p>of excitement, and 1 headed for the City </p><p>College alone. </p><p>Dr. Willson had not yet arrived when </p><p>I reached the Physics Building. His sec- </p><p>retary ushered me into his private office, </p><p>where I made myself at home. 1 had not </p><p>been waiting long when he entered, stopping </p><p>in his tracks as if facing a ghost. </p><p>“Marland!” he exclaimed. “We had </p><p>given you up for dead! When did you gel </p><p>back? Where’s Wiley?” His questions </p><p>rushed in a torrent. </p><p>1 answered the last. </p><p>“Up there,” I said, indicating vaguely. </p><p>“On the moon?” He demanded. “He </p><p>isn’t—?” </p><p>“No,” I returned. “Alive and well, and </p><p>among friends.” </p><p>E apparently thought me demented, and </p><p>I added, “It's a long story, but I’ll tell </p><p>you about it.” </p><p>I recounted briefly the facts of our being </p><p>picked up by the lunar colony, of the re- </p><p>markable works of science which had been </p><p>done there, and of Dr. Forscher’s purpose. </p><p>When I reached this point Dr. Willson in- </p><p>terrupted. </p><p>“What planet is this that he believes sup- </p><p>ports life?” he asked. </p><p>“lie didn't name it,” I said, “but 1 can </p><p>hazard a guess. He described it as being </p><p>al a great distance from the earth and hav- </p><p>ing a period of seven days and four hours </p><p>or a little less.” </p><p>“That doesn’t sound like a planet,” com- </p><p>mented Dr. Willson. “More likely one of </p><p>the satellites—Saturn's, or Jupiter’s.” </p><p>“Ganymede,” I affirmed. “The third of</p><p>the satellites discovered by Galileo. It’s </p><p>period is seven days, three hours and forty- </p><p>odd minutes. About 3,300 miles in dia- </p><p>meter—quite a fair-sized world.” </p><p>“But life there isn’t possible!” he pro- </p><p>tested. “The sun gives it only l-27th as </p><p>much heat as the earth receives. Measure- </p><p>means have been made to show that the sur- </p><p>868 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>face temperature is 140 degrees* below </p><p>zero.” </p><p>“Dr. Forscher does not contest that,” I </p><p>replied. “He merely states that the evi- </p><p>dence of the meteors is conclusive. How- </p><p>ever, the question will be settled soon.” </p><p>And I went on to explain my present mis- </p><p>sion. </p><p>“And you’re to find the astronomer, eh?” </p><p>commented Dr. Willson. “Did he specify </p><p>anyone?” </p><p>“He named three for me to choose be- </p><p>tween,” I replied. “Though I haven't any </p><p>idea where to find them now. That was </p><p>[one object in coming here—I thought per- </p><p>haps you might help me.” </p><p>“I’ll be glad to,” he agreed. “Who are </p><p>jthey? I'll get in touch with the Astronomy </p><p>(Department—they’d be most apt to know.” </p><p>The names of the men were in a letter </p><p>among the other documents I had brought </p><p>with me. After a moment’s search I found </p><p>them. </p><p>“Bradley, Rondeau and Quaile,” I said </p><p>“Bradley took his degree at Chicago, and </p><p>was with the Lick Observatory for awhile. </p><p>Rondeau was at Paris, and Quaile at Green- </p><p>wich, I believe. But that was twelve years </p><p>ago; there’s no telling where they are now, </p><p>of course.” </p><p>“No,” he agreed, “but I’ll see if Radner </p><p>knows anything of them.” </p><p>He turned to his phone, and was con- </p><p>nected with the Astronomy Department. </p><p>After a few minutes’ conversation, he re- </p><p>ported : </p><p>“Bradley is in Africa, getting ready for </p><p>the next solar eclipse. He’s in charge of </p><p>an expedition somewhere in the Jungle, </p><p>and it would take months to reach him. </p><p>Rondeau died in 1924—pneumonia. They </p><p>say he would have been a great man. too'; </p><p>it's a pity. Thornton Quaile is in this </p><p>country. At Flagstaff, in fact, doing re- </p><p>search on the planets.” He paused sudden-</p><p>ly. “By the way, did you know—or of </p><p>course you don’t—that he has published a </p><p>book recently on the conditions of the plan- </p><p>ets? He’s become quite an authority on the </p><p>Solar System. He’d be a good man to look </p><p>up, I’d say.” </p><p>‘Centigrade scale:—220‘ Fahrenheit. </p><p>“I’d like to read the book.” I declared. </p><p>“Have you a copy of it at the College?” </p><p>“At the library.’" </p><p>“I’ll go there immediately,” 1 said. “Much </p><p>obliged for your assistance.” </p><p>“Be sure and keep in touch with me until </p><p>you go,” he said. </p><p>“Of course.” </p><p>At the library I obtained a copy of </p><p>Thornton Quaile’s treatise, “Life on Other </p><p>Planets,” and settled down to peruse it. </p><p>The author tried to point out the folly of </p><p>definite assertions about the matter. Re- </p><p>ferring to Mars, he observed that the pop- </p><p>ular theory of its “canals” must stand or </p><p>fall on the question of whether its atmos- </p><p>phere contained water and oxygen; for </p><p>without water vapor in the air there could </p><p>evidently be none on the ground, and with- </p><p>out oxygen no life could exist. Then he </p><p>presented contrasting results obtained by </p><p>different observers who had tried to settle </p><p>that question without success. </p><p>“The very fact that we can live on the </p><p>earth interferes with our attempts to find </p><p>out about other worlds,” said the book. </p><p>“In taking pictures of the spectrum of Mars, </p><p>in which the dark lines of oxygen and water </p><p>appear, we are also photographing the air </p><p>above us which contains these same lines. </p><p>We can only guess how much of the spec- </p><p>trum on our plates belongs to Mars and </p><p>how much to the earth. The water band, </p><p>particularly, is subject to wide changes in </p><p>a few hours, when.a shift in the wind brings </p><p>quantities of moisture to the air above us. </p><p>Thus in the same night photographs may </p><p>give results which differ by two or three </p><p>hundred percent.” </p><p>In a later chapter I found: “Venus, too, </p><p>guards her secrets as closely as the Queen </p><p>of Beauty for whom she is named. Two </p><p>capable astronomers may point their teles-</p><p>copes at her clouded face. One announces </p><p>that the length of her day is twenty-three </p><p>hours; the other says six weeks.” </p><p>“In the face of such conflicting data,” the </p><p>book summed up, “who are we to say there </p><p>is, or there is not life elsewhere in the solar </p><p>system? If you were to ask nje: ‘how shall </p><p>we find out?’ I should reply ‘let us take </p><p>our telescopes somewhere where there is no </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>869 </p><p>air to annoy us; or better still, let us go and </p><p>see for ourselves!’” </p><p>1 closed the book and sat wrapped in </p><p>pleasant thought. Unless I was greatly mis- </p><p>taken Thornton Quaile’s wish would soon </p><p>be fulfilled. </p><p>CHAPTER VIII. </p><p>Quaile. </p><p>I left the City College about noon, and </p><p>hiring an auto, drove alone to the rest- </p><p>ing-place of the tractor. The last mile or </p><p>so was over a bumpy cart-track, almost </p><p>unused; and it was not easy to drive the </p><p>car to the tractor’s base. I set about remov- </p><p>ing my few belongings to the auto, together </p><p>with the gold which was to defray my ex- </p><p>penses. This last was a job which taxed my </p><p>strength to the limit, but finally it was </p><p>done, and I returned to the city. Here 1 de- </p><p>posited the gold at a bank, purchased a </p><p>suitcase and some more clothes, and bought </p><p>a railroad ticket to Flagstaff, Arizona. </p><p>The journey was long and monotonous. </p><p>I bought a periodical from the news butcher </p><p>and read until the jiggling print made my </p><p>eyes smart. After a dinner of under-done </p><p>beefsteak in the diner, I wandered back </p><p>to the observation platform and watched </p><p>the rails chase each other into the distance. </p><p>As darkness fell 1 grew drowsy and pres- </p><p>ently fell asleep. </p><p>1 imagined I was Hoating through space </p><p>above a tiny world, no larger than a pea. </p><p>It grew in size to a globe just big enough </p><p>to stand on, and I set one foot gingerly on </p><p>its surface. Then I became aware of an- </p><p>other man standing before me. He was try- </p><p>ing to communicate with me, as I could see </p><p>from his gestures, but I could make nothing </p><p>of them. At length, angered at my stupidity, </p><p>he picked up an enormous ball of glowing </p><p>sulphur and hurled it in my face where it </p><p>burst with a terrific roar. I awoke to find </p><p>a Switch engine coupled to the rear of the </p><p>train, its headlight illuminating the plat- </p><p>form. </p><p>The other chairs were deserted except for </p><p>the one next to mine, where there sat one</p><p>of those talkative travelers who are always </p><p>ready to start a conversation, given the </p><p>slightest opportunity. He was somewhat </p><p>amused at my startled awakening. </p><p>“Where you going, friend?” he roared </p><p>above the exhaust of the locomotive. </p><p>“Ganymede!” I roared back. </p><p>“Never heard of it!” he shouted. “Little </p><p>place?” </p><p>“Bigger than North America,” I an- </p><p>swered. He looked at me, puzzled; then, </p><p>apparently thinking I was trying to make </p><p>a fool of him, he arose in a huff and went </p><p>inside. 1 followed after a few minutes, and </p><p>finding my berLh made up I went to bed. </p><p>During the next day I speculated as to </p><p>how I should approach Quaile in order to </p><p>gain his confidence without disclosing my </p><p>object. At length I decided to represent </p><p>myself as an amateur astronomer and lead </p><p>him into conversation about life on the </p><p>planets. </p><p>After a change of trains I arrived at Flag- </p><p>staff on the third day, and set out at once </p><p>to locate Quaile. The observatory was some </p><p>distance from the town, and it was well af- </p><p>ter dark when 1 arrived there. The big tele- </p><p>scope was already pointed to the heavens, </p><p>where Mars was visible in the western </p><p>sky. Quaile was not in the observatory dome, </p><p>however, I found him with a fellow-scien- </p><p>tist, puffing an enormous pipe and discus- </p><p>sing the respective merits of refracting and </p><p>reflecting telescopes. His accent stamped </p><p>him at once as a Britisher. He was about </p><p>average height, partly bald, and wore a tiny </p><p>blonde moustache. I judged he had recent- </p><p>ly turned forty. He was a jolly, lively per- </p><p>son. and I felt at once that 1 liked him. </p><p>“Y’see,” he was saying, “They can’t make </p><p>these lenses big enough. Give me the re- </p><p>flectors—they get so much more light from </p><p>the planets. Now, if I could just take that </p><p>big fellow at Mount Wilson up about fifty </p><p>miles where there’s no air, I’d show you </p><p>some jolly good photographs.” </p><p>1	fell an impulse to tell him that his wish</p><p>would be more than granted il he went with </p><p>me to the moon; but I must not be too</p><p>hasty. 1 apologized for interrupting their </p><p>conversation, and introduced myself. The </p><p>other man excused himself, saying he had </p><p>work to do. Quaile seemed surprised that. </p><p>870 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>I should come all the way to Arizona mere- </p><p>ly to talk with him, and not a little pleased </p><p>that I considered him the foremost authority </p><p>on the planets. I told him that I had a the- </p><p>ory regarding one of Jupiter’s satellites, and </p><p>would like to talk it over with him when he </p><p>had the time. </p><p>«V[ 0 time like the present,” he said </p><p>11	promptly. “Let's make ourselves</p><p>comfortable, and you tell me about it.” He </p><p>settled back in his chair, still puffiing his </p><p>huge pipe, and listened with interest as I </p><p>explained that I believed Ganymede might </p><p>be the abode of life. I suggested that the </p><p>satellite might receive enough heat from </p><p>Jupiter to make it habitable; but I was </p><p>forced to omit Dr. Forscher’s most convinc- </p><p>ing arguments, and my reasons lacked force. </p><p>Instead of laughing at me, however, he </p><p>heard me through. When I had finished, he </p><p>explained the opinion of present day astron- </p><p>omers. </p><p>“Y'see,” he said, “there have been a few </p><p>measurements of Jupiter’s temperature, </p><p>which indicate that it’s pretty cold there— </p><p>say a hundred and forty Centigrade below </p><p>zero. There’s nothing in the way of plant </p><p>or animal life that could live al such a tem- </p><p>perature. We don't know of any reason why </p><p>the satellites should be warmer, so that just </p><p>about lets out the possibility of men being </p><p>there.” </p><p>However, my insistence on the point </p><p>aroused a spark of interest in his mind, and </p><p>he suggested that I stay around until the </p><p>present series of measurements on Mars </p><p>were finished.. By that time Jupiter would </p><p>be in a favorable position for observation </p><p>early in the mornings, and he promised to </p><p>try to find out something about Ganymede. </p><p>I found accommodations in Flagstaff, and </p><p>spent much time in Quaile’s company. He </p><p>was passionately devoted to his work, and </p><p>had no other interest except music. He was </p><p>a capable performer on the violin, and of- </p><p>ten whiled away his leisure hours enter- </p><p>taining small audiences with the dreamy </p><p>tones from his skillful bow. 1 secretly re- </p><p>joiced to learn that he had no family ties, </p><p>since this removed the greatest obstacle lo</p><p>his going to the moon. I found him an </p><p>excellent fellow, and enjoyed spending hours </p><p>with him at the observatory as he sat at </p><p>the eyepiece of the telescope, motionless as </p><p>a statue, following the path of the “Red </p><p>Planet” across the firmament. We ex- </p><p>changed few words during such times, yet </p><p>a considerable friendship grew up between </p><p>us. I bided my time, waiting for an oppor- </p><p>tunity lo broach the subject uppermost in </p><p>my mind. </p><p>It came one night a month or so later. </p><p>The spectroscopic work on Mars was sus- </p><p>pended for the time being, and we went one </p><p>night to the observatory to train the tele- </p><p>scope on Jupiter and his satellites. The </p><p>planet did not rise until two o’clock in the </p><p>morning, and was still low on the horizon </p><p>when we turned the dome to the eastward </p><p>and focussed the eyepiece. In the field of </p><p>view we could see the disc of the great </p><p>planet, streaked with belts about the middle. </p><p>Near one edge was a grayish blot, the rem- </p><p>nant of the “Great Red Spot” which caused </p><p>much comment among astronomers half a </p><p>century ago. </p><p>Scattered across the field like so many </p><p>stars save for their slightly greater size, </p><p>were three dots of light, one almost touch- </p><p>ing the planet’s edge, the others farther </p><p>away on the opposite side. These were Eu- </p><p>ropa, Ganymede, and Callisto—the second, </p><p>third, and fourth of the satellites first seen </p><p>by Galileo in the early seventeenth century. </p><p>Io, the first, was eclipsed by Jupiter’s great </p><p>shadow. </p><p>We brought Ganymede to the center of </p><p>the field and applied a higher-powered eye- </p><p>piece. It now appeared about the size of a </p><p>large buck-shot, a tiny disc of light which </p><p>wavered slightly, swelled and contracted, </p><p>as the trembling atmosphere above us dis- </p><p>torted the beam of light that reached the </p><p>great lens. We could see nothing of its </p><p>surface characteristics: it was like looking </p><p>al the entire map of Asia drawn on a pea. </p><p>I imagined looking at it through Dr. For- </p><p>scher’s giant telescope, making it appear a </p><p>hundred times larger. What would we see </p><p>then—oceans and continents, clouds, or a </p><p>barren waste of ice? </p><p>•Any laree telescope sliows ihe stars as small</p><p>discs, due lo diffraction. </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>871 </p><p>I resigned the eyepiece to Quaile, and he </p><p>peered through it intently for a moment. </p><p>Then he shook his head with a sigh. </p><p>“Bad seeing,” he said. “The thing jumps </p><p>around like a cricket.” He climbed down </p><p>from the observer’s station on the step-lad- </p><p>der beneath the telescope. “Y’know,” he </p><p>observed, “If we could find a way to get </p><p>rid of that motion we’d be able to find out </p><p>a lot more than we can now. It’s bad to- </p><p>night, but it’s always there.” </p><p>Quaile Decides. </p><p>I DECIDED to spring my proposition. </p><p>“When I first saw you,” 1 began, </p><p>“You were saying that you’d like to take </p><p>the Mount Wilson telescope up above the </p><p>atmosphere.” He smiled. I drew a breath </p><p>and plunged ahead. “What would you say </p><p>if I told you where there was a bigger tele- </p><p>scope on solid ground, with no air above it </p><p>at all?” </p><p>“You mean, someone’s put one on top of </p><p>Mount Everest?” he asked, puzzled. </p><p>“Better than that,” 1 replied. “There’s </p><p>a telescope ready for use now, waiting for </p><p>the man to handle it, that would make a </p><p>dozen of the Mount Wilson reflector.” </p><p>“Y’know, you interest me,” he said. “Go </p><p>on.” </p><p>“The mirror of this telescope is one hun- </p><p>dred feet in diameter,” I said. “It can be </p><p>used with eyepieces magnifying up to 100,- </p><p>000	diameters. And there’s absolutely no</p><p>atmosphere around it." </p><p>“Where?” he demanded. </p><p>“On the moon,” I said. </p><p>“Oh, I say now,” he exploded. “It’s all </p><p>very well to joke, but you carry it a bit </p><p>far.” </p><p>“No joking about this,” I said, “And you </p><p>needn’t have any fears as to my sanity. I </p><p>can prove every word I say. I’ve seen that </p><p>telescope with my own eyes; and there are</p><p>men within our reach who will back up my </p><p>statements. Say the word, and I’ll lake you </p><p>there. In fact, that’s the reason I’m here!” </p><p>Quaile was thunderstruck, naturally </p><p>enough. He pulled out his handkerchief </p><p>and wiped his forehead. </p><p>“Well!” he said, and again, “Well!” </p><p>After a moment he asked, “But bow the devil </p><p>does one get to the moon?” </p><p>“Two men have done it independently </p><p>by different means,” I replied. “I can take </p><p>you there—if you’re interested.” </p><p>“Interested? Well, rather. But y’know, </p><p>it’s somewhat of a knock, all this about a </p><p>telescope on the moon, and men going </p><p>there. How can one live there, without any </p><p>air?” </p><p>“There are several hundred men living </p><p>there now,” I said, “Making their own air.” </p><p>This was the last straw for Quaile. I saw </p><p>that he regarded me as a raving maniac. </p><p>“Yes, of course, old fellow,” he said pla- </p><p>catingly. “But let’s not bother with it. </p><p>What say to a cup of tea, and we turn in?” </p><p>“It suits me,” I agreed. “But do me a </p><p>favor. Perhaps you’ve heard of Dr. Will- </p><p>son, the physicist?” He nodded. “Send </p><p>him a wire—ask him whether my story is </p><p>true.” </p><p>Quaile seemed doubtful, but I pressed </p><p>him, and finally he agreed to do as 1 asked. </p><p>I accompanied him lo the telegraph office </p><p>where he dispatched a wire to Dr. Willson, </p><p>asking for a prompt reply. Then he went </p><p>to bed, for the day was breaking, and the </p><p>astronomer, like the owl, seeks his home </p><p>during ihe daylight hours. </p><p>When we awoke the following afternoon, </p><p>Dr. Willson’s telegram was at the observa- </p><p>tory : </p><p>, “MARLAND’S STORY REGARDING </p><p>TELESCOPE UNDOUBTEDLY TRUE </p><p>STOP HE HAS MY COMPLETE CON- </p><p>FIDENCE—WILLSON” </p><p>Quaile was impressed, but I saw that he</p><p>still regarded the affair as a hoax. Nev- </p><p>ertheless I followed up my advantage. </p><p>“If 1 can show you a machine which will </p><p>take us to the moon, will you go with me?” </p><p>I asked. </p><p>“Seems like a fair proposition,” he as- </p><p>sented. “You won't mind, of course, if we </p><p>don’t say anything about this to the men </p><p>here?” </p><p>“Not at all,” I assured him. Obviously </p><p>he did not want to be made a laughing- </p><p>stock in case this should turn out to be a </p><p>fool’s errand. </p><p>872 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>WE packed our baggage and took the </p><p>train east a few days later. Quaile </p><p>was a jolly traveling companion, and de- </p><p>spite his not entirely unjust suspicion of </p><p>me, the trip was enjoyable. However, as </p><p>we neared our destination, a doubt assailed </p><p>me. During the entire month of my sojourn </p><p>at Flagstaff I had not heard a word from </p><p>the crew of the tractor. What if they had </p><p>deserted me? I could not very well manage </p><p>the machine alone for the return journey, </p><p>and I could not find another crew. With </p><p>this in mind, I set out at once for the spot </p><p>where I had left the machine, Quaile going </p><p>with me. </p><p>The tractor had been screened from the </p><p>roads by a grove of trees, and it was with </p><p>mingled elation and fear that I led the way </p><p>to its resting-place. However, 1 was in no </p><p>way prepared for the sight which met my </p><p>eyes. I recognized the trees, the surround- </p><p>ing knolls, the exact spot: but there was </p><p>not a sign of the tractor! </p><p>‘it’s gone!” I exclaimed, rushing for- </p><p>ward. There was no doubt that this was </p><p>the right place. There was a patch of bare </p><p>ground, where the discharge had burned </p><p>away the grass. “Gone!” I repeated. </p><p>“Yes,” observed Quaile, “it seems to be </p><p>lake leave of one, eh?" His face wore a </p><p>knowing smile. He thought his suspicions </p><p>were confirmed, and that I was crazy be- </p><p>yond a doubt. </p><p>“Quaile,” I said fervently, “on my word </p><p>of honor, that machine was here. “I’m </p><p>going to take you to Dr. Willson and let </p><p>you hear from him the facts about this. </p><p>Whatever has become of the machine, I am </p><p>going lo prove to you that I am neither a </p><p>liar nor a lunatic!" </p><p>In a fit of hopelessness I turned toward </p><p>the city; but we had not gone ten paces when </p><p>I heard my name called. I turned, and saw </p><p>a man hurrying towards me over the near- </p><p>est hillock. </p><p>“Mr. Marland!” he called. We stopped, </p><p>and he caught up with us, out of breath. </p><p>It was ihe relief pilot! </p><p>“I was afraid I’d miss you, Mr. Marland,” </p><p>he panted. “The machine’s in a field a </p><p>couple of miles from here. Some picnick- </p><p>ers found it and got curious, and we had </p><p>to move it. One of us had been on the look- </p><p>out for you all the time. We thought you </p><p>never would come!” he added. </p><p>I was loo relieved lo ask any questions. </p><p>The pilot led the way over the hill lo </p><p>where a tent was pitched beside a battered </p><p>car. The crew had established a camp here </p><p>and kept a lookout night and day for my </p><p>return. We took down the tent, bundled it </p><p>into the car, and the three of us climbed in. </p><p>The pilot drove up off into the country, to </p><p>a bare, unsettled spot. There, in the hol- </p><p>low between two knolls, lay the traclor. </p><p>The pilot blew the horn of the decrepit </p><p>auto, and the rest of the crew, lacking only </p><p>one man, came tumbling out to greet us. </p><p>My amazement knew no bounds. With their </p><p>first opportunity to visit their homeland in </p><p>twelve years, these men had elected to live </p><p>right in the tractor! </p><p>CHAPTER IX. </p><p>A Leak! </p><p>THE pilot, acting as spokesman, ex- </p><p>plained the situation. </p><p>“We all went off to look up our families </p><p>and friends,” he said. “They thought we </p><p>were dead, and had made heroes of us. </p><p>When we showed up, hardly able to walk </p><p>on account of the gravity, and not know- </p><p>ing anything about what’s happened on </p><p>earth, they didn’t know what lo make of </p><p>it. And when we said we’d been on the </p><p>moon, they thought we were crazy. Our </p><p>wives and sweethearts have all married </p><p>other men,, and our friends didn’t know us. </p><p>We tried to get work, and couldn't hold a </p><p>decent man’s job. Nobody wants us here; </p><p>we’ve got friends on the moon. We want </p><p>to go back!” </p><p>Quaile was convinced. There was no- </p><p>thing left but to load our baggage and start </p><p>for the moon. I checked over the supplies </p><p>of food, water, and air in the machine, and </p><p>made a list of the things we would need. </p><p>Then we went back to the city, leaving the </p><p>crew to care for ihe tractor until our re- </p><p>turn. On the morrow we visited Dr. Will- </p><p>son, purchased our supplies and picked up</p><p>our baggage. Loading it into the car, which </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>873 </p><p>we had borrowed for the occasion, we drove </p><p>out to the tractor. The crew assisted in </p><p>loading, and in short order we were ready </p><p>to start off. </p><p>I climbed to the pilot house, rang the </p><p>warning gong, and sent ihe' gas roaring </p><p>through the central well. 1 paid no atten- </p><p>tion to the position of the moon, preferring </p><p>to set the course after we were free of the </p><p>earth. We climbed slowly at first, not wish- </p><p>ing to overload the machine, which must </p><p>exert a tremendous force merely to over- </p><p>come the earth’s pull, ll took us upwards of </p><p>an hour to reach a point sufficiently far </p><p>away to neglect its gravity. Then we turned </p><p>in a great circle toward the moon, which </p><p>was visible over the edge of the globe to </p><p>the west, toward the sun. The tractor gained </p><p>speed rapidly, and we were soon far away </p><p>from the earth in the midst of the airless </p><p>expanse of the solar system. </p><p>Quaile was immensely excited at the </p><p>strangeness of his surroundings. He re- </p><p>mained for a long time at one of the win- </p><p>dows, his eyes glued lo the glass, giving </p><p>vent from time to time to exclamations of </p><p>amazement. 1 could hardly restrain him </p><p>from turning the telescope in the pilot house </p><p>ori the planets, and he was filled with im- </p><p>patience when I told him that it v^puld take </p><p>two days to reach the moon. He explored </p><p>the tractor from end to end, asking innum- </p><p>erable questions about its construction, </p><p>source of power and the like. When my </p><p>shift in ihe pilot-house was over he bom- </p><p>barded me with queries about the colony </p><p>on the moon, which he had up lo now re- </p><p>garded as a figment of my imagination. </p><p>I told him what I could of the way it had </p><p>been built, the principles which made it </p><p>possible, and the work done there, but I </p><p>was hard put to satisfy his curiosity. It </p><p>was with ihe greatest difficulty lhat I per- </p><p>suaded him to take some sleep, and only </p><p>got him to do so by pointing out that the </p><p>time of our trip would seem shorter if he </p><p>did not remain awake so much. </p><p>By the time we. had reached the half- </p><p>way point and turned the Iractor about, </p><p>however, he lost some of his impatience. </p><p>He got out his violin and played to us for</p><p>an hour or more. He was really an excel- </p><p>lent musician and had a remarkable reper- </p><p>toire. His taste ran more to dreamy, sooth- </p><p>ing melodies and those of lighter charac- </p><p>ter, and between numbers he kept up a </p><p>running fire of talk, recounting the history </p><p>of each of his selections and explaining his </p><p>interpretation of them. He had an excellent </p><p>ear and possessed the sense of absolute </p><p>pitch to a high degree. There was no doubt </p><p>that, had he chosen lo do so, he could have </p><p>become a famous artist. </p><p>During the rendition of “Liebestraum” </p><p>he suddenly put down his bow and began </p><p>liming the strings. 1 had noticed nothing </p><p>wrong, but he said with a grimace: </p><p>“The thing’s deuced sharp. Must be that </p><p>the air's very dry here.” He picked up the </p><p>bow and continued playing, but he had </p><p>gone only a few bars when he again </p><p>stopped. </p><p>“Really,” he exclaimed, “it’s most as- </p><p>tounding! I never heard an instrument get </p><p>off pitch so quickly. The air has a re- </p><p>markable effect!” </p><p>SUDDENLY a thought flashed into my </p><p>mind: Sounds are higher-pitched in </p><p>thin air! </p><p>“The pressure!” I shouted. “Get into </p><p>your air-envelopes quick!” I dashed for </p><p>the suits hanging along the wall, noting the </p><p>air-gauge as I pulled on the nearest. The </p><p>pressure was only twelve pounds, and as </p><p>1 watched it fell lower. 1 rushed up lo the </p><p>engine room to warn the men on duty, </p><p>while others who had put on thair envel- </p><p>opes followed to relieve them. Then when </p><p>we were all protected, we set out lo hunt </p><p>for ihe leak. By closing the air light doors </p><p>between the compartments and noting the </p><p>air pressure in each we quickly located it </p><p>in the lowest section. The glass windows </p><p>were all intact; but after fifteen minutes’ </p><p>search we found a small break, clean as a </p><p>bullet hole, in the outside wall. </p><p>Let me stop a moment lo explain the </p><p>construction of the tractor’s walls, of which </p><p>there were two. The outer was built to </p><p>withstand the impact of meteorites too small </p><p>to be seen in the telescope. It was not air </p><p>tight; as soon as the machine left the at-</p><p>mosphere all the air between the outer and </p><p>874 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>inner walls escaped, leaving a perfect vac- </p><p>uum which prevented loss of heat by con- </p><p>vection. The inner wall was lighter, of </p><p>air proof construction, and was coated with </p><p>asbestos. Just before reversing the tractor, </p><p>when we were at the peak of our velocity, </p><p>we must have encountered a small object </p><p>of extreme hardness, which had punctured </p><p>both inner and outer walls. </p><p>We closed off this section of the interior, </p><p>welded a plug into the hole, and brought </p><p>the pressure up to normal from the reserve </p><p>tanks. Then out of curiosity we began a </p><p>search for the meteorite which had caused </p><p>the trouble. Quaile spied it, in a corner </p><p>near the air lock. He brought it to the </p><p>light where we examined it. It was per- </p><p>haps half an inch in diameter, with a rough </p><p>surface unde? which a tiny glitter of fire </p><p>could be seen. Quaile rubbed il sharply </p><p>against the steel partition, making a deep </p><p>scratch. </p><p>“A diamond!” he exclaimed. “A dia- </p><p>mond flying through space!” </p><p>There could be no doubt as to the cor- </p><p>rectness of his assertion. The characteris- </p><p>tic hardness, the fiery sparkle—it was the </p><p>rarest of meteoric stones, which had struck </p><p>our tractor by the barest chance. </p><p>Quaile pocketed the stone as a souvenir. </p><p>“Y’know,” he said, “I rather like this </p><p>space-flying, what with picking up diamonds </p><p>and all. But I hope we don’t meet them </p><p>much bigger!” </p><p>A little over two days’ travel brought us </p><p>close to the moon. We circled rapidly </p><p>around its surface to the spot on the equa- </p><p>tor where Dr. Forscher’s outpost was locat- </p><p>ed. Quaile never ceased to enthuse over </p><p>the wild, rugged landscape beneath us, eye- </p><p>ing it with binoculars for many minutes. </p><p>He seemed amazed that none of us had tak- </p><p>en the time to explore it mile by mile, or </p><p>examine the character of the rocks and the </p><p>depths of the fissures. This had been left </p><p>to the geologists of the colony, and none of </p><p>us was acquainted with the results of their </p><p>work. </p><p>The Great Telescope</p><p>WHEN we sighted the protruding air- </p><p>locks of the entrance near the en- </p><p>closure where the tractors were stored, his </p><p>excitement knew no bounds. The chief of </p><p>transportation was on hand to greet us, </p><p>and as we donned the radio-equipped air </p><p>envelopes his voice could be plainly heard, </p><p>giving directions to the mechanics who were </p><p>to overhaul our tractor. We descended the </p><p>elevator in the air-lock shaft, and were met </p><p>by Dr. Langley in the corridor inside. I </p><p>introduced Quaile, and Langley immediately </p><p>escorted him to the quarters which had been </p><p>prepared for him. 1 departed for the apart- </p><p>ment which I shared with Wiley, and found </p><p>him there. He jumped to his feet as 1 en- </p><p>tered, his face beaming. </p><p>“Welcome back, old man!” he exclaimed, </p><p>pumping my hand. “What news from terra </p><p>firma?” </p><p>I told him of my visit to Dr. Willson, and </p><p>recounted my adventures while in America. </p><p>He listened eagerly, interjecting questions </p><p>about his colleagues at the City College. I </p><p>could tell him little of them, having spent </p><p>so short a time there, which I now regretted. </p><p>When I had finished, I asked: </p><p>“How’s the telescope going?” </p><p>“Finished!” replied Wiley. “Finished </p><p>and tested. Man, what a marvelous thing! </p><p>They’ve got a picture of a sun-spot that will </p><p>knock youifc eye out! I never saw such </p><p>clearness. You see, when Dr. Forscher </p><p>knew there was lo be an astronomer short- </p><p>ly, he pushed the work to the limit, and </p><p>they put it together in record time. It was </p><p>tested out only a few days ago, and the old </p><p>Doctor was so tickled with it he nearly </p><p>smiled!” </p><p>This news set me all a-tingle. I would </p><p>have set off at once for the observatory, but </p><p>Wiley counselled otherwise. </p><p>“It’s bed for you, young fellow,” he said. </p><p>“You’re dog-tired, even if you don’t know </p><p>it. You look as if you hadn’t slept for a </p><p>month.” </p><p>I agreed reluctantly, and we turned in; </p><p>but sleep was long in coming, and filled </p><p>with scrambled dreams of tiny worlds, sul-</p><p>phur meteors, huge telescopes and diamonds </p><p>from the Great Void. </p><p>After breakfast there was a conference. </p><p>Dr. Forscher, Wiley and Quaile were pre- </p><p>sent, and I was invited as a matter of cour- </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>875 </p><p>tesy. As usual, the Doctor dominated the </p><p>conversation. Addressing himself first to </p><p>Quaile, he said: </p><p>“I have put forth every effort to produce </p><p>the most perfect telescope humanly possi- </p><p>ble, as you have been informed.No doubt </p><p>Mr. Marland has told you, as well, my prin- </p><p>cipal motive in doing this. I have person- </p><p>ally tested out the instrument, making pho- </p><p>tographs of the sun and other bodies, with </p><p>very gratifying results; but I have deferred </p><p>the work for which it was designed until </p><p>your arrival. In our laboratories here on </p><p>the moon we have worked out methods of </p><p>photography which we believe excel those </p><p>in use when I was actively engaged in as- </p><p>tronomical work some years ago. How- </p><p>ever, there may have been developments in </p><p>the technique on earth of which I know </p><p>nothing; and for this reason I shall turn </p><p>over the major portion of the research to </p><p>you. after giving you the benefit of our </p><p>developments.” </p><p>"1 am greatly honored,” said Quaile sim- </p><p>'ply. “Of course I shall want to spend some </p><p>time getting acquainted with the instrument </p><p>so that I can interpret the results accurate- </p><p>ly-” </p><p>“That is wise. You will have ample op- </p><p>portunity to do so,” returned the Doctor. </p><p>“The body upon which this research is to </p><p>be conducted is the largest satellite of the </p><p>planet Jupiter, euphoniously named Gany- </p><p>mede by its discoverer. Jupiter is not now </p><p>visible from the observatory; it will rise in </p><p>something less than two hundred hours, and </p><p>remain visible thereafter upwards of three </p><p>hundred. I hope that in that space of time </p><p>enough work can be done to give some in- </p><p>dication of the condition of the satellite.” </p><p>“I'll do my best,” promised Quaile. </p><p>“Very well,” said the doctor. “I’ll leave </p><p>you to your own devices, with the under- </p><p>standing that you may call on anyone here </p><p>for whatever assistance you may wish.” </p><p>THE brief meeting broke up, the three </p><p>of us leaving the doctor alone. Wiley </p><p>had experiments in progress at the Physics </p><p>Laboratory, but I was a man of leisure for</p><p>the present, and at Quaile’s invitation I ac- </p><p>companied him to the observatory. We had </p><p>had a brief glimpse of the telescope shortly </p><p>after his arrival, but had not yet had an </p><p>opportunity to explore the observatory or </p><p>look into the eyepiece. When we reached </p><p>the dome we found one of the men who had </p><p>been engaged in directing the construction </p><p>and assembling of the instrument. He was </p><p>clad in an air envelope, and before going </p><p>further he motioned us to dress ourselves </p><p>similarly. Then we proceeded through the </p><p>nearby air lock and entered the telescope </p><p>dome. Our conductor explained the opera- </p><p>tion of the instrument as we made a tour </p><p>of the room. </p><p>It was obviously impossible to keep air </p><p>in the dome of the observatory, but there </p><p>was a small booth mounted near the base of </p><p>the telescope which could be hermetically </p><p>sealed, so that the observer need not wear </p><p>his envelope. Here he might look directly </p><p>at the image from the big mirror, or guide </p><p>the photographic plate by means of an auxi- </p><p>liary eye-piece. </p><p>The observatory was located exactly on </p><p>the moon’s equator. This served two im- </p><p>portant purposes. In mounting so enor- </p><p>mous a telescope it would have been diffi- </p><p>cult in the extreme to tilt its axis at an </p><p>angle; yet the mounting must enable the in- </p><p>strument to follow the path of any star </p><p>across the heavens. At the equator the stars </p><p>rose at right angles to the horizon, followed </p><p>an arc of a circle across the sky, and set </p><p>perpendicularly. In addition, every star in </p><p>the firmament (except the earth, for the ob- </p><p>servatory was on the side which nevec faces </p><p>it ) was visible at one time or another. The </p><p>two pole stars lay always on the rim of the </p><p>horizon, while all the rest circled about </p><p>them, showing themselves for half of each </p><p>twenty-eight (earth) day revolution. </p><p>The polar axis of the telescope was con- </p><p>nected to an enormous driving clock, timed </p><p>to follow the slowly creeping stars across </p><p>the heavens. Once set going, it required </p><p>no further adjustment, pursuing the tiny </p><p>lights as they wended their way in a body </p><p>from east to west during their two weeks of </p><p>visibility. The observatory dome also ro- </p><p>tated, keeping its broad slit always between </p><p>the great mirror and the stars on which it </p><p>was trained.</p><p>876 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>Quaile examined every detail of the ap- </p><p>paratus, uttering exclamations of delight </p><p>and admiration. We climbed to the obser- </p><p>ver’s booth and, removing our helmets, </p><p>looked into the eyepiece. The telescope </p><p>was trained on the star cluster known as </p><p>the Pleiades, whose familiar “seven sisters” </p><p>were now mingled with countless thousands </p><p>of tiny points, dotting the field like rain- </p><p>drops on a pavement. </p><p>Quaile decided to try out the telescope </p><p>himself at once. He secured a number of </p><p>plates already prepared and returned to the </p><p>dome. I watched him as he swung the huge </p><p>tube across the sky, training it upon Mars. </p><p>He slipped a negative inlo the plate holder, </p><p>made final adjustments of the direction and </p><p>focus of the instrument, and climbed to the </p><p>observer’s station. I watched as he follow- </p><p>ed the progress of the planet. It was nec- </p><p>essary for him to watch it constantly, shift- </p><p>ing the photographic plate by a hair’s </p><p>breadth from time lo time. The tremen- </p><p>dous magnification of the planet’s image </p><p>also magnified imperceptible irregularities </p><p>in the driving clock, so that the variation of </p><p>a fraction of a millimeter would destroy sur- </p><p>face details in the picture. In starting the </p><p>exposure Quaile had centered his cross hairs </p><p>on some minute spot of the planet’s disc, </p><p>and his trained eyes were best able to keep </p><p>it there. </p><p>An Illusion Destroyed </p><p>AT length he climbed down from the </p><p>booth and removed the plate. </p><p>“Thai should do it,” he said. “Now let’s </p><p>see what we’ve got.” We hastened off to the </p><p>photographic laboratory, where the plate </p><p>was carefully developed. A group of as- </p><p>sistant astronomers and photographers sur- </p><p>rounded us as we bent over the negative. </p><p>It bore little resemblance to a visual image </p><p>of the ruddy planet, for in addition to its </p><p>colorless blackening, bright spots were </p><p>marked by the deepest shadows, leaving </p><p>blank patches in place of the darker areas. </p><p>Nevertheless I realized that it was by far </p><p>the best piece of work of its kind ever seen. </p><p>The planet appeared 320 times larger than </p><p>the full moon as seen with the unaided eye, </p><p>so that only a part of its disc was shown on </p><p>the plate. With a little imagination I could </p><p>picture myself suspended a bare 750 miles </p><p>from its surface, seeing it as it might some </p><p>day look to the venturesome pioneer who </p><p>first landed there. I looked in vain for the </p><p>famous “canals”; there were irregular </p><p>patches of dark color, the more prominent </p><p>ones approximating straight lines, but that </p><p>was all. The supposed irrigation system </p><p>was an optical illusion which disappeared </p><p>on better examination. </p><p>Quaile went back to the observatory to </p><p>make more photographs. lie was immense- </p><p>ly pleased with the success of his first ef- </p><p>fort, and now had the opportunity he had </p><p>longed for to determine, once for all, what </p><p>was to be found in the Martian atmosphere. </p><p>During the next few days he told of his </p><p>achievements along this line; and in doing </p><p>so he blasted one of the most fascinating </p><p>ideas which mankind has ever invented, </p><p>namely, the existence of a race of super-be- </p><p>ings who had engineered huge water chan- </p><p>nels to supply melting ice from the polar </p><p>caps. He found that there was water, true </p><p>enough, but only as a vapor and in very </p><p>small amounts, while the total absence of </p><p>carbon dioxide and oxygen showed conclu- </p><p>sively that any such highly developed or- </p><p>ganism as the human body could never en- </p><p>dure there. Without oxygen to breathe and </p><p>carbon dioxide to retain through the night </p><p>the meager heat of the sunlit hours, all ani- </p><p>mal life must have long since succumbed to </p><p>the rigorous climate. </p><p>The results of this investigation only </p><p>served to increase ihe impatience of the col- </p><p>ony. Did this unpromising news mean that </p><p>Ganymede, too, was a desert world, devoid </p><p>of living beings, and that the earth alone </p><p>was capable of supporting an intelligent </p><p>race? It was not encouraging, to say the </p><p>least. Yet if this were true, how to ex- </p><p>plain the sulphur meteors? We must not </p><p>jump at conclusions; the riddle would be </p><p>solved in a short time, and all awaited eag- </p><p>erly the rising of Jupiter and his attendant </p><p>moons. </p><p>Quaile and his assistants were in a bustle </p><p>of preparation, while Dr. Forscher himself </p><p>had taken charge of the construction of an </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>877 </p><p>extremely sensitive instrument to measure </p><p>the temperature of Ganymede’s surface. It </p><p>was a refinement of apparatus used for sim- </p><p>ilar purposes by astronomers, and was </p><p>based on the fact that when two wires of </p><p>different metals are joined to form a closed </p><p>circuit, an electric current is produced by </p><p>warming one of the junctions. The current </p><p>could be measured with a delicate galvano- </p><p>meter, and the temperature of a distant body </p><p>thus computed.* </p><p>As the hour of Jupiter’s rising drew near, </p><p>an audience gathered in the observatory. </p><p>With eyes strained to the east they waited— </p><p>scientist and laborer, standing shoulder to </p><p>shoulder, waiting for the consummation of </p><p>twelve years’ efforts. Their voices, magni- </p><p>fied by the radio .speaker* of their envelopes, </p><p>bespoke the emotions which filled them. </p><p>There were not a few who held watches in </p><p>their hands, and by one or another the pass- </p><p>ing of each minute was announced. A </p><p>heavy voice from somewhere near me roared </p><p>a facetious admonition to the Prince of The </p><p>Solar System not to keep his audience wait- </p><p>ing, and there was a ripple of laughter. </p><p>Then a shout broke through the tumult. </p><p>‘•There he is!” </p><p>AN instant of awed admiration followed </p><p>as the yellow dot of the planet’s face </p><p>balanced on the horizon, globing steadily </p><p>like a tiny diamond. Those on the outer </p><p>edge of the group crowded forward to get </p><p>a better view through the wide opening of </p><p>the dome. The heavy-voiced joker called </p><p>for a cheer, and it was given by the over- </p><p>enthusiastic. Then someone set up a shout </p><p>for Quaile which was.taken up by the </p><p>group. </p><p>"Where’s the astronomer? Why isn’t he </p><p>on the job?” </p><p>I left the observatory and set off in search </p><p>of Quaile. He was dozing; in his apart- </p><p>ment, stretched out in an easy chair. An </p><p>open book lay heedlessly on the floor beside </p><p>him: his burned pipe had slipped from his </p><p>fingers, cascading ashes on the carpet. His </p><p>face wore an expression of peaceful oblivion </p><p>•Tills instrumenl. the thermocouple, is easily</p><p>capable of detecting the heat of a candle a </p><p>mile or more distant. </p><p>to the question which had fired the imag- </p><p>ination of the entire colony. </p><p>“Quaile!” 1 exclaimed. “Jupiter’s ris- </p><p>en!” </p><p>He awoke with a start.‘Take it easy, </p><p>young fella. No rush—Ganymede’s eclip- </p><p>sed right now; hiding behind Jupiter like </p><p>a bashful kid. Maybe it knows we’re look- </p><p>ing through the keyhole. 1 was just catch- </p><p>ing forty winks before I get started. I’ll </p><p>be in for a long pull.” </p><p>I apologised for my impetuousness. He </p><p>waved it aside. </p><p>“Pull up a chair and chat a minute.” I </p><p>complied. </p><p>“This thing’s got you all on edge, like </p><p>the rest of them,” he observed. “No doubt </p><p>they think I’ll have the answer in time for </p><p>dinner. I wish 1 could, but, y’understand, </p><p>there’s a sight of work to do. I’m going to </p><p>make dozens of plates; no one of them </p><p>would tell the story. I’d be missing a bet </p><p>if 1 didn’t get all 1 could on the whole sys- </p><p>tem—Jupiter and all the other satellites. </p><p>Might turn up something from them that </p><p>would tell us quite a lot. The doctor </p><p>doesn’t want guesses: he wants proof.” </p><p>I could not help admiring the man’s </p><p>quiet, common sense attitude. Why expect </p><p>results in a day, after twelve years of pre- </p><p>paration? And the doctor; he wasn’t up </p><p>there at the observatory yelling for action. </p><p>No doubt, like Quaile, he was calmly await- </p><p>ing the most propitious moment for his tem- </p><p>perature measurements. </p><p>“Can’t say as I blame these fellows for </p><p>getting excited,” said Quaile. “I suppose </p><p>1 must get along and start the show.” He </p><p>arose and stretched himself. “Want to </p><p>come along and watch?” </p><p>“Thanks,” I said, “but I think I’ll do some </p><p>reading and turn in. You’ll have audience </p><p>enough without me.” </p><p>“I dare say,” he agreed. “I hate to disap- </p><p>point them, but they’ll probably see little </p><p>enough for awhile.”</p><p>We set off, he to the observatory and I to </p><p>my apartment, to kill time as best I could. </p><p>As Quaile had said, there was no point in </p><p>anticipating results so soon; Dr. Forscher </p><p>had allowed the two weeks between the ris- </p><p>ing and setting of Jupiter as a minimum, </p><p>878 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>and there was no doubt that the two of them </p><p>would waste no time getting as much data </p><p>as possible, leaving the examination of it </p><p>until the planet was no longer visible. </p><p>Forcing this thoughl into my mind 1 set- </p><p>tled down to await the passing of the inter- </p><p>vening time. </p><p>CHAPTER X </p><p>What The Telescope Revealed </p><p>THROUGHOUT the colony, the air of </p><p>expectation and impatience continued. </p><p>At mealtimes there was much speculation as </p><p>to the progress being made, but no one con- </p><p>nected with the observatory was present; </p><p>they worked almost continuously, stopping </p><p>now and then to eat or lake a few hours’ </p><p>sleep at their posts. The workmen, who </p><p>did not understand the scientific aspect of </p><p>the task, could not understand the neces- </p><p>sity of so much delay; not a few of them </p><p>held the view that the inhabitants of Gany- </p><p>mede could be seen directly through the </p><p>telescope, that it was merely a matter of </p><p>looking at them to discover their appear- </p><p>ance, habits, and such. Having had some </p><p>practical experience with a telescope in my </p><p>college days, 1 undertook to explain the </p><p>situation to a few who asked me about it, </p><p>and presently I found myself conducting </p><p>an informal class in elementary astronomy. </p><p>I was glad of the opportunity which pre- </p><p>sented itself to discuss the subject, and lec- </p><p>tured in such glowing style that Wiley, who </p><p>happened in on one of the gatherings, dubb- </p><p>ed me “Professor Marland ” forthwith. </p><p>At length Jupiter disappeared below the </p><p>horizon, and excitement reached fever pitch. </p><p>Everyone was on edge, waiting for word of </p><p>the results. But Quaile and Dr. Forscher </p><p>had retired to their quarters for a well-earn- </p><p>ed sleep before doing anything further. </p><p>And so forty-eight hours more passed and </p><p>nothing was learned. </p><p>During the third day following Jupiter’s </p><p>disappearance, the word passed around that </p><p>Dr. Forscher would meet those interested </p><p>in the experiments at his office after dinner. </p><p>“Those interested” turned out to be almost </p><p>the entire colony, and the meeting adjourn- </p><p>ed to the dining hall, where a platform of </p><p>tables was improvised and chairs gathered </p><p>around. Dr. Forscher took the platform. </p><p>Because of the size, and heterogeneous char- </p><p>acter of his audience, he elected to begin </p><p>his announcement with an explanation of </p><p>the experimental procedure. The gathering </p><p>thus assumed the nature of a popular lec- </p><p>ture. </p><p>“As you are all aware,” he began, “we </p><p>have been testing a theory which I formu- </p><p>lated fifty years ago, and which has been the </p><p>greatest interest of my entire life. Because </p><p>of the appearance of certain mysterious met- </p><p>eors, I was led to believe that the satellite </p><p>Ganymede might be the abode of intelli- </p><p>gent, civilized life. Scientists at the time </p><p>were of the opinion that this was impossible, </p><p>because of its great distance from the sun. </p><p>Ganymede revolves around the planet Jupi- </p><p>ter once every seven days, three and three- </p><p>quarters hours, at a mean distance from that </p><p>planet of six hundred and sixty thousand </p><p>miles. Its distance from the sun, there- </p><p>fore, is about four hundred and eighty mil- </p><p>lion miles. The earth is less than one fifth </p><p>that distance, so that Ganymede receives </p><p>only about one twenty-seventh as much </p><p>light and heat from the sun as does the </p><p>earth.* </p><p>“This is obviously too slight an amount </p><p>to support any animal life we know, for the </p><p>temperature must fall many degrees below </p><p>zero unless there are modifying factors. </p><p>“However, the appearance of the sulphur </p><p>meteors seemed to indicate that there must </p><p>be modifying factors. A few figures will </p><p>suffice to show that too much must not be </p><p>expected of even our great telescope. Jup- </p><p>iter is at present about four hundred and </p><p>fifty million miles from us. The telescope </p><p>magnifies it one hundred thousand limes, re- </p><p>ducing the apparent distance to forty-five </p><p>hundred miles. In other words, Ganymede </p><p>appears to us about fifty-four times as </p><p>large as the full moon. We have there- </p><p>•The intensity of radiant energy such as sun- </p><p>light is inversely proportional to the square </p><p>of the distance from the -source.

Our re- </p><p>sults are curious, but they are very satis- </p><p>factory. </p><p>“We find that the four major satellites of </p><p>Jupiter constitute a series much like the </p><p>four inner planets of the solar system. </p><p>They appear to show four stages of a pro- </p><p>gressive evolution from unendurable heat to </p><p>freezing cold. Some of ihe phenomei.a of </p><p>these stages have already been noted by </p><p>terrestrial astronomers, notably their den- </p><p>sity and their albedo, or ability to reflect </p><p>light. The amount of sunlight reflected </p><p>from any planet depends on the nature of </p><p>the surface we see. Thus Venus, the bright- </p><p>est of the planets, is covered with clouds </p><p>which turn back nearly three fourths of the </p><p>sun’s rays, while Mars, with his thin atmos- </p><p>phere and desert surface, can return only </p><p>fifteen percent. It has been well known </p><p>that Jupiter’s satellites differed among </p><p>themselves in this respect.* </p><p>“Io, closest to the primary, reflects fully </p><p>half the light which strikes it, indicating </p><p>that it must be covered by an envelope of </p><p>clouds, as is Venus. Europa is even </p><p>brighter. The clouds are thinner, and per- </p><p>haps broken in spots; certainly they are less </p><p>dense over one part than elsewhere. As the </p><p>satellite revolves about Jupiter we note that </p><p>one part of its face always appears dim- </p><p>mer than the rest. Callisto, the outermost </p><p>of the four, behaves similarly, its surface </p><p>being the least bright of all. </p><p>“It has also been previously noted that </p><p>the density of the satellites grows progres- </p><p>sively less from Io to Callisto.* The latter </p><p>would almost float in water', while the for- </p><p>mer is much like our moon in size and </p><p>weight. A cubic foot of its soil, on the </p><p>average, would weigh about three-fifths as </p><p>much as the same amount taken from the </p><p>earth. Ganymede, in this respect is inter- </p><p>mediate between Callisto and Europa. </p><p>•Cf. for example pages 369-372. Russell, Dugan </p><p>&amp; Stewart, •‘Astronomy," Vol. I, Ginn &amp; Co. </p><p>“These facts are not new. But let us </p><p>now consider the work we have just com- </p><p>pleted. The best measurements of temper- </p><p>ature heretofore have shown that Jupiter </p><p>never rises much above 140 degrees (Centi- </p><p>grade) below zero at the surface, and it </p><p>has been supposed that the satellites are </p><p>similarly cold. However, my figures indi- </p><p>cate a different situation. The value for </p><p>Jupiter is substantially correct, but the satel- </p><p>lites are much warmer. Why this should </p><p>be true I am not prepared to say at present, </p><p>but nevertheless it is so. Io, revolving close </p><p>to Jupiter, is around 200 degrees above zero </p><p>—twice as hot as boiling water. Europa </p><p>shows a temperature of 96 degrees, which is </p><p>just below the boiling point on earth. It </p><p>is worth remarking, however, that water </p><p>boils at different temperatures, depending </p><p>on the atmospheric pressure. By placing a </p><p>dish of water in a vacuum il is perfectly </p><p>possible to have it boiling and freezing at </p><p>the same time. We cannot be sure, there- </p><p>fore, that there is liquid water on Europa; </p><p>but with Ganymede such is very probably </p><p>the case. The temperature is a few degrees </p><p>above the freezing point. Part of the time, </p><p>at least, there must be open water on its sur- </p><p>face, and from the cloudiness of its atmos- </p><p>phere I venture to predict that streams, </p><p>lakes and oceans may he found. Callisto </p><p>is a frozen world, little warmer than Jupi- </p><p>ter itself. It would seem thal the satellites </p><p>must receive some sort of energy from that </p><p>planet, since ihe reduction of temperature </p><p>corresponds to their increasing distance </p><p>from it. </p><p>“Turning now to the photographs for </p><p>which we have labored to build our magni- </p><p>ficent telescope, the evidence of a progres- </p><p>sive series continues. Mr. Quaile has made </p><p>excellent photographs of the light of these </p><p>satellites with the spectroscope, the greatest </p><p>aid to astronomy since the invention of the </p><p>telescope. There is a parody on a familiar </p><p>jingle which runs: </p><p>‘Twinkle, twinkle, little star; </p><p>Now we’ve found oul what you are, </p><p>When unto the midnight sky </p><p>We the spectroscope apply!’</p><p>“Mr. Quaile’s photographs show that the </p><p>four satellites we are studying have quite </p><p>880 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>different atmospheres. Io is the hottest, we </p><p>have found; hence we might reasonably ex- </p><p>pect active volcanoes covering its surface, </p><p>which should have cooled only enough to </p><p>be thinly crusted over with solid matter. </p><p>Observations of the vapors from erupting </p><p>craters have shown us what to expect in the </p><p>air of such a world,* and our spectroscope </p><p>bears out the prediction. There is no oxy- </p><p>gen whatsoever, but in its stead quantities </p><p>of carbon dioxide, and choking poisonous </p><p>gases such as chlorine and carbon mono- </p><p>xide. 1 hardly need point out that life in </p><p>such an atmosphere would be impossible. </p><p>Chlorine helped to make the World War the </p><p>horror it was, and the frequent deaths from </p><p>minute quantities of carbon monoxide in </p><p>automobile exhausts indicate the unfriend- </p><p>liness of the latter to living creatures. </p><p>Life Discovered </p><p>tt l^l'ROPA is not much better off. The </p><p>1—J atmosphere is denser and better able </p><p>to support clouds of water vapor. Volcan- </p><p>ic gases predominate, though not to such an </p><p>extent as on the sister satellite, as there is </p><p>enough oxygen to reduce some of them to </p><p>harmlessness. </p><p>“On Ganymede the volcanic activity is </p><p>unimportant, if not entirely absent. Sun- </p><p>light. heat, and growing plants have split up </p><p>the carbon dioxide into carbon and oxy- </p><p>gen. As on the earth, nitrogen forms the </p><p>rest of the atmosphere. This world has </p><p>passed the destructive youth of its two </p><p>smaller sisters, and has blossomed in moth- </p><p>erhood. </p><p>“Callisto is the spinster of the quartet; </p><p>she has passed into sterility without ever </p><p>being capable of supporting life. Her froz- </p><p>en face is thinly covered with a layer of </p><p>nitrogen, from which carbon dioxide, water </p><p>and oxygen have departed to unite with oth- </p><p>er elements or litter the ground with snow.** </p><p>“To sum up, then: Ganymede is the lar- </p><p>gest and most massive of Jupiter’s satellites. </p><p>•According lo Svante Arrhenius ("The Destinies </p><p>«f ilie .Stars," Chapter V; G.P. Putnam's Sons) </p><p>the following gases have been found in tlie</p><p>vapors of several volcanoes: carbon dioxide </p><p>(over 50%), carbon monoxide, nitrogen, hydro- </p><p>gen, chlorine, sulphurous acid, ami traces of </p><p>ethers. </p><p>In its atmosphere we find all the conditions </p><p>essential to life—water, oxygen and carbon </p><p>dioxide, in the proper proportions. The </p><p>temperature is mild, and there are bodies of </p><p>open water. Volcanic activity is much re- </p><p>duced, and the poisonous gases are gone </p><p>from the air. Plant life is indicated by the </p><p>presence of free oxygen, which it helps to </p><p>produce. </p><p>“To these facts add the appearance of </p><p>meteors which cannot be the work of na- </p><p>ture, at intervals which correspond exactly </p><p>to the length of Ganymede’s day, and there </p><p>can be little doubt that a race of intelligent </p><p>beings lives here, building machines, inves- </p><p>tigating nature’s ways as we do, and seek- </p><p>ing to tell us of their existence and interest </p><p>in us. Common courtesy requires that we </p><p>make an attempt to acknowledge their mes- </p><p>sage. It is to that end that I shall now </p><p>turn the resources of this colony.” </p><p>As the doctor finished speaking a hubbub </p><p>broke out over the room. There were scat- </p><p>tered cheers for the inhabitants of Gany- </p><p>mede, for the doctor, and for Quaile. But </p><p>the scientific group was more interested in </p><p>the last remark. Communication with an </p><p>unknown race on another world hundreds </p><p>of millions of miles distant! How was it </p><p>to be accomplished? Did the doctor intend </p><p>to fire sulphur meteors back to Ganymede, </p><p>and thus let them know we recognized their </p><p>interest in us? Possibly, though that seem- </p><p>ed a rather unsatisfactory means of inter- </p><p>course. Perhaps a better method would </p><p>be to prepare a manuscript with a key to </p><p>the language and shoot il at the satellite; </p><p>but what were the chances of its ever fall- </p><p>"A question naturally comes to mind: why </p><p>should the moon be devoid of air, while these </p><p>worlds, on which the force of gravity is nearly </p><p>the same as here, have dense atmospheric en- </p><p>velopes? For answer we must turn to a theory </p><p>known as ihe Kinetic Molecular Hypothesis. </p><p>From il we learn that a ga.s is not a continu- </p><p>ous fluid, hut is composed of tiny particles in </p><p>rapid motion. Their speed depends on tempera- </p><p>ture: the hotter the gas .becomes, the faster </p><p>they move. With sufficient heat, some of them </p><p>are always Hying away into space, never to re-</p><p>turn. The sun warms our moon to the point </p><p>where all the atmospheric gases would have </p><p>gradually leaked off. once rhe volcanoes were </p><p>dead. This must also be tlie case witli lo, </p><p>but more gas is always coming from its active </p><p>craters. Europa's lower temperature permits </p><p>fewer molecules to escape; thus we find a </p><p>denser atmosphere. Ganymede and Callisto are </p><p>cool enough so that only the lightest gases </p><p>have departed. </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>881 </p><p>ing into the right hands, even supposing it </p><p>was not captured and engulfed by Jupiter? </p><p>AS these thoughts ran through my mind, </p><p>I discovered that the scientific staff </p><p>was following Dr. Forscher out of the din- </p><p>ing hall, to his office. Wiley was among </p><p>the group and motioned me to join them, </p><p>so I fell into line, wondering what was in </p><p>the wind. We entered the doctor’s office </p><p>and assembled about his desk. </p><p>“1 have asked you here,” he said, “to of- </p><p>fer suggestions as to the best means of com- </p><p>municating with the inhabitants of Gany- </p><p>mede. 1 should like to see this accomplish- </p><p>ed before I am forced to retire, so let us </p><p>waste as little time as possible in devising a </p><p>method. Have you any suggestions?” </p><p>One of the group, whom I recognized as </p><p>Alvin Dalton, a chemist of considerable ab- </p><p>ility, spoke. </p><p>“It would be quite possible to make a </p><p>meteor which would behave like those you </p><p>saw fifty years ago,” he said. </p><p>“Undoubtedly,” agreed the doctor, “but </p><p>there would be too great a difficulty in </p><p>aiming it properly. The attraction of the </p><p>earth is sufficient to capture a projectile </p><p>which comes fairly close to it, but in shoot- </p><p>ing at Ganymede we should have to aim </p><p>much more carefully, or Jupiter’s tremen- </p><p>dous gravitational field would pull it' in. </p><p>Then, too, I would prefer something which </p><p>would lead to an interchange of messages.” </p><p>“Such as radio?” asked a member of the </p><p>staff of physicists. </p><p>“No good,” put in Wiley. “We could </p><p>never make a wave reach that far. The </p><p>best that’s been done yet is to send a mes- </p><p>sage around the earth. To reach Gany- </p><p>mede the waves would have to be sixty-four </p><p>million times stronger.” </p><p>“And even if they got there, how do we </p><p>know the Ganymedians would have an ap- </p><p>paratus to receive them?” The speaker was </p><p>Dr. Ernst, a psychologist. </p><p>Quaile, seated at the back of the group, </p><p>leaned forward through a cloud of tobacco</p><p>smoke and observed, </p><p>“Y’know, that flying machine rather took </p><p>my fancy. Couldn’t you send it out there </p><p>and talk to the fellows first-hand?” </p><p>‘The idea is intriguing,” admitted the </p><p>doctor, “but there are difficulties. None </p><p>of the tractors could carry enough synthium </p><p>to go out and back. Even if they could, </p><p>it would take too long. They are built for </p><p>a maximum velocity of fifteen thousand </p><p>feet per second; not that they could not go </p><p>much faster, for of course there is nothing </p><p>to hinder them; but at that speed there is </p><p>barely sufficient time to detect obstructions </p><p>and avoid them. You had one encounter </p><p>with a meteoric stone at high speed, Mr. </p><p>Quaile. Yet at that pace it would require </p><p>five years to make the trip in one direction.” </p><p>It was Dr. Langley’s turn to offer an idea. </p><p>“Suppose the machine were very long, </p><p>and tapered uniformly. Any small bodies </p><p>that chanced to meet it would hit a steep- </p><p>ly slanted surface, and glance off. There </p><p>would be no difficulty about building a tel- </p><p>escope which could pick up the larger ones </p><p>in time; and with a gravity screen—” </p><p>“Exactly,” interposed Wiley. “That </p><p>would have a great deal of power in getting </p><p>away from the moon. Then, too, there </p><p>would be no danger of falling onto Jupi- </p><p>ter if we passed too close.” </p><p>“We’re getting on,” said the doctor. “I </p><p>suggest that we let Mr. Wiley and Dr. </p><p>Langley work out the plans for the mach- </p><p>ine and show them to me. Perhaps that </p><p>will be the solution.” </p><p>Back to our apartment once more, Wiley </p><p>and I fell to discussing the proposed space </p><p>flyer. I had imagined it would resemble </p><p>a torpedo, but Wiley’s idea was different. </p><p>“The streamline form,” he said, “is </p><p>adapted lo travelling in air or water, but it </p><p>wouldn’t suit the purpose of this machine. </p><p>The idea is to present everywhere the least </p><p>possible angle lo its path, so that a meteor- </p><p>ite would glance off readily no matter where </p><p>it struck. If the machine had a snub nose </p><p>and curving sides, the front end would be </p><p>practically flat and there would be no </p><p>chance for the obstruction to bounce off; </p><p>it would go right through. What we want </p><p>i* a pointed end; and since the machine</p><p>must be reversed to stop, both ends should </p><p>be pointed, something like this.” </p><p>882 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>CHAPTER XI </p><p>On To Ganymede </p><p>HE sketched the design rapidly. The </p><p>machine resembled two narrow cones, </p><p>base to base, coming to a sharp point at </p><p>one end and cut off at the oilier to allow </p><p>for ihe opening through which the driving </p><p>gases would escape. The diameter at the </p><p>middle was about fifteen feet, and the total </p><p>length about one hundred and eighty. </p><p>“Must it be as narrow as that?” I asked. </p><p>“You don’t allow for much head room </p><p>after you put in a level floor.” </p><p>“Thinking of submarines?” he queried. </p><p>“Consider a moment; which way will this </p><p>thing travel?” </p><p>“Why—pointed end first, I suppose,” I </p><p>said. </p><p>“Right. And which way will the accel- </p><p>eration lend lo push you?” </p><p>“Toward the rear,” I said. “Of course! </p><p>The occupants will stand with their heads </p><p>toward the point. So the floors will have </p><p>to be crosswise, not the length of the mach- </p><p>ine.” </p><p>“Exactly.” Wiley continued to sketch </p><p>the machine, placing the driving apparatus </p><p>just back of the center, with ihe generators </p><p>and cooling apparatus surrounding it, add- </p><p>ing storage batteries and air tanks in the </p><p>slender forward end, and finally the living </p><p>quarters near the middle. </p><p>“That will serve as a preliminary design.” </p><p>he said. “I’ll see Langley after a while and </p><p>get his ideas. Now for some calculations.” </p><p>He got out his slide rule and table of </p><p>logarithms, and began filling sheets of pa- </p><p>per with figures. Presently he emitted a </p><p>whistle. </p><p>“Here’s something to think about,” he </p><p>said. “I’m starting on the assumption that </p><p>the trip is to be made in a month or less. </p><p>In order to do that, it would only be neces- </p><p>sary to increase tile speed one and a quar- </p><p>ter feet per second each second; yet half </p><p>way to Jupiter the machine would be going</p><p>three hundred miles a second!” </p><p>It was my turn to whistle. </p><p>“But,” I objected, “a velocity like that </p><p>isn’t safe. Suppose it were to meet a rock </p><p>as large as ten feet in diameter. It wouldn’t </p><p>be visible in the telescope more than three </p><p>hundred miles away. That would leave </p><p>only one second to recognize it and change </p><p>course.” </p><p>“True,” said Wiley. “We’ll have to find </p><p>some other way of avoiding them.” </p><p>He dived into ihe log-book again, and pre- </p><p>sently came out with a new set of figures. </p><p>“If you were to use a larger acceleration </p><p>—say twenty feet per second per second— </p><p>you’d save a lot of energy, and get there </p><p>nearly as soon. In the first two and one </p><p>half million miles or so you’d reach a velo- </p><p>city of a hundred and fifty miles a second; </p><p>then you could shut off the power and coast </p><p>to within two and a half million miles of </p><p>Ganymede before slowing down. The work </p><p>done in reaching that speed would be only </p><p>about a fourth as much as in accelerating </p><p>all the way.” </p><p>“Still, a hundred and fifty miles a sec- </p><p>ond!” I exclaimed. “Two seconds to get </p><p>out of the way of obstructions three hun- </p><p>dred miles off! That would be an awful </p><p>strain on the pilot. He wouldn't dare bat </p><p>an eye; a single slip, and it would be all </p><p>over.” </p><p>“Yes,” admitted Wiley. “But yoiTve got </p><p>to get up a pretty good speed, or you’d take </p><p>too long in getting there. I wonder if some </p><p>sort of automatic device couldn’t be ar- </p><p>ranged lo steer the machine?” </p><p>He tilted back in his chair, felt around </p><p>for a bil of moon-grown tobacco, and filled </p><p>his pipe. Blowing a cloud of smoke, he </p><p>gazed into it absently. His fingers drum- </p><p>med on the desk; now and then he seized his </p><p>pencil, only to lay it down again. Finally </p><p>he jumped up. </p><p>“I’ll go see Langley,” he said. “He may </p><p>have some ideas. Two heads are usually </p><p>better than one on a job like this.” </p><p>HE departed, leaving me to while away </p><p>the time. There was a copy of Edgar </p><p>Allen Poe’s “Prose Tales” on our book </p><p>shelf, and 1 thumbed through the leaves in </p><p>search of something worth reading again. </p><p>“The Unparalleled Adventure of Hans </p><p>Pfaal” struck my eye, aud 1 smiled in recol- </p><p>lection of Poe’s idea of inhabitants of the </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>883 </p><p>moon, particularly the little fellow without </p><p>ears who had visited the earth in a balloon. </p><p>I wondered whether the Ganymedians would </p><p>resemble human beings in any way. Dr. </p><p>Forscher apparently thought not. But </p><p>wiiat other sort of creatures could possess </p><p>a high order of intelligence’ </p><p>I realized the futility of trying to ima- </p><p>gine the inhabitants of another world. There </p><p>was no foretelling the conditions under </p><p>which they had evolved—their food, their </p><p>enemies, their social life, the many obsta- </p><p>cles they must have surmounted in their up- </p><p>ward march. We could not know until the </p><p>trip to Ganymede was accomplished; and </p><p>that waited on Wiley’s ability to find a safe </p><p>mode of travel at enormous velocities. </p><p>Wiley came in, his face wreathed in </p><p>smiels. </p><p>“Excelsior!” he exclaimed. “Or is it </p><p>‘Eureka’? We have it. On to Ganymede!” </p><p>“Explain yourself,” I suggested. </p><p>“As I predicted, two heads are better than </p><p>one. Langley suggested a photo-electric </p><p>cell. You may have heard how sensitive </p><p>they are. I recall an example. Some in- </p><p>ventor built a machine for the purpose of </p><p>sorting beans, which made use of the differ- </p><p>ence in color of the bad ones and good ones. </p><p>There was a small lamp which shot a beam </p><p>of light on the beans as they passed along </p><p>on a conveyer belt. The white ones reflect- </p><p>ed enough light to keep the cell working, </p><p>but when a brown one came along the cur- </p><p>rent through the cell stopped, letting a trap </p><p>door fall open to drop out the undesirable </p><p>bean. Unfortunately, however, the machine </p><p>wasn't much good practically, at first, for it </p><p>detected beans with finger-prints or specks </p><p>of dust on them, and threw them out with </p><p>the bad ones.” </p><p>1 laughed. “But what has a bean sorter </p><p>got to do with Ganymede?” </p><p>“Suppose such an apparatus were placed </p><p>at the eyepiece of a telescope, and connected </p><p>to the controls of our space flyer so that it </p><p>would change its course whenever there was </p><p>a slight increase in the light ahead of us. </p><p>The meteors would betray themselves by the</p><p>sunlight falling on them, and our flyer </p><p>would be headed off out of danger.” </p><p>“Good enough!” I exclaimed. “That’s </p><p>the worst difficulty taken care of. Now we </p><p>can go ahead.” </p><p>“Wait a minute,” cautioned Wiley. “You </p><p>haven't heard it all yet. We can depend </p><p>on the photo-electric detector to pick up ob- </p><p>jects an inch or so in diameter, but the </p><p>smallest must hit the machine now and then. </p><p>The telescope lens would present quite a </p><p>large surface. Where are we to find an ob- </p><p>ject-glass strong enough lo withstand be- </p><p>ing hit by missiles as large as bullets at a </p><p>hundred and fifty miles a second?” </p><p>“Then why do you say ‘on to Gany- </p><p>mede’?” </p><p>“We have an idea, explained Wiley, </p><p>“though it is only an idea as yet. Langley </p><p>suggests that we make the photo-electric cell </p><p>sensitive to waves that will go right through </p><p>the hull of the flyer itself—high frequency </p><p>waves. We could generate them aboard the </p><p>tractor and project them ahead of us; then </p><p>when they struck a meteor some of them </p><p>would be reflected back to excite the cell. </p><p>1 think it can be done; if it is, we will </p><p>make plans for an expedition to Ganymede.” </p><p>The Comet </p><p>WILEY demonstrated once more the </p><p>genius which had aroused Dr. For- </p><p>scher’s admiration. After a month of ex- </p><p>perimenting he demonstrated the success of </p><p>his cell. He had set it up on the moon’s </p><p>surface, trained it on the sky and connected </p><p>to it a light, in such a way that a flash </p><p>would announce the operation of the cell. </p><p>We stood by and marveled as he tossed tiny </p><p>pebbles, filings of steel and such minute ob- </p><p>jects in the path of the rays, to be greeted </p><p>each time by a flash of the light. Without </p><p>a doubt the flyer would be safe from colli- </p><p>sions, at least. </p><p>From that time forward all eyes looked to </p><p>the day of departure of the expedition. The </p><p>construction of the flyer was begun, and </p><p>progressed rapidly. I assisted from time to </p><p>time in various capacities as far as my abil- </p><p>ities permitted. </p><p>Quaile had been given the task of map- </p><p>ping the best route from the moon to Gany- </p><p>mede, and I spent some time helping him. </p><p>We photographed the section of the sky </p><p>884 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>through which the machine would travel, </p><p>seeking unknown asteroids whose presence </p><p>might hinder our progress. There were a </p><p>number of them, yet the danger they repre- </p><p>sented was surprisingly small. All of them </p><p>were large enough to be picked up by the </p><p>detector while thousands of miles away; and </p><p>when one considers that if all the known </p><p>and imagined minor planets were added to- </p><p>gether they would not equal the moon in </p><p>volume, it is not difficult to realize that </p><p>they are too widely scattered to offer much </p><p>of an obstacle. Thus we decided on a </p><p>straight-line course, after allowing for mo- </p><p>tion of the earth and Jupiter in their orbits. </p><p>Meanwhile Jupiter and his attendants </p><p>were approaching opposition, at which point </p><p>they would reach a minimum distance of </p><p>three hundred and ninety million miles. </p><p>The construction of the machine was pushed </p><p>to the utmost in order to have it ready in </p><p>time for that favorable situation. Frequent </p><p>reports to Dr. Forscher announced the com- </p><p>pletion of this or that component part, and </p><p>the whole took shape as if by magic. </p><p>: Superhuman feats were accomplished, and </p><p>work which would have required months </p><p>under ordinary circumstances was done in </p><p>weeks. At each of my frequent visits to the </p><p>scene of the assembling I was amazed at the </p><p>progress. At first there was only the frame- </p><p>work, a long naked skeleton of steel; then </p><p>the covering appeared, section by section, </p><p>and was welded together in an unbroken, </p><p>shining armor. Generators, gyroscopes, </p><p>batteries, tanks, and piping took their places </p><p>in the interior, while the outside acquired </p><p>the dead-black gravity-screen, diminutive </p><p>wings and disappearing skids lo be used in </p><p>gliding through the atmosphere of Gany- </p><p>mede and landing on ihe ground. </p><p>In a time that seemed scarcely believable </p><p>the flyer was assembled, inspected, and </p><p>ready for a test. It was designed to carry </p><p>only five men, and those who had been most </p><p>instrumental in the building of it had the </p><p>honor of proving its ability. They were </p><p>Wiley, Dr. Langley, the chief chemist, ihe </p><p>chief of transportation, and Dr. Forscher </p><p>himself. Quaile and I, together with a </p><p>large crowd of onlookers stood by to watch. </p><p>Tbe machine rested horizontally on its skids,</p><p>a tiny stream of luminous vapor issuing </p><p>from the stern. The shining undersurface </p><p>contrasted sharply with the nearly invisible </p><p>black of the gravity-screen covering the </p><p>upper half. </p><p>The crew climbed aboard through an air- </p><p>lock below and disappeared. Shortly after- </p><p>ward the gravity screens slid into position, </p><p>the skids were withdrawn, and the vapor- </p><p>cloud grew in brightness, spurting out be- </p><p>hind. The machine paralleled the surface </p><p>for a short distance; then the rear end </p><p>dropped slightly, and it headed upward in </p><p>a long arc, pointing vertically upward and </p><p>receding into the blackness until only the </p><p>trailing streamer of gas was visible. High </p><p>above our heads it circled about, dodged </p><p>to right and left with ihe agility of a spar- </p><p>row, performed lightning-like maneuvers. </p><p>After a time it shot off toward the horizon, </p><p>dwindled to a tiny speck, and was lost to </p><p>sight. In a moment we sqw it returning: it </p><p>flashed among the stars, turned end for end, </p><p>and approached us stern first, retarding </p><p>gradually. With marvelous expertness it </p><p>diopped to the ground, shot out the landing- </p><p>skids, and came to rest a hundred yards </p><p>away. The passengers appeared, one by </p><p>one, from the air-lock and approached the </p><p>admiring group. </p><p>*&lt;VX7'HAT do y°u think of it?” asked </p><p>▼ V Wiley’s voice from one of the air- </p><p>envelopes. </p><p>“Wonderful,” replied Quaile. “Most </p><p>astounding! It looked like a comet gone </p><p>balmy!” Wiley laughed. </p><p>“A graphic illustration,” he said. “We </p><p>might give it a name.” </p><p>“77m.* Comet!'’ 1 agreed. “What would </p><p>be more appropriate than to name it for </p><p>the wanderers of die Solar System?” </p><p>The suggestion was immediately popular, </p><p>and forthwith the space-flyer received its </p><p>christening. </p><p>There now remained only the question of </p><p>who was to make the trip. The number </p><p>who wanted to go far exceeded the capacity </p><p>of the machine, and it appeared that Dr. </p><p>Forscher would have a delicate problem in </p><p>making the selection. He called an assem-</p><p>bly immediately, and there was a large gath- </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>885 </p><p>ering on hand in the hope of hearing them- </p><p>selves named among the lucky five. </p><p>“I realize fully the interest which this </p><p>journey to an unexplored world has </p><p>aroused,” began the doctor. “There are </p><p>many unique experiences in store for those </p><p>who undertake it. But I doubt if anyone </p><p>here realizes the danger involved. Were </p><p>it not for my own selfish haste to see it an </p><p>accomplished fact I should never permit the </p><p>Comet to leave the moon until it had been </p><p>thoroughly tested. But 1 have confidence </p><p>in the foresight and ability of its designers, </p><p>and in view of the satisfactory performance </p><p>on its trial vjoumey I believe that it may </p><p>reasonably be expected to reach its destina- </p><p>tion. </p><p>“Much will depend on the resourcefulness </p><p>of those who man it. however. They will </p><p>meet situations which cannot be foreseen, </p><p>and there is always the possibility that they </p><p>will never return. In view of that fact. I </p><p>cannot reasonably ask anyone to make the </p><p>journey who does not sincerely wish lo do </p><p>so.” He paused to give us an opportunity </p><p>to think the matter over, then resumed: “I </p><p>have selected five men as a crew. Any one </p><p>of them is at liberty to withdraw if he wish- </p><p>es. and 1 am sure he will not suffer in the </p><p>esteem of the rest. There is a disappoint- </p><p>ment in store for some of you. but I hope </p><p>you will see the matter as I do. </p><p>"There are three men present, all of whom </p><p>want very much to go, whom I must ask to </p><p>remain here. They are soon to assume the </p><p>leadership of this colony, and I do not con- </p><p>sider it wise to allow them to risk their </p><p>lives in this expedition. I refer to Dr. </p><p>Langley, Mr. Quaile and Mr. Wiley.” </p><p>1 looked around for the members of this </p><p>trio to see how they look the announcement. </p><p>Langley, who stood on the edge of the gath- </p><p>ering, betrayed no emotion whatsoever. </p><p>He looked steadily at the Doctor, his face </p><p>like a mask. Quaile semed surprised that </p><p>he had been considered for the expedition </p><p>at all, and was not upset by the announce- </p><p>ment. I reflected that the big telescope was </p><p>still a novelty for him. and he could content </p><p>himself with photographing the stars. </p><p>Wiley, however, was hard hit, for he had</p><p>counted heavily on making the trip. It </p><p>seemed a shame that he should not reap the </p><p>fruits of his efforts to make ihe trip possible, </p><p>but the Doctor was right. He could not </p><p>risk the loss of so valuable a man. </p><p>Dr. Forscher continued: “Those who make </p><p>up the party must be able to take a hand </p><p>in the operation of the machine, and must </p><p>use their time to the best advantage in gath- </p><p>ering facts about Ganymede and its inhabi- </p><p>tants. The primary object of tlie expedi- </p><p>tion is to get into communication with these </p><p>creatures who probably have nothing in </p><p>common with ourselves. The explorers will </p><p>find on Ganymede strange surroundings, un- </p><p>familiar social customs, even habits of </p><p>thought different from our own. They must </p><p>draw on imagination and reason, rather than </p><p>experience. </p><p>“With that in mind, I have chosen the five </p><p>men of the party. Dr. von Lichten, our </p><p>medfcal adviser, is the first. His training </p><p>will enable him to discover the constitution </p><p>of the Ganymedians, ihe processes of their </p><p>bodies, and their habits. Tlie second mem- </p><p>ber will be Dr. Ernst, whose ability as a </p><p>psychologist should help him to an under- </p><p>standing of their minds. M. Lafourchette, </p><p>the geologist and meteorologist, will exam- </p><p>ine the soil and climate of Ganymede. Mr. </p><p>Dalton is well known as a capable organic </p><p>chemist and has done notable work in zoo- </p><p>logy and botany in England. He will study </p><p>the flora and fauna of the satellite. And </p><p>to lake charge of the party while en route </p><p>and make a unified report of their adven- </p><p>tures and discoveries, a man who, while not </p><p>preeminently a scientist, has had no little </p><p>training in astronomy and physics and much </p><p>practical experience as a writer and explor- </p><p>er—Mr. George Marland!”	•</p><p>CHAPTER XII </p><p>The Trip Begins! </p><p>THE last announcement overwhelmed </p><p>me. The Doctor must surely have over- </p><p>rated my ability, to place me at the head of </p><p>the expedition. But I was immediately sur- </p><p>rounding by a group who seized my hands, </p><p>congratulating me on the coveted opportun- </p><p>ity. The olher members of the party were </p><p>886 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>similarly besieged by admirers who pound- </p><p>ed their backs and wrung their hands. Dr. </p><p>Forscher waited until the excitement had </p><p>died down a bit before adding his concluding </p><p>words. </p><p>“Jupiter is already three days past oppo- </p><p>sition; there is no time to lose. In forty- </p><p>eight hours the moon will be in a favorable </p><p>position for departure, and I ask these five </p><p>men to be ready to leave at that time. The </p><p>Cornet will be stocked with provisions at </p><p>once, and the members of the party will see </p><p>that their personal equipment is aboard. </p><p>That is all.” </p><p>Forty-eight hours allowed little enough </p><p>time to get ready for such an undertaking. </p><p>The five of us scarcely had a minute s rest. </p><p>Dr. v^tn Lichten pointed out a possibility </p><p>that had been heretofore overlooked—that </p><p>the atmosphere of Ganymede might contain </p><p>bacteria to which the human body was not </p><p>immune, in which case it would be danger- </p><p>ous to expose ourselves. He suggested that </p><p>rubber suits be constructed which would en- </p><p>able us to move about easily and talk to </p><p>the Ganymedians without exposing our- </p><p>selves, bul there was not time enough. Wil- </p><p>ey succeded in devising microphones which </p><p>could be attached to the air-envelopes, en- </p><p>abling us to hear sounds directly and make </p><p>ourselves heard, and these had to serve. </p><p>I had less baggage than any of the rest, </p><p>taking only a table of the positions of the </p><p>known bodies of the solar system and a large </p><p>supply of writing materials. I searched the </p><p>colony over for a typewriter, but there was </p><p>none to be found, and while it would not </p><p>have been difficult to make one the time </p><p>was too short. 1 contented myself with a </p><p>three-inch pile of paper, a dozen pens and </p><p>a quart of ink. </p><p>Meanwhile the moon pursued her course </p><p>around the earth, reaching the full phase on </p><p>schedule. We were on the far side, and con- </p><p>squently the terrain was wrapped in dark- </p><p>ness when our little party of five entered </p><p>the air-lock and shot to the surface. Quite </p><p>a few had braved the blackness and pene- </p><p>trating cold of the lunar night to see us off; </p><p>Dr. Forscher, Wiley and Quaile stood at the </p><p>air-lock of the Comet to bid us farewell with</p><p>a handshake and a word of encouragement. </p><p>Wiley’s voice was near breaking as he said: </p><p>“All the luck in the universe to you, old </p><p>man.” It wasn’t necessary to him to say </p><p>how terribly he wanted to go. </p><p>‘Til bring you a Ganymedian for a house- </p><p>pet,” I promised and climbed aboard. </p><p>The interior of the machine was divided </p><p>off into compartments from end to end </p><p>by heavy bulkheads. The various rooms </p><p>were cylindrical, connected by a ladder </p><p>along one wall, and were furnished with </p><p>tables, chairs, and bunks securely bolted to </p><p>the floor. The aspect was rather peculiar </p><p>at present, for the machine lay on its side </p><p>and the furniture appeared to hang from the </p><p>rear partition. We deposited our last-min- </p><p>ute impedimenta in the living quarters and </p><p>assembled in the engine-room. </p><p>The operation of the machine had been </p><p>explained to each man present, but I took </p><p>charge, having had experience with the trac- </p><p>tors. Under my direction they checked over </p><p>the readings of the various instruments, </p><p>closed the gravity screen and sent the gas </p><p>roaring behind us. We hung on desperate- </p><p>ly as the forward push of the acceleration </p><p>turned us upright in the room; then a shift </p><p>of the gyroscopes sent us curving upward </p><p>away from the moon, gaining speed rapidly. </p><p>I took sight of the stars through a peris- </p><p>cope at one side, heading the machine </p><p>straight for Jupiter. Once on our course a </p><p>non-magnetic compass indicated any deflec- </p><p>tion. Then we covered all the portholes </p><p>against ihe onslaught of meteorites, with- </p><p>drew the periscope and set the photo-elect- </p><p>ric detector working. This was connected </p><p>to the gyroscopes so that whenever it picked </p><p>up an obstruction in our path it shifted </p><p>them, sending us off at an angle to our </p><p>course; then after a few seconds it automa- </p><p>tically righted our direction. At the same </p><p>time a gong gave warning, so that we could </p><p>hang on to one of the many holds provided </p><p>and save ourselves from a fall. </p><p>DESPITE the absence of gravity we stood </p><p>firmly on the floor, for the push of the </p><p>driving gas held us down just as a quickly- </p><p>accelerated auto throws its occupants back- </p><p>ward. There was nothing more to do for</p><p>awhile except to watch the instruments. </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>887 </p><p>Our acceleration was plotted on a slowly </p><p>turning sheet of paper—the sort of appara- </p><p>tus used to record changes of temperature </p><p>by weather stations. It was actuated by a </p><p>weight on a spring, so that the downward </p><p>push of the acceleration moved a pen, and </p><p>any relaxation allowed the spring to draw </p><p>it back. In the first twenty-two hours we </p><p>would have covered two and one-half mil- </p><p>lion miles, and would then be traveling at </p><p>about one hundred and fifty miles per sec- </p><p>ond. From then on we would coast for </p><p>nearly a month at a velocity unchanged ex- </p><p>cept for dodging meteors, when the syn- </p><p>thium would be called into service for a few </p><p>seconds each time.* </p><p>During the first twenty-two hours we kept </p><p>a vigilant watch over the instrument board, </p><p>seeking-the slightest irregularity, but every- </p><p>thing functioned perfectly and except for an </p><p>occasional lurch sideways as we missed a </p><p>passing meteor there was nothing to break </p><p>the monotony. </p><p>I had been introduced to the members of </p><p>the party at the dinner-table sometime be- </p><p>fore, but until now we had become little ac- </p><p>quainted, and as I was in charge of the ex- </p><p>pedition during the journey I felt it was up </p><p>to me to discover what sort of men were </p><p>under my guidance. I took every oppor- </p><p>tunity to engage in conversation with each, </p><p>and soon learned that Dalton and Lafourch- </p><p>ette were not on the best of terms, having </p><p>published controversial theories on earth </p><p>concerning the importance of rainfall in </p><p>promoting the development of animals. </p><p>Physically they were almost exact opposites; </p><p>•It is a common impression that power must be </p><p>continually applied to maintain a constant speed. </p><p>One thinks of his automobile; if the engine is </p><p>stopped, the car will presently come to a stand- </p><p>still. But a reference to Newton's first law of </p><p>motion will explain the situation. Briefly it </p><p>states that a body in motion will continue in a </p><p>straight line indefinitely unless compelled to </p><p>alter its motion by some force acting on it. </p><p>In the case of the automobile there are always </p><p>forces at work; the resistance of the air and </p><p>the friction of its own moving parts against </p><p>each other or on the road. The faster the ear </p><p>goes, the greater this resistance becomes, until </p><p>the power applied by the motor just balances</p><p>the other forces, and a state of equilibrium i« </p><p>reached. But if the power is cut off, the re- </p><p>sisting forces tend to slow the car down until </p><p>it eventually stops. Out in space there were </p><p>no forces to retard us; the attraction of the </p><p>sun, moon and planets was cut off bv the </p><p>gravity screen, and even if it were not, its </p><p>effect would have been so minute as to be in- </p><p>distinguishable. </p><p>the Frenchman was short, dark, slender to </p><p>the point of emaciation, and possessed of a </p><p>nervous manner and a fiery temper, while </p><p>Dalton stood nearly six feet, a corpulent </p><p>red-faced man who look life casually. </p><p>As for the others, Dr. von Lichten, who </p><p>had resuscitated me after the incident of </p><p>Wiley’s and my capture, was taciturn and </p><p>inclined to keep lo himself, while Dr. Ernst, </p><p>the youngest of the lot, was the best mixer. </p><p>He was German by birth, of Hebrew extrac- </p><p>tion, and possessed a remarkable insight in- </p><p>to the human mind. I decided that I should </p><p>prefer his company to the squabbles of Dal- </p><p>ton and Lafourchette, or Dr. von Lichten’s </p><p>perpetual silence. </p><p>“Help!” </p><p>MEANWHILE the Comet flashed on </p><p>through the blackness with increasing </p><p>speed, leaving the moon far behind. We </p><p>arranged a schedule of watches in the en- </p><p>gine room, and those off duty stowei </p><p>their baggage and made themselves comfor- </p><p>table. There were provisions against the </p><p>month of travel ahead of us, such as playing </p><p>cards, chess men, and works of fiction which </p><p>had been borrowed for the trip. The jour- </p><p>ney promised to be tedious, for we must </p><p>travel absolutely blind, not daring to risk </p><p>leaving any of the port holes open. We </p><p>would miss many interesting sights, but we </p><p>consoled ourselves with the thought of those </p><p>which awaited us. </p><p>The two and a half million-mile point </p><p>was reached without incident; the power </p><p>was shut off, and we were suddenly free of </p><p>the pushing acceleration. Unavoidably we </p><p>floated off the floor, bumping against what- </p><p>ever happed to be over our heads. We hast- </p><p>ened to put on magnetic shoes like those </p><p>Wiley and I had used. Some of the party </p><p>were amused or disturbed over the weight- </p><p>less sensations at first, but quickly over- </p><p>came their annoyance.</p><p>Dalton was due for the next watch, and </p><p>presently looked at his time-piece and went </p><p>into ihe engine room. The door remained </p><p>open, and we heard his voice mingled with </p><p>Lafourchette’s voluble accents. I was about </p><p>888 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>to investigate when the Frenchman came </p><p>through the door, muttering. </p><p>“What’s wrong?” I asked anxiously. </p><p>“Nothing,” was the reply. “Monsieur </p><p>Dalton is anoyed because I see fit to take a </p><p>nap.” » </p><p>“But man, that’s dangerous!” I protested. </p><p>“Suppose something should go wrong while </p><p>you were asleep. We might all be killed!” </p><p>“That would be very bad,” yawned La- </p><p>fourchette. “1 am sorry; I shall be more </p><p>cautious in the future.” He rolled into bed </p><p>and was fast asleep in a few seconds. </p><p>We had been our way eleven days when </p><p>the little Frenchman’s second escapade </p><p>aroused our excitement. I noted with mild </p><p>curiosity that he had carried a mysterious </p><p>bundle with him to the control room. I </p><p>gave little heed at the time; but when, at </p><p>the end of his watch, I went lo relieve him, </p><p>he beckoned to me in evident excitemenl. </p><p>I closed the door and inquired what had </p><p>happened. </p><p>“I have made a great discovery!” he said. </p><p>“Bui we must keep it a secret between our- </p><p>selves, and let no one else take the credit. </p><p>“What is it?” 1 asked. </p><p>“The Fitzgerald contraction theory. I </p><p>have proved it false!” </p><p>“Then you've been making experiments </p><p>on it?” </p><p>He nodded. “I have brought with me the </p><p>most accurate micrometer in Dr. Forscher’s </p><p>laboratories. Before we left the moon I </p><p>measured several steel bars with great pre- </p><p>cision. Now we ate moving forward at the </p><p>rate of a hundred and fifty miles a second; </p><p>according to the contraction theory these </p><p>bars should be much shorter when they are </p><p>placed in the line of our motion, than when </p><p>they are at right angles to it. Vet lhat is </p><p>not the case. They are always the same </p><p>length!” </p><p>I suppressed a desire to laugh. </p><p>“My friend,” I said, “you overlook a sim- </p><p>ple fact. As you say, the Fitzgerald con-</p><p>traction theory states that a moving body </p><p>contracts in the direcion of its motion; and </p><p>it is true that your steel bars should be </p><p>shorter when you point them along our </p><p>course. But the theory does not exempt </p><p>micrometers; yours must also be shorter, </p><p>to the same extent, and of course you can- </p><p>not measure the contraction when you’re </p><p>measuring instrument is moving al the same </p><p>velocity.” </p><p>Lafourchette's lace fell. </p><p>“But then how can the contraction be </p><p>discovered?” he asked. </p><p>“You must make your measurements on </p><p>some body which is moving past us, or past </p><p>which we move. In either case you would </p><p>observe the contraction. The motion is on- </p><p>ly relative.” </p><p>“Then 1 can still do the experiment!” </p><p>said Lafourchctte joyfully. “I have a small </p><p>telescope with me. 1 will set it up in the </p><p>air lock, open the outside door, and look </p><p>al the planets past which we are sweeping. </p><p>Should ihey not appear distorted—contract- </p><p>ed sidewise?” </p><p>“They should,” I agreed. “We are en- </p><p>tering the region of the asteroids, and will </p><p>shortly pass close lo one of the largest. </p><p>The orbit of Pallas surrounds that of Mars, </p><p>and the asteroid itself is only a few million </p><p>miles from us.” </p><p>Lafourchelte rose. “1 shall examine it </p><p>al once,” he declared, and disappeared in </p><p>excitement. </p><p>I TURNED my attention to the controls. </p><p>As we were among the asteroids it was </p><p>important that our detector be kepi in per- </p><p>fect order, lo prevent hitting any of them. </p><p>Pallas lay many miles off our course, but </p><p>there was no telling how many fragments </p><p>of some miscarried world lay ahead of us. </p><p>Even al that moment the warning gong in- </p><p>dicated the proximity of one of them, and </p><p>the quick shift of the Comet’s direction </p><p>pitched me against the wall. </p><p>An hour or so later Ernst entered the con- </p><p>trol room. </p><p>“I’m worried about Lafourchette,” he</p><p>said. “He put on his envelope and went </p><p>into the air lock with a telescope. He </p><p>hasn't come back yet. Do you know what </p><p>he’s doing?” </p><p>“He wanted to make an experiment, </p><p>which he pledged me to keep a secret. </p><p>We’d best not interrupt him.” </p><p>“Nevertheless,” said Ernst, “I’m wor- </p><p>ried.” </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>889 </p><p>“We can talk to him with the radio of </p><p>one of the envelopes,” I suggested. “Just </p><p>ask him if he’s all right.” </p><p>Ernst put on one of the helmets and call- </p><p>ed Lafourchette’s name. I caught the fren- </p><p>zied response: </p><p>“Help!” </p><p>“What’s the matter?” </p><p>“Come quick! Mon Dizu, I cannot get </p><p>back!” </p><p>“Take the controls,” I said. “I’ll go see </p><p>what the trouble is.” I climbed into my </p><p>envelope, closed ihe outer door of the air- </p><p>lock and entered. Lafourchette was no- </p><p>where to be seen! Exhausting the air, I </p><p>reopened the outer port on an amazing spec- </p><p>tacle. Floating parallel to the Cornel, a </p><p>hundred feel away, Lafourchette was strug- </p><p>gling and kicking frantically in a vain effort </p><p>to pitch himself toward the air lock. </p><p>“I’ll throw you a rope!” I called, and </p><p>banging the port shut I heaved mightily on </p><p>the inner door. It would not give until I </p><p>had equalized the pressures, and I was </p><p>forced to wail until enough air had hissed </p><p>in through the valves. Inside, I set about </p><p>a frenzied search for a coil of rope, finally </p><p>unearthing a stretch of stout metal cord. I </p><p>fastened one end about my waist and re- </p><p>turned to the air lock. Lafourchette had </p><p>calmed his struggles somewhat. </p><p>“Catch this!” I shouted, heaving the coil </p><p>into the blackness. But I had unconscious- </p><p>ly thrown high to allow for gravity, as on </p><p>earth. The cord missed him by twenty feet, </p><p>remained stretched snakily and refusing to </p><p>come closer. I hauled in and tried again, </p><p>this time with better success. Lafourch- </p><p>ette seized the free end and I pulled him </p><p>aboard. He was on the verge of collap- </p><p>sing, whether from fright or exposure to the </p><p>intense cold 1 could not tell. I carried him </p><p>inside, where we stripped off his envelope. </p><p>He gasped violently several times. </p><p>“What happened?” we demanded in </p><p>chorus. </p><p>“I went out lo look at the asteroid,” he </p><p>said, struggling for breath. “Suddenly the </p><p>bell sounded, and the Comet swung side- </p><p>wise. I had no chance to catch something </p><p>for a hold; the machine just floated from </p><p>under me, and I was left in space. A little </p><p>later the Comet straightened out and sailed </p><p>right along beside me. I tried to kick my- </p><p>self back, to swim, anything at all, but it </p><p>was in vain. Ah, my friends, the aggrava- </p><p>tion of it! There was I, a hundred feet </p><p>away, yet unable to come any closer. Then, </p><p>lo	make matters worse, the air pressure in</p><p>my envelope began to fall. I was nearly </p><p>suffocated when you threw the rope. The </p><p>fabric must have burst somewhere.” </p><p>I looked over his flexible covering care- </p><p>fully, but could find no break. Dr. von </p><p>Lichten picked up ihe helmet, and emitted </p><p>a whistle. </p><p>“Look at this!” he exclaimed. “A hole </p><p>clear through both front and back. You </p><p>hit a tiny stone, my friend, which would </p><p>have drilled you more neatly than a bullet </p><p>had it touched your body. You may indeed </p><p>thank your lucky stars that you are still </p><p>with us.” </p><p>“That is whal I do not understand,” said </p><p>Lafourchette. “With ihe machine speeding </p><p>along at one hundred and fifty miles per </p><p>second, why was I not left behind?” </p><p>“When you fell overboard,” I said, “you, </p><p>loo, were going a hundred and fifty miles </p><p>per second. There was nothing to stop you </p><p>—no air, no gravity; you just kept on go- </p><p>ing. You could have floated beside us in- </p><p>definitely, unless the Comet swung away </p><p>again.” </p><p>“Then my telescope is still beside us?” </p><p>he asked. </p><p>“Unless it was hit by the meteor which </p><p>caused the Comet to dodge. Shall I try to </p><p>get it for you?” </p><p>“No,” said Lafourchette. “Let us take no </p><p>more risks outside the machine. Besides, </p><p>1 have seen all I wanted to.” </p><p>“Did you find the contraction?” </p><p>“No! Thai accursed asteroid was per- </p><p>fectly round!” </p><p>“Perhaps we can estimate how much of a </p><p>contraction ihere should have been,” I said, </p><p>figuring on the back of an envelope. “At </p><p>our velocity, Pallas’ disc should have ap- </p><p>890 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>peared out of shape by about three parts in </p><p>ten million.”* </p><p>“Then I could not have seen it, after all,” </p><p>said Lafourchette sadly. </p><p>“True. In order for the contraction to </p><p>become appreciable, our velocity would have </p><p>to be comparable to the speed of light. </p><p>That is why it is so hard to believe the </p><p>FiUgerald equation. If we see a railroad </p><p>train rush past without appearing a bit </p><p>shorter, we are apt to say to ourselves: </p><p>‘This contraction business is the bunk!’ ” </p><p>Lafourchette had regained his normal </p><p>composure. ‘‘At any event,” he said, “I </p><p>have learned a lesson. I shall stick to my </p><p>own science, and refrain from questioning </p><p>theories which have been developed by </p><p>competent physicists until T am sure of the </p><p>ground I stand on—scientifically and per- </p><p>sonally.” </p><p>The days went on, marked only by the </p><p>revolutions of our clock. Each passing hour </p><p>reeled off half a million miles, eating up </p><p>the distance to our destination. Mv calcu- </p><p>Irtions showed that we had only a few mil- </p><p>lion more lo go. 1 decided it would be </p><p>safer to begin slowing down a little ahead </p><p>of time, to allow a margin of safety. Our </p><p>terrific speed made it unsafe to use the </p><p>periscope, for a grain of dust such as had </p><p>pierced Lafourchette's helmet would wreck </p><p>it. and interplanetary space was more or </p><p>less filled with such particles. After figur- </p><p>ing our position as accurately as possible </p><p>by dead reckoning, I allowed a million miles </p><p>to spare. None of the satellites would bar </p><p>our path, but Jupiter lay dead ahead, and </p><p>we had no desire to plunge into his atmos- </p><p>phere. After slowing down to a safe speed </p><p>we could take observation and alter our </p><p>course so as to meet Ganymede at the proper </p><p>time. </p><p>Nearing Jupiter </p><p>THE hour of starting up the driver would </p><p>come during Lafourchette’s watch. I </p><p>offered to stand it as well as my own, but </p><p>he insisted on taking his turn. Dalton had </p><p>referred to him as “sleepyhead” since his </p><p>first offense and his pride was hurt. Ac-</p><p>cordingly 1 set about writing up the log </p><p>of our journey. Dr. von Lichten was asleep </p><p>in his bunk, and Dalton and Ernst were at </p><p>one of their innumerable chess games, hav- </p><p>ing “loaded” the board and the chess-men </p><p>with magnetized iron so that they would </p><p>remain in place, despite the lack of gravity. </p><p>This last circumstance made my writing </p><p>difficult, for 1 had to lean against the wall, </p><p>and my ink showed a great disinclination </p><p>to slay in the bottle/ To add to my dis- </p><p>comfiture I found myself unable to collect </p><p>my thoughts. I wrote a word, crossed it out, </p><p>and re-wrote it, unable to make up my </p><p>mind. I became increasingly drowsy, and </p><p>finally fell into a doze. </p><p>1 awakened with a hazy realization that </p><p>the gong connected to the detector had rung. </p><p>My head must have knocked sharply against </p><p>the wall, though the throb of the blow seem- </p><p>ed far off and unimportant. My glance fell </p><p>idly on Ernst and Dalton, standing at </p><p>grotesque angles sound asleep beside their </p><p>chessboard. The spectacle was amusing, </p><p>but slowly I realized that something must </p><p>be done. With painful slowness I dragged </p><p>my feet into the engine-room, and found </p><p>Lafourchette blissfully unconscious. I </p><p>peered drunkenly at the instrument board, </p><p>my befogged brain unable to fathom the </p><p>meaning of the many indicators. Slowly I </p><p>grasped the fact that the air was horribly </p><p>foul. I struggled toward the emergency </p><p>oxygen tank and wrestled with the valve un- </p><p>til it gave, pouring the life-giving gas into </p><p>the room. Standing near the tank I inhaled </p><p>deeply, and soon recovered my strength. </p><p>Then I grabbed Lafourchette by the shoul- </p><p>ders and dragged him to the valve. It was </p><p>a minute or so before he recovered con- </p><p>sciousness. protesting that he had been asleep </p><p>only a moment. 1 looked at the clock. We </p><p>should have begun slowing up two hours </p><p>ago! </p><p>Yelling directions at Lafourchette, I set </p><p>the gyroscopes turning and reversed the </p><p>•The equation for the FiUgerald contraction is </p><p>V 3~-2 </p><p>Ij - Lo	c2 Ij represents the length of</p><p>the body In motion, Lo the length of that body</p><p>at rest, v the velocity of the body when in mo- </p><p>tion (or the relative velocity between the body </p><p>and the observer), and c. the velocity of light. </p><p>PutUng these values in the equation, it becomes </p><p>L-Lo V t -	which comes out</p><p>.9999997 it Lo, a contraction of .0000003. </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>891 </p><p>Comet. In another second the gas was </p><p>shrieking through the discharge tube, the </p><p>sudden acceleration sending me to my </p><p>knees. We rushed into the living room, to </p><p>find Ernst and Dalton sprawled on the par- </p><p>tition and Dr. von Lichten half out of his </p><p>bunk with his feet tangled in the covers. We </p><p>disentangled them and hauled them into the </p><p>engine-room. There, lying by the wide open </p><p>oxygen valve, they quickly recovered con- </p><p>ciousness, asking in great bewilderment </p><p>what had happened. I exclaimed briefly </p><p>that the oxygen apparatus had got out of </p><p>order, and the bad air had rendered us all </p><p>unconscious. Dalton raised up and pointed </p><p>an accusing finger at Lafourchette. </p><p>“Sleepyhead!” he shouted. “Dreaming </p><p>on the job again. No thanks to you that </p><p>we’re all not dead now!’ </p><p>“From those unmentionable cigars of </p><p>yours,” retorted the Frenchman, “it is a </p><p>wonder we have not been asphyxiated be- </p><p>fore!” </p><p>I intervened, to stop further argument. </p><p>“We are going too fast for safety,” I </p><p>said, “with Jupiter less than two and a half </p><p>million miles away. I've had to reverse the </p><p>Comet by dead reckoning. The detector </p><p>isn’t turned around yet, so we are unpro- </p><p>tected from collisions. I’ll have to take a </p><p>chance on using the periscope to get our </p><p>bearings.” </p><p>This was a risky proceeding, though the </p><p>streamer of gas rushing out ahead of us </p><p>offered some protection against small dust </p><p>fragments floating in space. I uncovered </p><p>the tube and extended il enough to get a </p><p>view of the path ahead of us. </p><p>For a few seconds the flaming streamer </p><p>of gas from the disintegrating synthium </p><p>blinded me. Then, through- the brilliant </p><p>blue-yellow haze, I caught a glimpse of </p><p>something which froze ray stomach—a shin- </p><p>ing circle! </p><p>In one bound I reached the gyroscope </p><p>controls and swung the Comet off at a </p><p>tangent. The others had sensed my panic </p><p>and stood motionless. Five—ten—fifteen</p><p>seconds passed; nothing happened. I re- </p><p>turned to the periscope just in time to see </p><p>the pitted surface of one of Jupiter’s tiny </p><p>outer satellites sweep past, seemingly only </p><p>a stone’s throw away. In reality we had </p><p>missed it by a mile or more; yet our ter- </p><p>rific speed reduced that distance to a hun- </p><p>dredth of a second in time. By so small a </p><p>margin had we missed ending our journey </p><p>prematurely, a tangled mass of heated metal, </p><p>against a pigmy member of the Jovian sys- </p><p>tem, so small as to be visible from earth </p><p>only in the very largest telescopes. </p><p>Incongruously enough, I roared in half- </p><p>hysterical laughter. The wave of relief </p><p>which swept over me reduced me to useless- </p><p>ness for the moment, but Dr. von Lichten </p><p>retained the presence of mind to swing the </p><p>beam of high-frequency waves which actu- </p><p>ated ihe detector ahead of us, thereby pre- </p><p>venting the possibility of another such en- </p><p>counter. Then 1 looked out again, to </p><p>straighten out our course. </p><p>Jupiter lay off to the right, with Gany- </p><p>mede beyond, moving majestically along in </p><p>its orbit. Now that we had our bearings </p><p>once more, we could change our course so </p><p>as to meet it at the far side of its path, </p><p>heading close to Jupiter on the way. I </p><p>explained the situation and told the others </p><p>of my decision. Then we made sure that </p><p>the gravity-screens were in position and the </p><p>portholes all tight, for it would not do to </p><p>expose ourselves to Jupiter's attraction at </p><p>the short distance we would pass him. We </p><p>agreed that for the rest of the trip two of </p><p>us would always be present in the engine </p><p>room, and Dalton and I volunteered for the </p><p>first shift. </p><p>It was not necessary for both of us to </p><p>watch the instrument board constantly, so I </p><p>took the first turn. Between us we were to </p><p>stand an eight-hour watch, during which </p><p>time we would rcach our minimum distance </p><p>from Jupiter. The realization of that fact </p><p>kept me constantly alert for the slightest </p><p>variation in the instruments, but there was </p><p>none. We continued our rapidly slackening </p><p>flight, rushing toward our destination, near- </p><p>ing the belted planet around which Gany- </p><p>mede revolves. At the end of four hours </p><p>Dalton relieved me and I set about record- </p><p>ing the latest incidents. </p><p>892 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>CHAPTER XIII </p><p>Signs of Danger </p><p>WE must have been about half a mil- </p><p>lion miles from Jupiter’s surface when </p><p>Dalton remarked: </p><p>“The acceleration indicator’s a little </p><p>high.” </p><p>1 walked over to the instrument board </p><p>for a look. We were slowing down a little </p><p>too much; the needle had risen two-tenths </p><p>of a foot per second on the scale. </p><p>“No harm in a little deviation like that,” </p><p>I remarked, as I slipped the controlling </p><p>rheostat into the next notch and resumed </p><p>my place.

The thermometer’s up </p><p>three degrees.” </p><p>“Probably from the extra heal of the </p><p>driver,” I suggested. </p><p>In the next few minutes all the instru- </p><p>ments began to misbehave slightly,. The </p><p>gyroscope compass indicated that we were </p><p>a fraction of a degree off our course, to- </p><p>ward Jupiter; the temperature continued to </p><p>rise; the photo-electric detector went into </p><p>action with remarkable persistence, shift- </p><p>ing our direction about continuously and at </p><p>random, and the acceleration crept up </p><p>again. </p><p>These disorders were no serious but they </p><p>were unexpected and disturbing, f urther- </p><p>more, when 1 again cut down the accelera- </p><p>tion I realized that the sound of the gas </p><p>had unquestionably diminished from its </p><p>usual note. The synthium was not over- </p><p>working; some other force was holding us </p><p>back! The temperature of the interior rose </p><p>until we had to shut off the electric heaters; </p><p>the detector sent us skipping about with</p><p>alarming frequency, and our course tended </p><p>more and more toward Jupiter. Could it </p><p>be that his atmosphere extended as far out </p><p>as this, and that we were encountering its </p><p>outer limits? That would account for the </p><p>heal of the Comet and the increased retard- </p><p>ing. </p><p>As we approached our nearest point to </p><p>Jupiter it became apparent that this was </p><p>not the explanation. The detector misbe- </p><p>haved so badly that we were forced to shut </p><p>il	off at the risk of a collision, while all the</p><p>electrical apparatus acted queerly. There </p><p>were strange noises from the headgear of the </p><p>air-envelopes, due to the static disturbances </p><p>broadcast by their receivers. Even without </p><p>the electric heaters the temperature inside </p><p>the machine rose steadily; the acceleration </p><p>continued to increase, and our course had </p><p>to be constantly corrected to prevent our </p><p>heading straight for Jupiter. </p><p>The simple explanation of these phenom- </p><p>ena dawned on me in a burst of compre- </p><p>hension. We were in a strong magnetic </p><p>field! Nor was I too long in discovering </p><p>its source. The earth, three hundred times </p><p>less massive than Jupiter, has an easily re- </p><p>cognized field which has been used for cen- </p><p>turies to guide mankind by its effect on the </p><p>compass needle. In view of Jupiter’s great </p><p>size, was it surprising that he should have </p><p>a field many times stronger? Given that, </p><p>the electrical and other phenomena follow- </p><p>ed as a natural consequence. </p><p>Let us refer for a moment to the effect </p><p>of moving a metallic conductor near a mag- </p><p>net. Under certain circumstances there </p><p>will be a current induced in the conductor, </p><p>and according to the law of Lenz, this cur- </p><p>rent tends to oppose the inducing influence. </p><p>There is a simple rule for remembering the </p><p>relation of these effects. Extend the right </p><p>hand with the index finger straight ahead, </p><p>the thumb vertical and the middle finger </p><p>pointing to ihe left. The middle finger in- </p><p>dicates the direction of motion, the thumb </p><p>that of the magnetic field, and the index </p><p>finger the flow of current from positive to </p><p>negative. The shell of the Comet was a </p><p>good conductor of electricity, and the in- </p><p>duced currents, eddying through it, opposed </p><p>our motion, expending their energy in </p><p>slowing us down and heating up the inter-</p><p>ior. The wiring of the detector experienced </p><p>a similar flow of current, which sent us </p><p>dodging hither and thither, while the ir- </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>893 </p><p>regularities of the field announced their </p><p>presence in the squawking radios. </p><p>‘This is about as close as we’ll get,” an- </p><p>nounced Dalton from the instrument-board. </p><p>We were just outside the orbit of Io; the </p><p>magnetic disturbance had reached its </p><p>height. In a flash of inspiration 1 saw the </p><p>answer to the puzzling heat of the satellites. </p><p>They too experienced Jupiter’s strong field; </p><p>they were doubtless able to conduct electric- </p><p>ity as well as the earth; the vast eddy-cur- </p><p>rents in their interiors must give rise to high </p><p>temperatures which could not have other- </p><p>wise existed. </p><p>Ernst and von Lichten, who presently re- </p><p>lieved us, had noted the behavior of the </p><p>Cornet, arid were considerably upset. But </p><p>my explanation set their fears at rest and </p><p>they accepted my prediction that the annoy- </p><p>ing situation would disappear as we drew </p><p>pagt Jupiter. </p><p>When my next turn in the pilot-house </p><p>came, we were moving slowly enough to </p><p>permit use of the periscope without danger. </p><p>Ganymede lay to our right, a brilliant, </p><p>dazzling moon.

Is uranium a radioactive metal?</p><p>2.	What is tin' actual speed of sound?</p><p>3.	How would you disintegrate an atom and what</p><p>would be the method of application, say to n steam </p><p>bo.tt ? </p><p>Albert \\ iggin, </p><p>1514 Wayne Aye., </p><p>Lakewood. Ohio. </p><p>&lt;1. Uranium is one of the most radio-acthe of met- </p><p>als. Like radium, uranium disintegrates almost fip n- </p><p>taneously, though slowly, into alpha and beta parti- </p><p>cles and lea\ es lead as a remainder. It also shoots </p><p>off into space a* a result of the disintegration, as does </p><p>radium, the short gamma rajs. </p><p>2.	The speed of sound varies in the different med-</p><p>iums. About 1100 feet per second may be accepted </p><p>as a fair average' value in air. </p><p>3.	Many methods have been proposed for disinte-</p><p>grating the atom. Some scientists propose to speed </p><p>up the electrons so that they shall Anally acquire</p><p>enough of a peed to bieak loose fiom the proton; </p><p>others want to use a physical contact, by bombarding </p><p>the atom with tree electrons und so knocking some of </p><p>the electrons loose; others want to cause the disinte- </p><p>gration by pulling the proton out of its atom. </p><p>The latest theories however indicate that the re- </p><p>lease of atomic energy will not come from the dis- </p><p>ruption of the atom. Millikan and others believe that </p><p>it will require Just as much energy to disrupt the </p><p>atom as it would provide. Millikan states that ato- </p><p>mic energy is released by the building up of one kind </p><p>of atoms from others.

There are likewise several buildings, which are </p><p>now being equipped with machinery, so that next year </p><p>we can work on a very large scale. </p><p>In the meantime important rocket experiments have </p><p>been performed by the technicians of the Society, the </p><p>engineers Ncbel and Kiedel—experiments dealing with </p><p>the combustion of liquid fuels (gasoline) with liquid </p><p>oxygen; experiments on the ignition of liquid rockets; </p><p>on the stabilizing of rockets in flight; on the arrang- </p><p>ing of the fuel chambers, and on the rocket parachute, </p><p>which brings the burned out rocket safely back to </p><p>earth. </p><p>It is a great pleasure for us to be able to say that </p><p>all these experiments, despite their great difficulty, have </p><p>been successful. Ignition, stabilizing and the releas- </p><p>ing of the parachute were problems which came out </p><p>successfully with our experimental apparatus.

Ha, ha, ha. </p><p>Harry Puneoast, </p><p>306 \V, 28 St., </p><p>Wilmington, Del. </p><p>Frankly, wo have received very few* letters of criti- </p><p>cism on the new size and shape of WOSDER STORIES. </p><p>If there was any criticism at all, it was that some </p><p>readers objected to the rough edges. This, too, is sur- </p><p>prising because actually by count over OS1., of the </p><p>so called pulp magazines on the newsstands in tho </p><p>small size are with rough edges. </p><p>Tho reason for this is purely a mechanical one </p><p>and it lias been accepted as a standard in pulp pub- </p><p>lishing practice. </p><p>The extra cost in giving smooth edges is so trifling </p><p>that we have decided with the February issue to </p><p>adopt the smooth edges inasmuch ns a number of </p><p>our readers seem to like ibis slvle better. The extra </p><p>eost tor the eniire edition is less than $100 00 and </p><p>we gladly contribute ibis amount, even if only a </p><p>few readers have voiced their displeasure with the </p><p>rough edges. </p><p>As to the paper, we believe we use as good or more </p><p>expensive grade of paper Ilian any of the pulp paper </p><p>magazines. </p><p>As for the quality of the printing, we" are spend- </p><p>ing an average of from eight to ter. percent more </p><p>to get better printing not only on the inside but </p><p>cn the outside as well. </p><p>So much for shop talk. </p><p>As to the paragraph where our correspondent </p><p>claims that the pages jump suddenly from 7:12 to </p><p>764, he simply voices an ignorance of the production </p><p>of magazines in general. All magazines are made up </p><p>in what is known ns signatures of either 32 or 61</p><p>pages. These are gathered by a gathering machine </p><p>which is supposed not to make any mistakes, but </p><p>even machines are not infallible and sometimes it </p><p>happens that due to a variation of the paper or for </p><p>other mechanical reasons a signature, that is, « group </p><p>of 32 pages, is dropped, or a signature is duplicated. </p><p>This happens with all magazines, but it is rather an </p><p>infrequent occurrence. Any render who gets a muti- </p><p>lated copy that has duplicated signatures or has </p><p>pages missing knows that his newsdealer will give </p><p>him another copy in exchange, free of charge.

Commun- </p><p>istic would have served the purpose just as well. Tho </p><p>word seems to be like the pseudo-adverb "electronical- </p><p>ly."

Jones, </p><p>1-7 Greenwood St. </p><p>Tamaqua, I’enna. </p><p>(We aro afraid that Mr. Jones missed the point of </p><p>Mr. Nathanson’s satire in 'The Falling Planetoid." </p><p>Mr, Nalhanson's whole point in his story was to show </p><p>that even when faced with a universal catastrophe, tho </p><p>nations of the earth could not forget their suspicions,</p><p>jealousies, petty selfishness and bickering. He want- </p><p>led to show that from the point of view of Englishmen, </p><p>the people of Russia were probably "commu nistieally- </p><p>tninled wretches" and that these "wretches" did not </p><p>care if the English were wiped ont. The Chinese </p><p>likewise, were quite satisfied that the Russians should </p><p>be eliminated very gently from the face of the earth. </p><p>Ilis whole point therefore was to show us that national </p><p>psychology does not. change even when every nation </p><p>is face with utter destruction. We believe, therefore, </p><p>that stories like his serve a very useful purpose in re- </p><p>vealing to us our own stupidity. </p><p>Unfortunately it would be difficult to properly judge </p><p>the merits of space flyers without, a great deal of tech </p><p>nieal discussion and thought.

T guess </p><p>all of these things are none of my *!:$!! business, </p><p>but I thought. I'd just suggest them and let you do </p><p>what you please with them. </p><p>In my criticisms, fine will mean that Ihe story was </p><p>extremely interesting and one that I enjoyed through- </p><p>out; good will mean that the story kept my interest</p><p>most of the way; passable will mean that the story w»s </p><p>merely good enough to pass the time with but I didn't </p><p>care for it particularly; poor is self explanatory. </p><p>“The Time Annihilator."

He does not waste words nor does he </p><p>try to flatter or “lambast" us. His judgment is un- </p><p>prejudiced, so say what he will, we are glad to get it. </p><p>The record for the November issue according to Mr. </p><p>Waite gives ns two "fines ', three 'goods” and one- </p><p>well one that he didn’t care for—as was evident. </p><p>From such ail astute critic we are inclined to accept </p><p>this as a sign tl at the issue was pretty good. </p><p>We disagree with him however on the lack of science </p><p>in ''Lords of the Deep' . The question of the relics </p><p>of Raster Island is one with as many scientific impli- </p><p>cations as that of the geologic past of the race. How- </p><p>ever we are inclined to agree with him on one point. </p><p>We think that the word "wonder" should suggest things </p><p>of the future rather than those of ihe past, and our </p><p>aim is lo print principally stories that turn the mind </p><p>forward into the future. </p><p>However we invite Mr. Waite lo send us his com- </p><p>ment each month.

I contend </p><p>that it is impossible for one to even think that in the </p><p>future "time travelling" machines will be invented </p><p>that will transport one through time to the future,</p><p>sav 1000 years—and my wife says'that it will be pos- </p><p>sible to do so. In my opinion it makes good and in- </p><p>structive reading, but it will always be a dream to </p><p>the authors. My wife says it is possible tor it to be- </p><p>come a reality.

Yet as a duty to science, as well as </p><p>science fiction, we must answer Mr. Barrie. </p><p>Suppose we take ourselves back three thousand years </p><p>or more to the days of the biblical prophets and tried </p><p>to describe to them a television machine, or a radio or </p><p>an electric dvnamo. The people of that time might not </p><p>even have been able to conceive of what we meant, </p><p>not- alone picturing the instruments we were speaking </p><p>about. How then ran we. with any finality, picture </p><p>adequately what the scientific attainments of the future </p><p>will be! We are slill but children peering ahead in </p><p>a dimly lighted world of science. We see a few things, </p><p>and men of rare genius see a little further than we. </p><p>But who can really see five hundred, a Ihousand or five </p><p>thousand years ahead? </p><p>The best that we of mortal minds can do is to say </p><p>to these questions. "I don't know." To us time </p><p>travelling must first be proved a scientific possibility; </p><p>then it must be proved that a machine can be built to </p><p>make use of that possibility. But possible or not. the </p><p>time travelling machine provides the fascinating means </p><p>of projecting ourselves into the future and seeing whal </p><p>the world will be like then.

If one </p><p>■ omcs up againM a word of doubtful meaning it is </p><p>always helpful to dig down to bedrock as to its r-ul </p><p>meaning. Now tripe is a very useful and necessary </p><p>component of certain animals and is neither bright, </p><p>clever er brilliant. But for its functions, which are </p><p>all hard work and no play, it deserves respect.

There arc people in every class </p><p>and occupation of life who think they can get </p><p>something for nothing, who think they can put some- </p><p>thing over on other people, who are not fundamen- </p><p>tally honest. </p><p>Among tho^e I reckon priests who preach with their </p><p>tongues in their cheek, physicians who made drug ad- </p><p>dicts, to whom the bill is the most important object; </p><p>real estate dealers who sell shady real estate; tailors </p><p>who sell shoddy for wool; auto mechanics who skimp </p><p>their work; food dealers who sell putrid meat, china </p><p>clay for flour and sand for sugar; wives who set </p><p>their own pleasure above the weal of their family; </p><p>husbands who spend their earnings on themselves; </p><p>employers who sweat their employees and employees </p><p>who don't do an honest day’s work: nnd so on.

Published by Independent Publish- </p><p>ing Company, New Rochelle, N. Y. Price </p><p>$1.00. </p><p>Mr. Salisbury presents us with a new type of social </p><p>satire using the 'familiar device of pushing his charac- </p><p>ter iuto lilt- future, into a completely mechanized social- </p><p>ized slate. At least the customs and the liabits of th." </p><p>people have become mechanized. It is a world filled </p><p>with square-headed people, whose whole social out- </p><p>look is bounded by tilt square. They must walk in </p><p>groups of four, speak in blank verse, with phrases ol </p><p>four words, and in every social custom tlie number </p><p>four must be predominant. To the reviewer ihe device </p><p>is an unfortunate one, for once started it- must be </p><p>maintained by ihe author. It quickly becomes boring. </p><p>We tee ourselves of the present day exposed by tho </p><p>author in all our narrowmindedness, hypocrisy, and </p><p>insistence upon uniformity in our lives lo the exclu </p><p>sion of that individuality that makes for social pro </p><p>grcss. </p><p>There are bootleggers in tho future as iu the present </p><p>and there are policemen who /or a consideration will </p><p>wink at "wrongdoings." </p><p>Marriage is by eugenics in this model world, and our </p><p>time traveler must perforce marry a tquareheaded </p><p>beauty because her characteristics arc eugenicallv </p><p>mated to his own. </p><p>'As a social satire there is not much that is original </p><p>in ihe method and execution of this look. But all -jeh </p><p>satires have their place—for only by moans of them </p><p>can we become aware of our follies, our stupidities </p><p>and our weaknesses and in effect "see ourselves as </p><p>others see us." </p><p>THE MAN WHO MASTERED TIME by </p><p>Ray Cummings, 350 pages, stiff cloth </p><p>covers, size 5x8. Published by A. C. </p><p>McClurg and Company, Chicago. Price </p><p>$2.00. </p><p>Ray Cummings as a teller of unusual stories has </p><p>one of the qualities, at least, of H. &lt;3. Wells. Neither </p><p>of these writer* of science fiction presents an unusual </p><p>situation to a reader and say, “Here, this is true I</p><p>Believe it or not, it really happened I" Instead, their </p><p>method is more subtle, or rather more insidioas. They </p><p>do not ask for belief, instead by carefully planned </p><p>hints, by suggestion, by little personal word pictures, </p><p>by their own doubts as the reoounter of the tales, </p><p>they prepare Ihe reader for the startling fact that is </p><p>about to be revealed. So when it comes the reader s </p><p>resistance has been removed and he finds himself </p><p>believing. </p><p>That quality of Cummings is nowhere more in evi </p><p>deuce than in the present volume. Although today, </p><p>readers of science fiction are accustomed, more or less, </p><p>to the adventures of time travelers, the firs! publica- </p><p>tion of ibis story must have had to combat the pre- </p><p>judice aroused by the mere idea in it. Travel into </p><p>the future or past!" Ihe average man probably grunt- </p><p>ed. "Absurd 1 </p><p>Yet Cummings makes his story and his characters </p><p>Bo human, and their efforts so filled with human error* </p><p>that we cannot bill admit at least, that time travell- </p><p>ing might be accomplished. </p><p>The young Loto Rogers travels 20,000 years into </p><p>the future and sees ,i new human race—physically </p><p>degenerate, with a new savagery yet with a greater </p><p>science than we possess. Perhaps the strange events </p><p>of that age would have had no meaning for him, but </p><p>there was a girl ... so Loto must return to </p><p>hiB own time for help and then return to the future </p><p>to take his part in that stirring drama of "hate, </p><p>greed and lust."
