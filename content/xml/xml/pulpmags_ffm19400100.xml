He feared, you see.</seg><seg type="columnLine">that by this time the old methods of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasing fortunes would be done away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with, and that if the estate were sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided from generation to generation it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would at last disappear altogether.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So he provided that, if personal for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunes were still allowed by law, the Priest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley name and prestige would be preserved</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the living members of the family so</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished.

Professor Fleckner had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned off the ray and blotted out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene of tragedy.

It was as though they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly awakened from a terrible night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mare. Then from about the room rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stir and a sigh of relief--the kind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes to an awakening sleeper when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">realizes that after all it was only a dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so it was to these watchers of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">violent death over a thousand miles away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As soon as it dawned on them that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not really in the dread presence, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reality slipped from their imaginations</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it became merely as a vivid tale</seg><seg type="columnLine">lately read.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not so with Tom Priestley. His was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen sensibility and vivid imagination.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The horror still lived before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt that just behind that screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">still lay those two lifeless forms, and above</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the shrieking woman holding poiged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dripping knife. Tom shuddered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he jumped up. This was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision. Two real human beings had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">blotted out. Another had just com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted an awful act.

On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen before them went flashing by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long stretch of country. Off across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow-covered landscape were spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad, beautiful estates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moonlight gleamed on their white</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawns, gables, and turrets, and broad ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panses of green-houses in which the rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept their famous winter gardens of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperate zone. Alternated with these</seg><seg type="columnLine">estates were the broad parks in the midst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of whose leafless trees shone the light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of suburban cottages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this sped by in an instant of time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were following one of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">monorail trunk lines.

Through the still air came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of voices and laughter, where in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">probability the socially elect of the village</seg><seg type="columnLine">were holding a New Year's Eve meeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor turned an inquiring look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Priestley.

But now the thugs had recovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their surprise and began to retort</seg><seg type="columnLine">in kind. Unfortunately, the shelter which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness afforded was in a measure</seg><seg type="columnLine">balanced by the fact that the flash of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistols could be seen, and these directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire of the foe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no sound of explosion, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, or smoke, as in an old-fashioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">firearm, but no one had yet discovered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of doing away with the flash of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shadow company at first discon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certed the foe a little by dashing into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst with drawn pistols, but as they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not fire the pistols, the assailants soon be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to feel contempt for this kind of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistance, and were too excited by the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flict to be particularly surprised at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiarly swift movements of some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">defenders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little company in the laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">had entered thoroughly into the spirit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the battle.

The professor turned on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current, and instantly there appeared on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen a long line of marching men</seg><seg type="columnLine">with torchlights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, for the island again!" he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed, rolling out a second screen be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned another lever, and in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds they were once more sweeping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pacific, to find the island again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scene that finally met their eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the little camp made their blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">run cold. Several big fires had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted. About them the outlaws were</seg><seg type="columnLine">making merry over their victory. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there were most of the men of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipwrecked party, either dead or dying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">The women and children were bound and</seg><seg type="columnLine">huddled before the largest of the fires,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they were being made the targets</seg><seg type="columnLine">for coarse jests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly a sound of martial music burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the air. At the first drum-beat the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laws started back, aghast. Then they</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped to their feet in terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One look was enough. There, march-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward them in full martial array--</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed with heavy rifles, in the ends of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were inserted torches--was a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of troops. Never was there a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">imposing sight in the bygone days of actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">war.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It mattered little to the outlaws; in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, it is doubtful that they knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">armies had for years been disbanded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This array of marching social clubs, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the historic paraphernalia they always</seg><seg type="columnLine">affected in memory of bygone war-days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the effect desired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a wild cry of terror, the savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">and half-savages made a break for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">boats, and in a few minutes were well out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, continuing the projection of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">troops past the camp for a time to prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the return of the outlaws, the professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">went about among the late captives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first, he was nonplussed by the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peals for release that went up from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women. He was unable to cut thongs with</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow-hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally he found the captain of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, who had been only slightly wounded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was recovering his senses.

He was blond</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tall, with fine, regular features, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready laugh, and the clean charm of youth</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him--also its occasional blunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing candor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I looked at him sitting there, grace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful, at ease, I wished that his mind might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have shared the litheness of his body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could have understood me so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have indeed found a place for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">collections," I observed, seating myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEHIND THE CURTAIN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">near by.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was most deferential and did all that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could to help me, but my handicaps were</seg><seg type="columnLine">many. I was not versed in their electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery. I was unaccustomed tou-their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tools, which looked for all the world as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">though they had been copied from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrosities which appear weekly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Official Gazette of the United States</seg><seg type="columnLine">Patent Office. All my conversations with</seg><seg type="columnLine">either superiors or subordinates had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be carried on in writing, in a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">language, which I had only just recently</seg><seg type="columnLine">and just barely mastered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, worst of all, most of my time had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be devoted to appearing before classes</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a horrible example of what nature can</seg><seg type="columnLine">do in an off moment, to being examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">both physically and in writing by com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittees of scientists, to entertainments</seg><seg type="columnLine">staged in my honor, and to sight-seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the city.	,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My hosts were determined to do every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in their power to make me enjoy</seg><seg type="columnLine">my visit; when if they had but known</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, my only desire was to devote myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my self-appointed task, so that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedily return to Wautoosa, which held</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that was dear to me on this planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From time to time I would inquire</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her of Doggo, and he would assure</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that she was due to stay indefinitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Wautoosa, and would certainly be there</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon my return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN SPITE of vexatious interruptions my</seg><seg type="columnLine">work gradually progressed.

The earth scientists were vindi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated!

Any change in my apparatus which</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduced my wave length also reduced my</seg><seg type="columnLine">receptivity; and any change which in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased my receptivity likewise increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wave length. So I was between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil and the deep sea. Finally I tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">condenser antennas without plates; two</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods. And then we were rewarded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech, clear, distinct and unmistakable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We ceased our work, exhausted. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">before turning in for the night, Toron</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught me how to say in Porovian language</seg><seg type="columnLine">the following sentence: "The planet Minos</seg><seg type="columnLine">sends to the placet Poros, and informs</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poros that Minos was right.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">we separated for the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning the committee were</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounded at my success. Although I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">most anxious to get back to Wautoosa at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, the committee insisted on my re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maining and demonstrating my apparatus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this took several weeks more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at. last I was permitted to return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On my arrival I was informed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl was still there, so at once I requested</seg><seg type="columnLine">an interview. At first she refused to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceive me, but Doggo, who acted as go-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">between, finally succeeded in arousing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest by hinting to her that the scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">at^Mooni had discovered that I was really</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Cupian after all. And a very handsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">one at that, now that they had succeeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in completely removing my former de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formities. So at last she reluctantly con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented. Apparently she had heard no news</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great doings at Mooni.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I planned for this meeting with even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more care and application than I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent upon my radio apparatus. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that Doggo and I were to say and</seg><seg type="columnLine">do was carefully rehearsed. My speeches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, had to be learned by rote, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had as yet no opportunity to study the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken language of Poros.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We built a head frame of heavy wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealed in my hair, and arranged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">phones so that they would lie unobserved</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the locks which covered my ears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The batteries, tube, tuning-apparatus and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one rod were on my back, carried by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt and hidden beneath my toga. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other rod and a dummy mate to it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">affixed to my forehead and camouflaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to resemble Cupian antennae. My small</seg><seg type="columnLine">microphone was located between my col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar bones, where the front edge of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">toga just concealed it. Of course, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have mounted both of my real rods on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my forehead, but that would have re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced the capacity'enough so as to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased my wave length out of the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired range. Hence the seemingly unneces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary complication of my arrangement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The need for tuning-apparatus requires</seg><seg type="columnLine">some explanation. Porovians tune for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight difference in individual wave length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by moving their antennae; but this, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, was not practicable to me, so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed for this purpose a microscopic</seg><seg type="columnLine">variable condenser on my belt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To complete my disguise we even went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the extent of fastening artificial wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my back, so that, except for the slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiarity of my hands and feet, I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sounded like a real Cupian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then we were ushered into the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lady.

But she</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly recovered her dignity and frigidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaited our advances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doggo opened the conversation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Gracious lady," said he, "Myles Cabot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I pay our most humble respects. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can see, he is now a full-fledged</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cupian, with the minor exception of fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers and toes. The object of this interview</seg><seg type="columnLine">is that he may reassure you, and apologize</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the fright which he caused you when</seg><seg type="columnLine">last you two met."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I then stepped forward. In spite of njy</seg><seg type="columnLine">transformation she cringed a bit, I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit. Evidently she still remembered my</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible beard, for she kept studying my</seg><seg type="columnLine">face inquiringly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I spoke my memorized piece, as fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows: "Gracious lady, I am your everlast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing slave, from whom you need fear no</seg><seg type="columnLine">harm."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then she spoke! The sweetest, most</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinkling, silvery voice that I have ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard. Somehow I had known that her</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice must be like that. Of course, I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet understand the spoken language</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this planet; but I stood enchanted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doggo afterward wrote out for me t£e</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance of her remarks, which were that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she ~was thrown in contact with me against</seg><seg type="columnLine">her will, but that if I comported myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumspectly she would condescend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tolerate my acquaintance, or words to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect. Never once did her cold manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">relax, and yet I fancied the merest twinkle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of interest in her heaven-blue eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We withdrew, fully satisfied that an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening had been made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doggo at once wanted to report the</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurrence to headquarters, whereas I in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted that the affair concerned no onojjut</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself.	✓</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why should headquarters care?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His reply astounded me. It took paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pencil and a great deal of explaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I finally grasped the horrible fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Cupian girl had been brought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wautoosa so that the Formians might</seg><seg type="columnLine">breed us like cattle, in an attempt to per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petuate my peculiar species.

Accordingly he" set to work in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structing me, chiefly by making me read</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud and take dictation. The language</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned out to be phonetic, after all. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, it is very like Pitman shorthand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although not quite so compact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I already knew the written language</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty thoroughly, I made rapid progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the radiated language, so that in a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">few weeks I became really proficient.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now I learned the names "Cupian" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Formian" and a great many other words</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I have used earlier in this narrative,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although only their written forms were</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to me at that time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was now able to write my name pho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">netically.

Thus my number '344-2-18'</seg><seg type="columnLine">means that I was the twentieth Formian</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatched in the second month of the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and eighty-fourth year following</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Great Peace."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Let me explain here that a year on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poros is made up of twenty months of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve days each.

It was strange that I had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked her name of either herself or Doggo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I had always called her "gracious</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady," with never a thought of any further</seg><seg type="columnLine">title.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I inquired: "If all Cupians have</seg><seg type="columnLine">names, what then is the name of the gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious lady?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this question Doggo's antennae quiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered with suppressed excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never ask that question again of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one," he adjured me. "Do not even ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lady herself. There are reasons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">state against your being told."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO RELIEVE this strained situation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I changed the subject, saying: "Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the way, it has just occurred to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask the cause of the accident to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplane on the day of my capture."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whereat Doggo, mollified, explained as</seg><seg type="columnLine">follows: "Our airplanes are stabilized en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely by gyroscopes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I interjected: "On my planet, Minos,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we .depend upon the shape and design of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wings."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be that as it may," continued Doggo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"we use gyroscopes.

For I had no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticed that they were built with long flex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible tails, so that the general appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that of a dragon fly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh," said Doggo, "the tail is the fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing element of a Porovian airship. Th^</seg><seg type="columnLine">green cows, whose milk furnishes such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">important part of the diet of us Formians,.</seg><seg type="columnLine">are preyed upon by the enormous bees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as the one who fell into the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider-web with you shortly after your</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival on this planet. These bees are</seg><seg type="columnLine">chiefly noted for their honey and for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar shrill noise which they radiate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on which account they are called 'whist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling bees.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Airplanes exist for the sole purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">of combating these predatory creatures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By one of the terms of the treaty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mooni, the Cupians are not allowed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">possess planes, and accordingly all of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">policing of the air had to be done by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Imperial Air Navy of the Formians. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, Wautoosa, where we are now stay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, is the barracks for the air navy, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">contains nothing else, which accounts for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the absence of visiting Cupians here.

I gathered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ranks of eklat and pootah correspond</seg><seg type="columnLine">respectively to commander, and lieutenant</seg><seg type="columnLine">junior grade, on earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I having done my share to relieve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tension caused by my asking of Doggo</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name of the Cupian girl, he now in turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">invited me to go on a bee hunt, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I accepted purely for politeness' sake, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RADIO MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not care to travel far from the lady.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But perhaps such a diversion would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as well, until I had made more pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gress in mastering the spoken langauge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, about a week after the conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">above related, I embarked with two young</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers for a part of the country where</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been reported that several bees were</seg><seg type="columnLine">preying upon the flocks. Doggo remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind at Wautoosa, because of certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">important military duties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The trip took almost an entire day, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we put up for the night at a small farm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing village. The farmer ants displayed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">true rustic interest in my peculiarities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the two young bar-pootahs, or en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs, took great pleasure in showing off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My fame had evidently reached this com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munity, but with it a myth to the effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my electrical antennae could discharge</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only speech, but' also death-dealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tightning at will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I treasured this piece of information--</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might come in handy some time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Early the next morning we started forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the field where the most recent bovicides</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken place, and concealed our plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some woods by the edge of the field. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not long to wait, for soon we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rewarded by a whistling sound, at which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we sailed out to meet the enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The nations' airy navies grappling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the central blue," of which Tennyson sings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't hold a candle to a battle between an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant flyer and a whistling bee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the start we circled each other, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for an opening, and each trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get on the back of the other. In this</seg><seg type="columnLine">game the airplane had a certain advantage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it was provided with grappling hooks</seg><seg type="columnLine">both above and below, and could work its</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail either up or down to strike at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">antagonist. Whereas the bee, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had legs only on the bottom side, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">could bend his sting only downward. Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if the bee should alight on the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the plane, the fight would still remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly even. But if the plane should alight</seg><seg type="columnLine">on top of the bee, it would be all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the poor bee.	^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In addition, the plane bad its fuel tank</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and its control levers located way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front, as far as possible out of reach of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sting of the bee. But the bee had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage of unified control; that is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, one of the ant ensigns flew the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine, while the other manipulated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting tail; whereas the bee controlled</seg><seg type="columnLine">both his sting and his wings with a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROUND and round we circled, first</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane on top and then the bee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two young ant-men were accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyers, so that loop-the-loop, tail-spins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct drops and other maneuvers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible, and it took all of these expedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ents to elude our antagonist. But at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bee made some slight misplay, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly we were upon his back with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grappling hooks sunk in his sides and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a moment our fighting tail was driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">home and the battle was over. The grap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pling hooks were then released, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carcass cast to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon our alighting shortly thereafter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the ant men exclaimed: "We cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly are in luck, for there is the bee's</seg><seg type="columnLine">honey pot!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And sure enough, there in front of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a silk lined opening in the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a yard in diameter. And now</seg><seg type="columnLine">I learned whence came the honey which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Formians had frequently served me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For it seems that these huge bees, as large</seg><seg type="columnLine">as horses, burrow into the ground to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depth of ten or twelve feet, line the hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">with silk of their own spinning, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">use it as a reservoir for their most excel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent honey. This, in spite of their carni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vorous proclivities, is almost identical to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the honey made by bees on earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the bar-pootahs now uncoiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long hose from the airship and stuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end into the honey reservoir, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other started up the motor; and soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were filling one of our spare tanks with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the luscious syrup, of which there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">about one hundred gallons in the hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But we had made one mistake, for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not the hole of our late victim. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">belonged instead to another bee, who sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">denly appeared angrily on the scene. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had not been warned by his whistling;</seg><seg type="columnLine">we should have been out of luck; and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was, we barely had time to scramble</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard and rise from the ground before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was upon us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then began a repetition of our former</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight, but with a difference, as we soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed, for this bee was a master of aerial</seg><seg type="columnLine">tactics. Once, when we were nearly upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back, he darted ahead, and then rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and halted, so that we nearly drove our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship onto the point of his sting. But for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunately, our pilot caught the idea of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">maneuver almost before it was executed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and quickly threw us into a left-handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiral, thus not only escaping the deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sting, but also giving the bee a bad bruise</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one of our wings as we shot by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A move like this would, of course, be</seg><seg type="columnLine">rendered entirely impossible by the steady-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing influence of the gyroscopes, were it</seg><seg type="columnLine">not for the fact that the control apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">is so arranged that the gyroscopes maintain</seg><seg type="columnLine">their position, while the whole rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine spirals around them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a while thereafter we had the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage, and finally by a clever shift de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended squarely upon the back of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bee.	But, just as our hooks were about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take hold, the bee again darted forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looped in front of us, turning over at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time, so that he was right side</seg><seg type="columnLine">up above us. Then, as we passed under</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he dropped upon the front of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine out of reach of our tail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My, but that was a well executed</seg><seg type="columnLine">move!" exclaimed one of the bar-pootahs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I never saw a whistling bee do that be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Airmen are ever appreciative of a clever</seg><seg type="columnLine">opponent, on Poros as on Earth, and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">in defeat.

The next</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroke punctured the fuel tank, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant man jumped, and the plane crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to earth, pinning me beneath it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I lay stunned for a few moments, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the angry bee bunted the wreck to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side, pulled me from beneath it, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brandished his sting above me, prepara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory to driving into my vitals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONSPIRACY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUST as the sting was about to pierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">my breast I recognized the bee.

The one who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped was lying crushed and silent near</seg><seg type="columnLine">by. 1 was alone in a small open spot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After ascertaining that the crushed ant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was beyond all help, I started off in</seg><seg type="columnLine">as nearly a straight direction as I could,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lining up first one pair of trees and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">another in order to keep from traveling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a circle. The absence of any direct sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light made orientation very difficult, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">without any shadows to judge by it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible to tell north from south or</seg><seg type="columnLine">east from west.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again, as on my second day on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, I noticed the peculiar fauna of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods, and especially the strange birds</seg><seg type="columnLine">which seemed to fly in tandem pairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally, as I passed through a small clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, a pair flew near me, and to my sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise I found that it was not a pair at all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RADIO MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but rather a single animal. In fact it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a bird at all, but rather a reptile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort, resembling a lizard with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing where each leg should be--a veritable</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying snake about three feet long.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As this peculiar winged creature flut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered near and saw me, it uttered a shrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeak and rushed at my head. The squeak</seg><seg type="columnLine">was answered in various directions, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost immediately several more flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">snakes began to converge upon me from</seg><seg type="columnLine">all sides. Luckily for me there was a stout</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick lying close at hand, and seizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">this I began to defend myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More and more of the strange aerial</seg><seg type="columnLine">snakes arrived, and soon I was surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a swarm of them, all striving to strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my head, regardless of my frantic at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempts to beat them off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was rapidly tiring from my efforts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a diversion offered, in the form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new enemy--a lavender colored hairless</seg><seg type="columnLine">catlike beast about the size of a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog--which bounded into the clearing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blood-curdling scream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Forgotten were the flying snakes, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">clambered into a tree, just barely in time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape this new onslaught. And for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten, apparently, was I by them. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">they scattered to the four winds of heaven,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving me alone with the purple beast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which paced screaming beneath my tree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt perfectly safe where I sat, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature did not appear to be a climber,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but its hideous howls were most annoying</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I noticed that the noise came entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my headset. So I switched off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current, and instantly all was silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even the silence and the compara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive safety of the tree were not particu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larly pleasant. The beast was anything but</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty, resembling a mountain lion except</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was lavender colored and hairless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with antennae and webbed feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So this was the woofus, of which I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard so much, the most dreaded carnivore</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all Poros! One of these, it was said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was easily a match for three or four ant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men; so what chance had I, perched in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my tree, if my captor chose to hang</seg><seg type="columnLine">around until hunger and thirst sHould</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">force me to descend?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this question never was answered;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, luckily for me, something else pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently attracted the attention of the woofus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it trotted off into the woods. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched on my radio and heard its</seg><seg type="columnLine">screams gradually fade away in the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When all was silent again I descended,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and picked up the line of trees which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been following when I entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing. Soon I came to another clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. There in the center lay a crippled</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplane and beside it the dead body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge ant. It was my own plane. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled in a circle, after all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In despair I sat down on the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the airship. How was I ever to get out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this wood?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then the fading daylight gave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clew. To one side the silver gray of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky was darkening, while to the other it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was assuming a pinkish hue. I could now</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell east from west, and if I hurried, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the way was not too far, I could follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">a straight line out of the wood while it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still light. So off I set, due west to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the pink of the unseen setting sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just as the pink light finally died out</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me and all became jet black on</seg><seg type="columnLine">every hand, I reached a concrete road at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last and sat down exhausted on its edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I must have slept; for the next thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I knew I was flooded by a bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, and then a kerkool stopped beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and I was hailed a cheery "Yahoo!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The driver was a lone ant-man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I struggled sleepily to my feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yahoo!"

The driver of the kerkool</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a rich farmer ant on the way to Wau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toosa on government business from one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the southern provinces. He had heard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and was very much interested in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">recent adventures; and I in turn was glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find that I could talk with him quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluently. We spent the morning chatting</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasantly as we rode along; and stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">for lunch at another tavern, where we ate</seg><seg type="columnLine">a particularly delectable mess of fried</seg><seg type="columnLine">mashed purple grasshoppers, served with</seg><seg type="columnLine">honey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the afternoon conversation lagged a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit; and finally, to kill time, my host</seg><seg type="columnLine">undertook to teach me how to drive the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kerkool. The control was not unlike that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an earth automobile, so I caught on</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily enough, and in fact drove the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine for the last hour or so, and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wautoosa, which we reached just before</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper-time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There I bade farewell to the ant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded at once to headquarters to</seg><seg type="columnLine">report the loss of the plane to the winko,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or admiral of the entire air navy. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I returned to my quarters, where I bathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and changed, and had supper with Doggo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to whom I related the sad fate of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tabby was there* and was glad to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. But I should not say "see," for these</seg><seg type="columnLine">pet buntlotes of the ants are totally blind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being guided entirely by their sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell, which is very keen. They smell with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their antennae, as well as hear, these two</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses being commingled in much the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">way as we are taught on earth to regard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two components of the Hertzian wave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">namely, electrostatic and electromagnetic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But enough of Tabby's methods of per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ception! Doggo informed me to my joy</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Cupian lady had been moved to</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters adjoining my own, and had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed herself as no longer unfriendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning I called upon her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had now made sufficient progress with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spoken language, so that we were able</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to chat quite pleasantly together. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">me tell my entire adventures since my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival on the planet, and punctuated my</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrative with many pretty "ohs" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"ahs" at the various points at which my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life was endangered and then spared. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted very good friends, it seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. At least she no longer regarded me</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a repulsive wild beast, which was some</seg><seg type="columnLine">consolation and encouragement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the succeeding days we became better</seg><seg type="columnLine">and better acquainted, she telling me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great deal about her planet, and I in turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling-.her about my life on earth. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">--warned by Doggo--never once suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she tell me who she was; and she on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her part showed no inclination to do so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doggo, at my insistence, made no re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port to headquarters that her hostility to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me had ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frequently she and I dined together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our favorite dish was a stew of alta, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mushroomlike plant which the ant men</seg><seg type="columnLine">cultivate underground on beds of chopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">tartan leaves. The secret of growing this</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant had been carefully guarded by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Formians, and has never been learned by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cupians. It tastes much like chestnuts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only not so rich, and forms the chief part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ant diet, much like rice among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japanese.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL this time I had seen nothing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my old enemy Satan; in fact, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen nothing of him since he had tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill me many months ago. I had dismissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from my mind, and so was much</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised when one day he swaggered into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my quarters in a particularly truculent</seg><seg type="columnLine">mood. Doggo was with me at the time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bristled up at the other's approach.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was plain that the two did not care</seg><seg type="columnLine">for each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How is your pet mathlab from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet Minos?" sneered Satan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, to call a person a "mathlab" is</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the worst insults that can be offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the planet Poros.

And. although the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RADIO MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">insult was directed at me, yet as it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken to my friend Doggo it was he who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been really insulted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doggo kept his temper admirably, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered the sneer with another sneer:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You forget yourself to speak so to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior officer. My only explanation is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you have been chewing some saffra</seg><seg type="columnLine">root."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The saffra is a peculiar narcotic plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is cultivated on Poros both for its</seg><seg type="columnLine">anesthetic qualities and also for use in</seg><seg type="columnLine">much the same way as alcohol is employed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth. So that Doggo had virtually ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cused Satan of being drunk, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">both a charitable way of explaining Satan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">insubordinate language and a deadly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sult in itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Satan clicked his jaws in rage, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled at Doggo the words: "I'll get your</seg><seg type="columnLine">number."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To which Doggo calmly replied: "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">get yours." •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And to my surprise, the two rushed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other and started fighting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never before having seen a duel between</seg><seg type="columnLine">two ant-men, I did not then know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">common duels are, nor that they transcend</seg><seg type="columnLine">all rank. The proper formality for chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenging to a duel is to say, as Satan had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll get your number," and the proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">formality for accepting the challenge is</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak as Doggo had spoken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The battle was a sort of combined</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrestling bout and fencing match, the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge creatures tumbling over and over</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor, each trying to get his man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dibles at the other's neck and each parry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with his own mandibles the thrusts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, to my horror, Satan slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Doggo's guard and fastened his jaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">pn Doggo's throat.

He should have severed Doggo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head while he had Jjim in his power; for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while his attention was distracted by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation with me, Doggo suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrenched loose and with a snap rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Satan's head upon the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Doggo shook himself, went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, and called for assistance; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly three ant soldiers entered, two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom removed the dead body, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third of whom brought a paint pot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush, with which he proceeded to paint</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Doggo's back, under Doggo's own num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber and the string of smaller ones, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">number which had been Satan's in life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So this was the meaning of the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers and also of the formal words</seg><seg type="columnLine">used in challenging and accepting the chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenge to a duel; Doggo had got Satan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">number in truth.

With my</seg><seg type="columnLine">false antennae and artificial wings, I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much like a Cupian as it was; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the addition of automobile goggles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the kerkool-oolo (keeper) supplied</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, I would have been willing to challenge</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one to tell me from the genuine</seg><seg type="columnLine">article.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yuri's kerkool was very similar to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant man's kerkool in which I had returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my ill-fated bee hunt, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller and provided with seats very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">like those of an earthly automobile. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a great relief, as it was very tiring to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive a kerkool standing up, as is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">habit among the an4-men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We settled outselves in the car, thanked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attendant, and soon were on the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">road headed for the Cupian boundary and</seg><seg type="columnLine">freedom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus far our plans had been carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">out like clockwork, and yet this fact made</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seem all the more likely that there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble ahead. I was filled with suspense</seg><seg type="columnLine">and excitement; and evidently my com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion was under much the same strain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for she clung to my left arm with both</seg><seg type="columnLine">her little hands. I could feel her heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating heavily and rapidly against my</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, and every now and then she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiver, although the night was warm. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed to draw her to me and comfort her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the kerkool demanded all my atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion; and besides she was a princess of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the royal house of Cupia, and I--why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was probably merely an educated animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet her intimate presence thrilled me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her confiding trust gave me courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">to face any dangers.

But evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ant man thought differently, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded to question me in detail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Whose kerkool is that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was a question which I had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected. It suddenly occurred to me that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as this was Yuri's kerkool, it might bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">some identifying royal insignia which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not noticed. And yet it would probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">be unwise to admit that it was his, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">such an admission might suggest to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligent sleuth hound such as my in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quisitor seemed to be, that my companion</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be the Princess Lilia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What seemed a happy inspiration came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my mind, and I answered: "This ker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kool belongs to Prince Toron of Cupia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now assigned to the same department in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we have been studying at Mooni."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And what department may that be?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Agriculture, of course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is that how you came to be studying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cows?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard Lilia gasp, and felt her hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">tighten convulsively on my arm.

Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">passport is invalid. It is dated three days</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago and purports to be signed by No. 340-</seg><seg type="columnLine">7-11. Yet he ceased to be a member of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Imperial Council over a sangth ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then this is not the kerkool to which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been accustomed as Prince Toron's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You see, I am recently from Mooni myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prince Toron is assigned to the electrical,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not the agricultural, department; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyhow, they don't teach about cows under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head of agriculture.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an old and stale spider's webu- Im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately a bright idea occurred to me,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and flashing on my light, I hunted for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found, the spider's cave; and into it</seg><seg type="columnLine">I led the princess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tunnel of the spider was about four</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in diameter.

At least, I could die fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And when he had killed us both, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the satisfaction of knowing that Yuri</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never learn what had become of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would always picture us together</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere, safe from his clutches. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">who knows but perhaps he would be right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if God had provided the same heaven for</seg><seg type="columnLine">both Cupians and earth folk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All these thoughts ran through my head</seg><seg type="columnLine">in much less time than it takes to set</seg><seg type="columnLine">them down here. And then I prepared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">defend myself, or rather to defend the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful creature who depended upon me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had no weapon.

The ribs and handle</seg><seg type="columnLine">are made of alloy steel of a great springi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. The covering is remarkably opaque</seg><seg type="columnLine">silk cloth. When open they are about four</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in diameter and closely resemble an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary parasol such as we have on earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But when closed they are scarcely larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a rolled-up copy of famous fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">62</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TASTIC MYSTERIES.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly, in the folded condition in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it hung at my side, it was not likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prove of much value for defensive pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poses; so I endeavored to extend it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">its full length, and had to open it first in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to do so. The opened umbrella en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely filled the tunnel, with its point to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the spider and its handle toward me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In an instant I realized that I had effec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively blocked the way against my adver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The umbrella, although not much good</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a sword, might prove quite valuable as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shield.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so it turned out. The spider hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself against it, rending the silk cover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but driving the ends of the ribs firmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the walls of the passageway. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring steel proved strong enough to with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand his onslaught, so Lilia and I with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew out of reach of his legs and waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">further developments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had not long to wait, for soon we</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the radiations of ant-men outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entrance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They must have gone in here," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, "for it is here that I saw their lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash and heard the scream."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A light appeared at the opening, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that the spider had turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and was now facing the other way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Evidently our pursuer^ could see this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, for one of them remarked, "The spider</seg><seg type="columnLine">has got them cooped in there.

Or, if they get by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider, they may hesitate to crawl through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dark tunnel.

And then the ground felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough under my knees. A twig snapped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I found that I could stand erect. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were out in the woods again! And no</seg><seg type="columnLine">Formian pursuers within sight or earshot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Close beside the exit was a thicket of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tartan bushes, that plant with the large</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart-shaped leaf so beloved of the purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasshoppers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The safest place for us," I whispered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"will be right here by the mouth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel.

But, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">their conversation died away, another</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound came to our antennae: the distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">howl of a woofus, answered from another</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter by the cry of his mate.

Somewhere under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soft padding laid on his being by gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rations of genteel civilization, stirred a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feral, blind lust to go back up there--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bite--to gouge--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurt, lad?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though Syl had been a recruit just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes, the cultured accents sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange to him. With difficulty he opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes enough to see. A man of about</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty was looking through the square open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the floor above. He was a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and rather thin. His neck was</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrawny, with a prominent Adam's apple.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graying hair fringed his bald head, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rather weak mouth was partly con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealed by a scraggly mustache, white, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stained blue with merclite, the intoxicating</seg><seg type="columnLine">chewing gum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It'll wear off," the man said, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathetic grin. "Want to come up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the galley? I'm cooky here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With assistance, Syl climbed the ladder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after passing several doors, reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the galley fifty feet above. The room was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wedge-like in shape, with one end con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming to the arc of the outside shell. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the rest of the ship that Syl had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far, it was scrupulously clean. The cook</seg><seg type="columnLine">applied hot compresses to the bruises.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Name's Splade," he volunteered. "Used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a capitalist, like you. They taxed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">down about ten years ago. You get used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it. I'm a good cook--they admit it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and treat me pretty well. Forgotten, most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them have, that I ever clipped coupons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it may be a little hard on you, lad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A small bell tinkled, and in an i«stant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Splade dived to the floor, carrying Syl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with him. Before the latter could remon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strate, the floor came up as if trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">crush him. It was as if his weight had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased many-fold. There was a dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring, which ceased almost immediately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the abnormal floor pressure gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a new experience to Syl. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled in the superbly engineered passen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger ships, whose graduated acceleration</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused hardly any discomfort, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">expensive refinement was unknown on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">freighters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Splade grinned and rose. "We're 'way</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the atmosphere, hell bent for Titan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixth satellite of Saturn. Going to stop at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mines."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SYL shivered. Before this definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">sundering of the earth ties he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">entertained, deep in his subconsciousness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some idea of desertion. Now he was irre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vocably bound to the ship for at least four</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, possibly longer, depending on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of the stop at the mines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like all space freighters, the Pleadesia</seg><seg type="columnLine">consisted of a large number of cargo com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partments, arranged compactly around a</seg><seg type="columnLine">central well which extended from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom to the top, ending in a hatchway</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the observation and navigating room</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ship's nose. Automatic mechanism,</seg><seg type="columnLine">set to the proper co-ordinates, attended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the routine, so that except for supervision</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presence of the officers was not really</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Full details of the power rooms, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were located in the thick, stubby vanes</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the electron-ejector nozzles, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown the officers by selective televisor</seg><seg type="columnLine">tabs. The navigator foci from the hooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports, and the usual amplifying auditory</seg><seg type="columnLine">systems to all parts of the ship, were pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided them also. In the top of the navi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gating room, at the very tip of the conical</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose, was the emergency outlet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Below the navigating room were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight or ten cabins used by the officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and occasional passengers. Below these</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the cargo holds, galley, hospital and</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply rooms though the Pleadesia did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">carry a doctor. At the very bottom were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laborers' quarters. The ship rotated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in flight, and by centrifugal force generated</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fictitious gravity. This enabled one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk up and down the sides of the well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignoring the ladders, when out in gravity-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Syl did not descend to the crew's</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters until he had exchanged his tat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered silks for coarse fibroids, fatigue</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes loaned him by the cook. A strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">bond had formed between them. As rep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resentatives of the small leisure class, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">belonged to the doomed. Their kind were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground between the upper and nether mill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones--the scientifically trained tech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nicists, and the laboring class.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you say you came here to get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">job, I believe you," said the older man as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syl prepared to leave, "but tell me, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't plan to be a 'mug,' do you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Syl thought of the brutalized crew and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You probably won't understand me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the new recruit, "but I want to prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">my place in the world as a man. I've done</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but useless things all my life. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the futility of it--but like a fool, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasted the time I might have been pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paring to be a technicist. I could be wear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the gold braid up above if I hadn't."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But there's the Records Office!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Syl laughed scornfully. It was well</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to everybody in twenty-second</seg><seg type="columnLine">century civilization that the government</seg><seg type="columnLine">Records Office was a sort of pensionary</seg><seg type="columnLine">where those who had been taxed dowrn</seg><seg type="columnLine">could eke out a shabby-genteel existence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had visited it once--had memories of</seg><seg type="columnLine">young-old men sticking useless pins into</seg><seg type="columnLine">futile maps. Of women, bred for genera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions to lives of gentle leisure, compiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">statistics that would remain unused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I know the Records Office. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the government's way of saying what a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeless breed we coupon-clippers are.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to prove they're wrong if I get</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed for it. I'm starting with the toughest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the worst of them. I'll study, and win</seg><seg type="columnLine">a technicist's school appointment!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes?" Splade smiled sadly. "That's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">what I thought; but I was too old, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they found out I could cook." Yet there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was;-class pride in his bearing as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched Syl walk down the well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE were about twenty labor mugs</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Pleadesia's crew. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the discipline of Mark Gunning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cargo master. This, by the way, was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a regular officer's rating, which, perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">accounted for his bullying tactics. Yet, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">his was a hard discipline, the crew was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard. The labor mugs, unskilled, usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">physically powerful, treacherous and wild,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the skimmings of half a dozen in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terplanetary ports.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was Mnig Tah, the Martian. (His</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terrestial grandparents had helped colonize</seg><seg type="columnLine">that turbulent red planet.) A short quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, with tremendous limbs, deep, hairy</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest, a habit of looking sideways at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">person addressing him. He had the typical</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarthy complexion of the human Martian.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was wanted for murder at Marsumium,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wisely refrained from signing on for</seg><seg type="columnLine">any freight trips to his native planet. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the four from the Rio Bias country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Small, lithe, with quick white smiles as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they fingered their daggers behind their</seg><seg type="columnLine">backs. Even Gunning feared them a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had made up his mind that something</seg><seg type="columnLine">would happen presently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Or Wannol, the lone representative of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus--easy going, indolent, whose tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous arms could, and did on occasion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">break a man's back. His thick skin, flabby</seg><seg type="columnLine">even to the top of his hairless head, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned a metallic bronze. Wannol believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to be handsome, and it behooved</seg><seg type="columnLine">others not to dispute with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But most of the mugs were earthmen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bred in environments of misery, suspicion</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hate, they rioted through life, brawl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Most of them were wanted for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">crime or other. But no one looked too</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely at the labor mugs. They were es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sential to this age of metal and of science,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do the hard, dirty work which could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be done more cheaply with machinery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gunning set them to work scraping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cargo holds which were to receive the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RED GERM OF COURAGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">centrate at the mines. Syl Webb was</seg><seg type="columnLine">paired off with a black named Hoyden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grinning, hulking fellow clad, by prefer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence, only in a G-string.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You not ve'y big," Hoyden said in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratiatingly when they reached the hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">assigned to them. "Take bucket, me take</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrob." With the toothed chisel he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to scrape the scale off, and as the stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosened and "fell" to the curved wall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung there by the rotation of the ship--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syl WTebb picked it up and put it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bucket. It was the first useful, manual</seg><seg type="columnLine">work he had ever done in his life. Despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">his aches, he felt almost contented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cordial relations between him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hoyden did not last very long. The big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Negro soon begged for some merclite, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Syl had none, not using the stuff. Hoy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den became very much out of humor. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">even started a backhand swing, but Syl</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped aside, and there was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eyes, suddenly gone steely-gray be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween their puffy lids, that made Hoyden</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The twenty-four hour day, based on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth time, was in force in the space lanes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the far-away whine of the annuncia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor proclaimed eighteen o'clock--six p.m.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">old style--the men were marched down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mess room where food, sent down a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube in canisters, awaited them. Begrimed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syl had begun to resemble his companions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were some malicious remarks di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rected at him, which he thought it best</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ignore, but mostly the men wolfed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">food and said little. The talk veered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a battle royal the night before with another</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew on one of the forbidden intoxicating</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas chambers that flourished under cover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Syl was forgotten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was very tired, and sought the sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cabin, with its tiers of metal bunks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were all more or less filthy, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found one near the ceiling, under an air</seg><seg type="columnLine">duct from the chemical plant. He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear the men quarreling all night over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambling game that derived from the old-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashioned "craps", nor did he notice the</seg><seg type="columnLine">odor of men's sweaty bodies long u»used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to water. He slept as he never had before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning an order came down</seg><seg type="columnLine">from above for a man to polish the metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">work in the upper well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get on up there, you, Webb!" Gunning</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered. " 'At's about all you're good for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">y' lazy swab." He leered at the savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces. "Got a loidy up there. Oh, di-mi!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gotta send up a reefined mug. Oh, yeh!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Get on up there, y'bum!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SYL WEBB found some rags and polish</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left. There was no one in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper well to direct him, so he started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">polish the nearest bright surfaces. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered neatness here, after the filth below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">soothed him, and at the same time filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with regret as he thought of the as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sured young technicists of whom he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They passed him by, one by one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprightly, secu££ in their positions, masters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this complex mechanical age, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose guilds even the few invulnerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">tax free capitalists respectfully bowed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemist, the powermen, the astronomical</seg><seg type="columnLine">mathematician passed on their way to and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their stations as the watches were</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed, and "Mug" Webb's polishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">strokes slowed as he thought of the times</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he, on some passenger flyer, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat at table as social equal of men such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as these.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following a handrail, he came to a nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row lateral passageway ending in an ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servation bay, the only one in the Plea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">desia. He caught his breath at the beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the scene. They were passing Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its sunward side. It filled a quarter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unfathomable black space-vista. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrast the reflected sunlight was dazzling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For once the incessant red dust storms</seg><seg type="columnLine">were absent, and the canals, like delicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacework, could be seen unobstructed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beautiful!" he exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I love it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beside him, rapt eyes on the spectacle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood a girl who put the beauties of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">celestial voids to shame. She was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty, possibly a little less. Her slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">young body was wrapped in the gossamer</seg><seg type="columnLine">long robe of the era, that concealed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">yet maddeningly accentuated the delicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">feminine curves of her figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her uncovered head in its amber nimbus</seg><seg type="columnLine">of silky hair was thrown back. She gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the spectacle under long lashes that left</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes, dark blue, deep in shadows. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep aesthetic emotion had brought bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">spots of color to her cheeks that, in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfection, defied the glaring light stream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beautiful!" she breathed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very beautiful!" Syl said devoutly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It always affects me the same way,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said. "There's no more lovely sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the solar system."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nor in heaven!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned, smiling, for she was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">unused to gallantry; but when she saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him her expression changed to horror. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">white hand flew to her throat and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood as if paralyzed for a moment. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Syl was puzzled. Then the realization of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his position came to him. For a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had forgotten that he was no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">an aristocrat, but a mug. How his bruised,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unkempt appearance must have shocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">her!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a bitterly unhappy mood he finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">his task, then sought out Splade in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">galley to tell him what had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little cook surveyed him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror, a trickle of blue-tinted merclite</seg><seg type="columnLine">saliva running unheeded out of the corners</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You fool!" he blurted. "That's Maida</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stanley, daughter of the chief technicist</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Titan! Of all the fool things you could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done, why did you have to speak to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her? Man, don't you realize you're a mug</seg><seg type="columnLine">now? If she reports you, you'll spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of your life in the ore docks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Syl did not think of what would happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">if she reported him. He thought of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentle line of her white throat in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">garish light of Mars, of the thrilled, im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsive words she had spoken to him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought long of her that night, lying on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his metal shelf, one arm over his stubbly</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next three weeks were the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">miserable and the most satisfying in</seg><seg type="columnLine">SylT hitherto protected life. He resolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">banished thought of the girl to the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his mind, where her memory tormented</seg><seg type="columnLine">him only occasionally. With conscious pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose he identified himself with the mugs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">became one of them in their rough ways--</seg><seg type="columnLine">even learned to think like them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the back-breaking hours of labor he</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked to think of his fight with Naylor Bey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant Mazurian, that first week. Nay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lor Bey had his own style of fighting. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to shove his wirelike whiskers into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syl's throat as he held him in a bear's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hug. But Syl evaded him time and again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut him to pieces with scientifically spaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">punches, knocked him, bleeding, into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner. Bey regarded him after that with</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled wonder, and showed no resent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Splade, who had received the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails of that fight from one of the mugs</seg><seg type="columnLine">on an unauthorized visit to the galley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed enthusiastically as he taped up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cracked rib:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're showing 'em, boy! You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing 'em! The mugs are more'n half</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you. Oh, if I was only your age!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Syl Webb smiled, but said nothing. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">little later, swaggering down the well, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">met Mark Gunning, who accorded him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grudging, half friendly nod. Syl did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">go looking for trouble. With all his flower-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing self-confidence he had also acquired an</seg><seg type="columnLine">atavistic cunning. To live long one must</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be too pugnacious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He learned to play the mugs' games,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to chew merclite in moderation. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">goodly supply of this dangerous solace had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been smuggled aboard by a member of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crew, and was for sale. He acquired</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a slight liking for the acrid, heady</seg><seg type="columnLine">gum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the time being, of necessity he put</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside thoughts of becoming a technicist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had no books, could not get any nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">did he know where to begin. Time enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that when he would be discharged at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the home port, with a half year's wages</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his pouch. It was more entertaining,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway, to loll on his bunk and listen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RED GERM OF COURAGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the wild tales of adventure, of unrecorded</seg><seg type="columnLine">battles, of shady deeds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He began to feel a real fellow-feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the mugs. He well knew now how hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be to rise from the stratum into</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they had been born and he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced by circumstances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He began to feel a vague resentment</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the ranks of the capitalists which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had so recently quitted. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural to hate them, and also, in a differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent way, the technicists, whose supercilious</seg><seg type="columnLine">superiority rankled in his heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were no better than he! Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">luckier. Up there they posed around in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their brass and broadcloth, while here be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low were men, just as good as they, sweat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in this filthy hole!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This resentment was a stage he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">outgrow, for he knew at heart that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">technicists had studied and worked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their rank. But now he was not backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sharing his thoughts with the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">mugs, and they replied in kind. So it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Salvader, one of the Rio Bias men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose from a whispered conference back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a bulkhead and approached him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We thought we have to keel you, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">now maybe we no need," he remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Syl Webb felt a queer little thrill of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear. All eyes were on him--not unfriendly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not friendly either. Merely speculative.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were weighing in their minds whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not it would be advisable to kill him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighing the question impersonally, calmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispassionate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, y' can't get out the door," Mark</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunning remarked evenly, interpreting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syl's quick glance. "I got a squizzle." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">held up a small ionic projector, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">sizzling beam carried death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what is the proposition?" Syl</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked calmly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," Salvader explained frankly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"in ordinar' case, we keel you anyway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but for thees, we need you.

Such things still happened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syl found himself accepting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought equably, but deep within him pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">test stirred. The fate of the officers was</seg><seg type="columnLine">foregone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Going to kill the technies?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure!" Gunning grinned. "We can run</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship. Some of the mugs have picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit, here'n' there.

Mutiny, murder and piracy. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become calloused enough to view</seg><seg type="columnLine">brutality with a certain equanimity. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vision of the girl in the Mars-light by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the port came back with a rush, swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">away the savage, resentful mists of class</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatred with which he had deliberately be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fogged his mind. Through a red blur he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the cynical, leering face of Mark</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunning, the circle of predatory faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their calculating eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As from a distance he heard his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, casual, cool: "Uh-huh. And the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">up above?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a roar of laughter, approv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, understanding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got your eyes on her already, hey?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The gyp's a snaky bargainer, hey?" Gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning grinned, looking back over his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der.

Kill or be killed, eat or be eaten--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was the rule.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had been spared for the sole reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he might be useful. That he should</seg><seg type="columnLine">purchase his life at the price of a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">others was normal. The only sane thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do, in mug philosophy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the very first flash of understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his human decency had overcome his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathy for the mugs. His course seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">absurdly simply: merely to report to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain. Warned, the crew of eight tech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nicists and the two officers' stewards, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the highpowered projectors stored above,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could easily overpower the mutineers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand them, over to the Interplanetary Fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Police when hailed by them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Gunning was of the stuff of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaders are made. On Syl's first attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to edge casually toward the technicists'</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters, Webb was suddenly pricked by</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen knife points in four separate places</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his back. The Rio Bias men let him</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel the keenness of their weapons, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">ironically stood aside to let him go back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To keel you, mister sir," Salvader</seg><seg type="columnLine">purred, "we would regret veree much!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Veree much we would regret him!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunning came out of a hold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No use yer tryin' to squeal. Or maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">y' wasn't?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course not! I was just looking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah?" Gunning's beady eyes bored</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his own. "Well, y' can find out more</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cabin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Closely guarded, Syl was returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crew's quarters. Strong, thin arm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg irons were clamped on him, attached</seg><seg type="columnLine">to such short chains that he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie down in the corner to which they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened. On space ships no waste space</seg><seg type="columnLine">is available for use as a brig--hence the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping quarters are used, and they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cramped and uncomfortable as he was,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Syl's misery was enhanced by the plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning of the mutiny. He could, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat, every word, and the lecherous refer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ences to the lone woman passenger roused</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to rage. Yet he maintained his cynical,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mocking attitude, hoping they would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lease him while there was still time. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if he could attract Splade's at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention. Splade did not mingle much with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mugs. He would therefore be loyal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In fact, he soon knew Splade was loyal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the little Eurasian, Tiang, was dele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gated to kill him as the signal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plan of the mutineers was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pact and direct. Bell 23, about fourteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours hence, was the time. That would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be an hour before the changes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch. All on the ship would be sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">except the officers on duty. Tiang, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed Splade, was to wait in the galley to</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer, after a fashion, any chance call</seg><seg type="columnLine">from above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gunning, Hoyden and the Martian Tah.</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to creep up to the navigating room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only one officer would be there--Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kellerman himself. Epstan, the mathema-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tician, and cocky young Arberson, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemist, would be sleeping. And four of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the powermen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That would leave two powermen on</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty, one on each side of the ship, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooded cubicle from which he controlled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the propulsion jets on'that side. The power</seg><seg type="columnLine">cubicles presented a real difficulty. Ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cording to the Spatial Acts they must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked on the inside. Only the captain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the powermen on duty had keys, and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain's key would not open the doors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the powermen set the emergency bars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The powermen, once apprised of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was happening through their televisor tabs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could cripple the ship and deliver it even-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tually into the hands of the Interplanetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flying Police. But because the powermen</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be depended on to be brave men, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mug strategists planned to use that brav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Captain Kellerman were murdered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tortured perhaps, wouldn't these brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">young men dash out to assist him?

This was a desper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate game they were playing. About that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had no illusions. Failure, or discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the I. F. P. before they could set up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy projectors included in the cargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be used for the defense of the mines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant only one thing--and it was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant to contemplate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A summary court-martial. Then a knot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of struggling men, half insane with fear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced into the airlock. A few seconds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence after the thud of the inner lock--</seg><seg type="columnLine">then to be spewed, instantaneously bloated</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpses, tumbling, falling free, oozing blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">frozen on their skins--to swing for eternity</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their lonely orbit or to plunge into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such was the fate of pirates caught in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the space lanes, and the mugs, knowing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached their battle for a well-armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship and the prospect of possible years of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space marauding, with a certain cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferocity. Syl was never left alone for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second. All of his simulated hope for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">success of the mutiny failed to win for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a moment's freedom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Y' get yer chance when y' speak the</seg><seg type="columnLine">I.

The door slammed. He tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">violently, as he had before surreptitiously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to release himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mugs were armed with knives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clubs, cargo hooks. Gunning alone had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern weapon. Treading softly, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">started up the well, walking on the sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">like flies, for there was no gravity--only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightly centrifugal force of the ship's</seg><seg type="columnLine">axial rotation. Tiang darted out &lt;5F the</seg><seg type="columnLine">galley, where he had crept shortly before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He whispered excitedly.

Furtive figures crept in. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">little farther up was Epstan. His door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened, too, letting in the gray light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The massacre was over in a few seconds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Acting with rehearsed precision, the mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derers snapped on the light switches, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patched their victims while they were still</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazzled by the glare. The lights were</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkened again, and slinking figures with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripping knives joined their fellows. Arber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son happened to be in the chemical room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursing the leaks. He gave them a game</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight, but he was soon overwhelmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gunning listened at the door of Maida</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stanley's cabin. She was sleeping, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would keep till later. One cabin door was</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked. This undoubtedly held the all-</seg><seg type="columnLine">important controls of the heavy projectors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It also could wait.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Overhead was the glassed grating of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">navigating room. The old man was operat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the automatic bearing connotator.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunning crept up the short ladder. Gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pushed the grating, swinging it on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">pivots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had it half open when it creaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly. Captain Kellerman jumped up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">overturning his chair. He took in the situ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation instantly, and leaped to the wall for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the projector hanging there. But before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could turn, Gunning's beam fell on him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The black hole through his body smoldered</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he sprawled on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gunning leaped off the ladder to sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion himself at the well-head, weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready. Channing, starboard powerman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped out of his cubicle, roaring his rage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was weaponless, and Gunning cut him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down without mercy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up above was a slight commotion. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers' stewards had been found hiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a chest, and several of the mugs, amid</seg><seg type="columnLine">much laughter, were dragging them to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">airlocks, along with the bodies of the mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered technicists. Fearing Gunning, no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had touched the girl. Her white, fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened face had appeared at her cabin door</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an instant. Then she had locked her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Helgrim, the port powerman, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">net only brave--he was prudent. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the murder of Captain Kellerman on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">televisor tab, and like Channing, felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulse to dash out of his locked cubicle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But unlike Channing, he had been a mug</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself before his long, arduous climb to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his present position. Many mugs could</seg><seg type="columnLine">operate the power generator, but few had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helgrim's shrewdness that enabled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to break into the close corporation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">technicist guild.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of following his impulse to dash</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the rescue, he paused with his hand on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lock and listened. A few moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, faintly hearing the noise of the tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umphant mugs, he took a long chance. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw the port jets into full reverse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a foolhardy thing to do, oi ly</seg><seg type="columnLine">justifiable in this extreme emergency, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tremendous strain might easily have</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried away the port vanes, and the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">cubicle, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under the terrific reaction of the elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronic blast, in which millions of horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">power was expended in a few seconds, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge ship flipped over and over. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could remove his hand from the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol, Helgrim was thrown against the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his cubicle. His desperate grip was torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose, but just before he lost consciousness</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw a blinding flash. The activator</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuse had blown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately the ship's automatic course</seg><seg type="columnLine">director took charge again, the auxiliary</seg><seg type="columnLine">circuit taking up the load, and brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pleadesia back on an even keel. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helgrim's desperate expedient, as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped, seriously disorganized the pirates.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As they had all been in the forward part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the well, with nothing at hand to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to, they had been flipped about sixty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, to land in a heap against the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">grating. Salvader's skull was crushed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the others were badly injured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cursing, and reckless in their rage, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to assemble one of the heavy pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jectors to burn down the port power door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">battering down the cabin doors in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">search for the parts.

Splade had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave of his work before the regular time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had been wafting gently among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">airy fantasies of a merclite dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Weaving on unsteady legs, he started</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the well toward the lighted grating</seg><seg type="columnLine">some three hundred feet away.

Fists raised in</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he believed to be a pugilistic atti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude, Splade kicked open the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaning against the wall to which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been chained, Syl looked as if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RED GERM OF COURAGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been horsed very much indeed. There had</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, been no opportunity for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be thrown as the mutineers had been,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he had been viciously shaken, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue light disclosed the ghastly pallor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face. At Splade's appearance, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flush of joy overspread his features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Splade!

Although the metal was light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly more than wire, it was very tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">and time seemed endless before Syl's arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">was free save for the light metal cuff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was the ever present danger that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the mutineers might come back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Syl wielded the maul after that, Splade</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding the chisel, and under the former's</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposeful blows the three remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">chains soon lay on the floor. A mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment later, through the half-open door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they heard footsteps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UICK!" Shoving the shaking Splade</seg><seg type="columnLine">into one of the higher bunks, Syl</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped up to the next one. Here they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple of feet over the heads of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing in the room. They were barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time, for four of the mugs crowded in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Foremost was Wannol, his wtinkled</seg><seg type="columnLine">bronze head flecked with tiny specks of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">blood. Behind him were Tweedy, a rat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced little renegade from the Clyde, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">two coppery, coarse-haired Indians who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were naked save for torn strips of gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">braid ripped from the murdered techni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cists' uniforms. Blood-lust glistened in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Says it's under the bottom bunks,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wannol rumbled. "Get under there, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">swabs! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The others started to haul out a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">coil of insulated cable. But in a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tweedy snapped defiantly upright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An' who are yew to order us 'round?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wannol advanced ominously, his enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous shoulders hunched. Tweedy, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen that look before, blanched. His hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped furtively to his belt, to the hilt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his curved thin-bladed knife. But Wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nol, like a human avalanche, enveloped</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. There was a dull crackle, a relaxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">sigh, and the limp body of Tweedy sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor. Wannol contemptuously</seg><seg type="columnLine">plucked the knife out of his fat shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and threw it rattling on the floor plates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now!" he growled looking at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With little trace of their traditional</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolidity they bent their backs to the load</seg><seg type="columnLine">and staggered out of the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wannol started to follow them, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">his glance suddenly rested on the severed</seg><seg type="columnLine">chain ends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was some seconds before his slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain functioned. He glared around and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then his red-rimmed opaque brown eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell on the crouching form of the missing</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner. With a bellow he charged, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible arms upraised, his inhumanly</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful hands clutching, talonlike, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But they never closed on their victim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syl balanced himself on the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunk, drew up his powerfully muscled</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs, and at precisely the right moment let</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive with all his strength. His heavy-soled</seg><seg type="columnLine">work shoes struck squarely in the bronze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mottled face of the man of Venus, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the power of his clean young body now</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempered and hardened by labor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blow did not kill Wannol, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was extraordinarily tough, but it stunned</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Syl tied him with a short length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cable that the Indians had overlooked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he looked out into the well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At its forward or upper end he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">knotted around a squat contrivance</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted on skids, with a large tube, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">counterpart of the small hand projectors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Syl guessed correctly at the reason for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his recent shaking up. The brave power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was shortly to be burned into eternity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment of realization a plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang full-grown in Syl Webb's brain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A plan so utterly hazardous and foolhardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the best he could hope for if he suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded was death--a swift and merciful</seg><seg type="columnLine">death for himself and the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SWIFTLY and efficiently he stripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tweedy's body of his gaudy orange</seg><seg type="columnLine">fibroids. Picking up Tweedy's knife, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged into the well, ran swiftly toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lighted part where the big projector</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ready to start. Those who glanced at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him thought he was Tweedy, for the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">was poor and their minds were on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">projector.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gunning sighted, set the intensity con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol at low. Rack came the lever. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a roar like a giant blow-torch the projector</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw its powerful beam against the metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of the power cubicle. In a few sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onds though it was heavily armored, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">door would crumble like a rag. The muti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neers involuntarily retreated a few paces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they did so a figure separated itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them--a figure in gaudy orange</seg><seg type="columnLine">fibroids. Swift as light the narrow blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped in, straight to the lever slot in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">control box, slashed into the delicate maze</seg><seg type="columnLine">of platinum wires. There was an instan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneous flash, and a ball of fire leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. The tube glowed white, collapsed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gunning and Syl had both leaped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've killed us all!" Gunning roared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatching out his hand weapon. He pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it at the supposed Tweedy, but sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement halted his finger on the but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So! You!" His weapon flashed--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">puny beam compared to the heat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-destroying great projector. The heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">was intense in the confined space. Syl</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not been hit. His jump had carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to the forward side of the scintillating</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass, and the mutineers could not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">see him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back of him a door opened. The heat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrating the walls, had driven the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. There was a slight bruise on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple. Her face was pale, but she faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">death with the courage of the finely bred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Syl threw off his cap, and wiped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">grime-and-sweat-streaked face with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeve. She recognized him, gave him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brave smile. With true instinct she guessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the facts of the present situation. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered no resistance as he led her up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grating into the deserted navigation</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That inescapable inferno would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop until the proton container was empty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long before then the ship would be but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe of molten metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The controls are shorted," Syl said</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravely to the girl. "No human being can</seg><seg type="columnLine">get close enough to throw the switch. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what that means."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes." There was the barest possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremble in her voice as she looked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">full in the face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unpremeditatedly, reverently, his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">went around her lissome waist, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">kissed her once on the upturned mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he would have released her, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">clung to him, pressed her body against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his, so that the delicate fabric of her robe</seg><seg type="columnLine">was soiled by the grime of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have only a few minutes to live,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she whispered. "I have thought of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">often since the day you spoke to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though you frightened me. Hold me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They moved over to the wall, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrible cold of space relieved the acrid</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat pouring in through the grating. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">howl of the mutineers came to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Animals!" exclaimed Syl Webb. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear death. They cannot die bravely."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who says 'brave'?" The face of Mark</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunning appeared over the floor edge. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RED GERM OF COURAGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was a horrible sight. Nearly all the cloth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was burned off his body, the hair was</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorched from his head. He was a living</seg><seg type="columnLine">cinder. His cracked, baked skin smoldered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave off a sickening odor. His sneer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing face, shockingly seared beyond human</seg><seg type="columnLine">semblance, was the face of a damned soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising out of hell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who says 'brave'?" shouted Mark Gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning. He held up his right arm, charred</seg><seg type="columnLine">off at the wrist. "See that? Me, Mark</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunning--reached in there and turned it</seg><seg type="columnLine">off! Stuck my bare arm into the melted</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal 'n' turned th' bar. Who says</seg><seg type="columnLine">'brave'? The woman's mine!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's dying," Syl murmured aside. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't last. He'll drop dead in a minute."</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the mug leader's immense vitality</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not let him die. Eyes glazed, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled about the r.oom, vainly looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the girl. The other mugs, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved from death by Gunning's super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">human bravado swarmed up the ladder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SYL, quick to avert the new danger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized the girl and drew her up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal rungs to the peak of the chamber,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the emergency exit cap. His hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped the lever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fire, or come one step closer, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down comes this lever. Know what that</seg><seg type="columnLine">means? We'll all pop out of here like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cork out of a bottle. Understand? One</seg><seg type="columnLine">step closer and we're all dead men!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mutineers understood. They cursed, •</seg><seg type="columnLine">they blasphemed, but they dropped their</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons. Their slow retreat became a</seg><seg type="columnLine">panicky scramble as Syl, shifting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight, rested his hand too heavily on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lever for a moment, accompanied by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hiss of escaping air. It mattered not</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the same fate probably awaited them</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as the I. F.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">filming eyes cleared, and he saw Syl Webb</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the girl. With agony in every move-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, he stooped to pick up with his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maining hand one of the projectors</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped by the mugs. Slowly, with in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finite effort, he raised it until it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed straight at Syl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At that moment a knife flashed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air from the group of frightened mugs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and buried itself deep in Mark Gunning's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. As he slipped slowly to the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark red blood started dripping off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knife handle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The abject mutineers rushed forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw themselves on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We surrender!" they chorused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Syl's voice was edged with disgust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Put the weapons back in the rack, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">see they're all there.

But I could not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon what system their time recording</seg><seg type="columnLine">was based.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later I was to find that reckoning</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested upon the extraordinary increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminosity of the cliffs at the time of full</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon on earth. This action, to my mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being linked either with the effect of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-streaming globes upon the Moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pool, whose source was in the shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs, or else upon some mysterious af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finity of their radiant element with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hood of moonlight on earth. The latter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">most probably, because even when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon must have been clouded above, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no difference in the phenomenon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thirteen of these shining forth con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stituted a laya, one of them a lat.

A sais of laya was then literally ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand years. What we would call an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour was by them called a va. The whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">time system was, of course, a mingling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time as it had been known to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">remote, surface-dwelling ancestors, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peculiar determining factors in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast * cavern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour of our time is the equivalent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an hour and five-eights in Muria.

While the Afyo Maie sits</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that of yours which certainly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terests her," he said, maliciously.

I paused before</seg><seg type="columnLine">entering it to examine the polished surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of runways and great road. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">obsidian--volcanic glass of pale emerald,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unflawed, translucent, with no sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">block or juncture. It was, indeed, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it had been poured molten, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then gone over as carefully as a jeweler</seg><seg type="columnLine">would a gem. I examined the shell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What makes it go?" I asked Rador.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At a word from him the driver touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">a concealed spring and an aperture ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared beneath the control-lever. Within</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a small cube of black crystal, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose sides I saw, dimly, a rapidly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volving, glowing ball, not more than two</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches in diameter. Beneath the cube was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curiously shaped, slender cylinder wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down into the lower body of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nautilus whorl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch!" said Rador. He motioned me</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the vehicle and took a place beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. The driver touched the lever; a stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of coruscations flew from the ball into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinder. The shell started smoothly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as the tiny torrent of shining particles</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased it gathered speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The corial does not touch the road,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained Rador. "It is lifted so far"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">---he held his forefinger and thumb less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a sixteenth of an inch apart--"above</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And perhaps here is the best place to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain the activation of the shells or</seg><seg type="columnLine">coria. The force utilized was atomic energy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Passing from the whirling ball the ions</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted through the cylinder to two bands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a peculiar metal affixed to the base</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the vehicles somewhat like skids of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sled. Impinging upon these they pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced a partial negation of gravity, lift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the shell slightly, and at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time creating a powerful repulsive force</seg><seg type="columnLine">or thrust that could be directed backward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, or sidewise at the will of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver. Something of the same kind of force</seg><seg type="columnLine">accounted for the "hearing-talking" globes</seg><seg type="columnLine">they used to communicate with each other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">96</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE wide, glistening road was gay</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the coria. They darted in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the gardens; within them the fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired, extraordinarily beautiful women</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their cushions were like princesses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elfland, caught in gorgeous fairy webs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting within the hearts of flowers. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">some shells were flaxen-haired, dwarfish</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of Lugur's type. Sometimes black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">polled brother officers of Rador. Often</seg><seg type="columnLine">raven-tressed girls, plainly handmaidens</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the women. And now and then beauties</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lower folk went by with one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blond dwarfs--and then it was plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed what their relations were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among those who walked along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralleling promenade were none of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair-haired. And the haunting wistfulness</seg><seg type="columnLine">that underlay the thin film of gaiety on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faces and in the eyes of the black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired folk, and its contrast with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinisterly sweet malice, the sheer, unhuman</seg><seg type="columnLine">exuberance of life written upon the fair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired, made something deep, deep, within</seg><seg type="columnLine">me tremble with indefinite repulsion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We swept around the turn that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the jewel-like roadway an enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">horseshoe and, speedily, upon our right</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliffs through which we had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our journey from the Moon Pool began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to march forward beneath their mantels</seg><seg type="columnLine">of moss. They formed a gigantic abut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, a titanic salient. It had been from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very front of this salient's invading</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle that we had emerged. On each</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of it the precipices, faintly glowing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew back and vanished into distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the bridge-span we had first crossed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rador stopped the corial, beckoning me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accompany him. We climbed the arch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stood once more upon the mossy</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge. Half a score of the dwarfs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting into the cliff face, using tools</seg><seg type="columnLine">much resembling our own pneumatic drills,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except that they had no connection with</seg><seg type="columnLine">any energizing machinery. The drills bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">in smoothly but slowly. I imagined that</seg><seg type="columnLine">their power was supplied by the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">force that ran the coria, and asked Rador.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They search for your disappearing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">portal," he grinned, mischievously. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of the depth of that monstrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">slice of solid stone that had dropped be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore us and over whose top we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed through the hundred-foot tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I felt fairly certain that they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not soon penetrate to the well of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairway that it concealed and to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Golden Girl had led us. And I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally sure the art that had covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">this entrance so amazingly had provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same time a screen for the oval,</seg><seg type="columnLine">high above, through which our eyes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">first beheld the city of the Shining One.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somewhat grimly I asked Rador why</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did not use the green ray to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">integrate the rock, as it had the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Songar. He answered that they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">use it, but sparingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were two reasons for this, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on to explain; first, that, in varying</seg><seg type="columnLine">degrees, all the rock walls resisted it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shining cliffs on the opposite side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the White Waters completely. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">second, that when it was used it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the risk of very dangerous rock falls</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were, it appeared, lines of non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistance in the cliffs--faults, I suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">--which, under the Keth, disintegrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantaneously. These lines of non-resist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance could not be mapped out beforehand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were likely to bring enormous masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the resistant portion tumbling down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly, I gathered, as a structure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cemented stone would tumble if the cement</seg><seg type="columnLine">should abruptly crumble into dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They seldom used the ray, therefore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for tunneling or blasting rock in situ.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The resistant qualities of the barriers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were probably due to the presence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">radioactive elements that neutralized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibratory ray whose essence was, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself radioactive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The slender, graceful bridges under</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we skimmed ended at openings in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upflung, far walls of verdure. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">had its little garrison of soldiers. Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the openings a rivulet of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green obsidian river passed. These were</seg><seg type="columnLine">roadways to the farther country, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land of the ladala, Rador told me; adding</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONQUEST OF THE MOON POOL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">97</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that none of the lesser folk could cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the pavilioned city unless summoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">or without pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We turned the bend of the road and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew down that further emerald ribbon</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had seen from the great oval. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore us rose the shining cliffs and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake. A half-mile, perhaps, from these</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last of the bridges flung itself. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more massive and about it hovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spirit of ancientness lacking in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other spans; also its garrison was larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at its base the tangent way was</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded by two massive structures, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what like block-houses, between which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran. Something about it aroused in me</seg><seg type="columnLine">an intense curiosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where does that road lead, Rador?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the one place above all of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I may not tell you, Goodwin," he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered. And again I wondered, and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wonder burst a thought. Did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road lead to Throckmartin and those</seg><seg type="columnLine">others the Dweller had made its prey?</seg><seg type="columnLine">How could T find out?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We skimmed slowly out upon the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">pier. Far to the left was the prismatic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rainbow curtain between the Cyclopean</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillars. On the white waters swam grace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful shells, luculent replicas of the elf</seg><seg type="columnLine">chariots, but none was near that distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">web of wonder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rador, what is that?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is the veil of the Shining One!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he answered slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was the Shining One that which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">named the Dweller?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is the Shining One?" I cried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly. Again he was silent. Nor did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak until we had turned on our home-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And lively as was my interest, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific curiosity, I was conscious sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly of acute depression. Beautiful, won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drously beautiful, this place was, and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its wonder dwelt a keen edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">menace, of unease, of inexplicable, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">human woe.

I wondered why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as I wondered he entered. He sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a cheerful grin, and Yolara darted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance at him that was revealing. Lugur</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw it, too, and read it aright, for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face darkened. Began then our examina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, for such it was. And as it progressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was more and more struck by the change</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the O'Keefe. All flippancy was gone;</seg><seg type="columnLine">rarely did his sense of humor reveal it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in any of his answers. He was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cautious swordsman, fencing, guarding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">studying his opponent. Or rather, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chess-player who keeps sensing some far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching purpose in the game; alert, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained, watchful. Always he stressed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power qf our surface races, their multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tudes, their solidarity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their questions were myriad. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">were our occupations? Our system of</seg><seg type="columnLine">government? How great were the waters?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The land? Intensely interested were they</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our wars, querying minutely into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">98</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">causes; their results. Lugur was curiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent, but at some of our answers I</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught his sneer and saw behind it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Von Hetzdrop! In our weapons their</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest was avid. And they were exceed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly minute in their examination of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us as to the ruins which had excited our</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity; their position and surroundings</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and if others than ourselves might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected to find and pass through their</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this I shot a glance at Lugur. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not seem unduly interested. I won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered if the German had told him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet of the girl of the rosy wall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moon Pool Chamber and the real reasons</seg><seg type="columnLine">for our search. Then I answered as briefly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as possible, omitting all reference to these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. The red dwarf watched me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmistakable amusement, and I knew Von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hetzdorp had told him. But clearly Lugur</seg><seg type="columnLine">had kept his information even from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yolara; and as clearly she had spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">to none of that episode when O'Keefe's</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic had shattered the Keth-smitten</seg><seg type="columnLine">vase.

Larry came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me just after our fourth sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on to a concert," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We skimmed off to one of the bridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">garrisons. Rador called the twoscore guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">to attention. And then, to my utter stupe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faction, the whole company, O'Keefe lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them, roared out the "Marseillaise</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Allons, enfants de la patrie!" they sang</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a closer approach to the French than</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been expected ten or fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles below France's level. "Marchons!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mar chons!" they bellowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was irresistibly funny; and in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter I forgot for the moment my</seg><seg type="columnLine">forebodings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just wait until you hear Yolara lisp</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pretty little thing I taught her," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larry as we set back for what we now</seg><seg type="columnLine">called home. There was an impish twinkle</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I did hear. For it was not many</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes after that the priestess condes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cended to command me to come to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">with O'Keefe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Show Goodwin how much you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned of our speech, O lady of the lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">of honeyed flame!" murmured Larry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She hesitated; smiled at him, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that perfect mouth, out of the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quisite throat, in the voice that was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chiming of little silver bells, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">trilled a melody familiar to me indeed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    "She's only a bird in a gilded cage,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    A bee-yu-tiful sight to see--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so on to the bitter end. I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare to look at O'Keefe.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">sullenness that held acid bitterness even</seg><seg type="columnLine">as '"Iheir subtle, half-sinister, half-gay</seg><seg type="columnLine">malice seemed tempered into little keen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edged flames, oddly, menacingly defiant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were many of the green-clad</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers along the way, and the garrison</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the only bridge span I could see had</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly been doubled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wondering still, I turned from my point</seg><seg type="columnLine">of observation and made my way back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our pavilion, hoping that Larry, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been with Yolara for the past two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours, had returned. Hardly had I reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">it before Rador came hurrying up, in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner a curious exultance, mingled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">what in any one else I would have called</seg><seg type="columnLine">a decided nervousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come!" he commanded before I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak.

"There is much</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be done, and the time grows short!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He led us to a tiny fountain room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in whose miniature pool the white waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">were concentrated, pearl-like and opales-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent in their circling rim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bathe!" he commanded; and set the</seg><seg type="columnLine">example by stripping himself and plung-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing within. We followed. I experienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peculiar stimulation that these waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">always gave. They seemed to sparkle</seg><seg type="columnLine">through every nerve and muscle. Only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute or two did the green dwarf allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, and he checked us as we were about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to don our clothing. And let me note</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we had long been provided with</seg><seg type="columnLine">al! necessary garments to replace our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I would, indeed, gladly have donned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outer costume of the place, save that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larry had clung to his uniform; and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I kept also to my knickerbockers, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">stockings, and my canvas shoes, compro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mising, however, with a Murian tunic</seg><seg type="columnLine">above them in the place of my American</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, to my intense embarrassment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without warning, two of the black-haired</seg><seg type="columnLine">;?irls entered, bearing robes of a peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull-blue hue. At our manifest discomfort</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Rador's bellow of laughter roared out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took the garments from the pair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">motioned them to leave us, and, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing, threw one around me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Its texture was soft, but decidedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic, like some blue metal spun to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fineness of a spider's thread. The gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment buckled tightly at the throat, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">girdled at the waist, and, below this</seg><seg type="columnLine">cincture, fell to the floor, its folds being</seg><seg type="columnLine">held together by a half-dozen looped</seg><seg type="columnLine">cords; from the shoulders a hood re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembling a monk's cowl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rador cast this over my head; it com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely covered my face, but was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">so transparent a texture that I could see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though somewhat mistily, through it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally he handed us both a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">long gloves of the same material and</seg><seg type="columnLine">high stockings, the feet of which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloved--five-toed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And again his laughter rang out at our</seg><seg type="columnLine">manifest surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The priestess of the Shining One does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not altogether trust the Shining One's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Voice," he said at last. "And these are</seg><seg type="columnLine">to guard against any sudden--errors. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear not, Goodwin," he went on kindly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not for the Shining One itself would</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yolara see harm come to Larree here</seg><seg type="columnLine">--nor, because of him, to you. But I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not stake much on her heart toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Double Tongue whom Lugur has claimed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor to the great white one. And for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last I am sorry, for him I do like well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are they to be with us?" asked Larry</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are to be where we go," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dwarf soberly. "For Double Tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is no more peril than for you. Lugur</seg><seg type="columnLine">stands with him; but for the other--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grimly Larry reached down and drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his uniform his automatic. He popped</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fresh clip into the pocket fold of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">girdle. The pistol he slung high up be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath his armpit. Now O'Keefe had cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned me against revealing my weapon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had, up till now, kept his own con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When we do need 'em, we're certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">104</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to have a bunch of odds against us, Doc,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had said. "And the element of surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be mighty valuable to us. Keep 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">under cover till we have to use 'em; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot straight!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Therefore I wondered why Larry was</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing his hand. The green dwarf looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the weapon curiously. O'Keefe tapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and as he spoke I understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, Rador," he said. "I like you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I believe you like us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dwarf nodded emphatically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This," said Larry, "slays quicker than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Keth. I take it so no harm shall come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the blue-eyed one whose name is Olaf.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If I should raise it, be you not in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, Rador!" he added significantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dwarf nodded again, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkling. He thrust a hand out to both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A change comes," he said. "What it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is I know not, nor how it will fall. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">this remember---Rador is more friend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you than you yet can know. And now</seg><seg type="columnLine">let us go!" he ended abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE LED us, not through the entrance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but into a sloping passage ending</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a blind wall; touched a symbol graven</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, and it opened, precisely as had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rosy barrier of the Moon Pool Cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber. And, just as there, but far smaller,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a passage end, a low curved wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing a shaft, not black as had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">that abode of living darkness, but faintly</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminescent. Rador leaned over the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O'Keefe winked at me. The mechanism</seg><seg type="columnLine">clicked and started; the door swung shut;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sides of the car slipped into place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we swept swiftly down the passage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Overhead the wind whistled. Rador turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have no fear," he began, and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the green dwarf was keen, was aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">without doubt of our lack of surprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He started again to speak, shrugged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders, and turned his back. Our speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was great and the journey not long. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few moments the moving platform be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to slow down. It stopped in a closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber no larger than itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rador scanned the wall before him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, finding what he sought, although I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could" see nothing on its smooth surface,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew his poniard and struck twice with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its hilt. Immediately a panel moved away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealing a space filled with faint, misty</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue radiance. And at each side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened portal stood four of the dwarfish</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, gray-headed, old, clad in a flowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">garment of white; each pointing toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">us a short silver rod.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rador drew from his girdle a ring and</seg><seg type="columnLine">held it out to the first dwarf. He ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amined it, lowered his rod, handed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the one beside him, and not until each</seg><seg type="columnLine">had examined the ring did each lower his</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious weapon; containers of that ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rific energy they called the Keth, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We stepped out; the doors closed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind us. The place was weird enough. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">pave was a greenish-blue stone resembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapis lazuli. On each side were high</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedestals holding carved figures of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same material. There were perhaps a score</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these, but in the mistiness I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">make out their outlines. A droning, rush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing roar beat upon our ears; filled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole cavern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I smell the sea," said Larry suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then I, too, realized that the tang</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ocean was strong. I felt its moisture</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon my face and hands. Rador spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">again to the leader of--the priests--as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I now began to think them. Four leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way and four following us, we marched</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. The floor arose gradually, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rushing roar grew louder, the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath stronger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now the roaring became deep-toned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamorous, and close in front of us a rift</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened. Twenty feet in width, it cut the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern floor and vanished into the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist on each side. The priests leading us</seg><seg type="columnLine">knelt, Rador imitating them; O'Keefe</seg><seg type="columnLine">nudged me, and we, too, dropped to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees. We arose and went forward. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore us the cleft was spanned by one</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid slab of rock not more than two yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide. It had neither railing nor other</seg><seg type="columnLine">protection.</seg><seg type="columnLine">-1---</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONQUEST OF THE MOON POOL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">105</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The four leading priests inarched out</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it one by one, and we followed. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle of the span they stopped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again we knelt. Ten feet beneath us</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a torrent of blue sea-water racing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with prodigious speed between polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls. It gave the impression of vast depth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It roared as it sped by, and far to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right was a low arch through which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was so swift that its surface shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">like polished blue steel, and from it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blessed, our worldly, familiar ocean</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath that strengthened my soul amaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly and made me realize how earth-sick</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was. Larry, too, drew himself up, draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing deep breaths. Rador uttered a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">phrase--it loses in translation its peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">picturesqueness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Holy Cord of the Navel of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Waters!" is the closest I can come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whence came the stream? I marveled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgetting for the moment as we passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on again, all else.

Then a blur of white faces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">intolerable shinings of hundreds upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of eyes. Huge, incredibly huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a colossal amphitheater of jet, a stupen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous semi-circle held within its mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc the ivory platform on which I stood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It reared itself almost perpendicularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of feet up into the sparkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens, and thrust down on each side</seg><seg type="columnLine">its ebon bulwarks, like monstrous paws.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, the giddiness from its sheer great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness passing, I saw that it was indeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">an amphitheater, sloping slightly backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">tier after tier.

And ever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiant plumes and spirals expanding, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">core of the Shining One waxed, growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater as it consumed, as it drew into</seg><seg type="columnLine">and through itself the life-force of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost ones!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So they spun there, interlaced, souls</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught in the monstrous web and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to pulse from them life, vitality,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though the very essence of natufJT was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filling us.

They drew along</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it as though half carried; in dreadful</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance; white faces sealed forever--into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that semblance of those who held within</seg><seg type="columnLine">linked God and devil.

A whirling mass of legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and arms, the dwarf flew--then in mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight stopped as though some gigantic in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible hand had caught him, and--was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed---it came to me as one would dash</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great spider, with prodigious force,</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon the platform not a yard from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Shining One!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And like a broken spider he moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">feebly, once, twice.

The tentacle</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched him, and the dull blue of his robe</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed out into blinding, intense azure</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. From the automatic in his gloved</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand came three quick bursts of flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight into the Thing.

The Thing murmured to her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to whirl faster, faster. It passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the ivory pier, out upon the waters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing with it, meshed in its light, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrifice.

The end of the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">was draped with the exquisitely colored,</seg><seg type="columnLine">graceful curtains looped with gorgeous</seg><seg type="columnLine">garlands. Between curtains and table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where sat Larry and the nine, a circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform, perhaps ten yards in diameter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised itself a few feet above the floor, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming surface, half-covered with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous petals, fragrant, delicate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On each side, below it, were low carven</seg><seg type="columnLine">stools. The curtains parted and softly en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered girls bearing their flutes, their harps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curiously emotion-exciting, octaved</seg><seg type="columnLine">drums. They sank into their places. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched their instruments; a faint, lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guorous measure throbbed through the rosy</seg><seg type="columnLine">air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stage was set!

And gradually into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voices of these crept the olden reckless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, the gaiety. But Lugur sat silent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brooding; his face like that of some fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">god; and I sensed behind the prisoning</seg><seg type="columnLine">bars of his calm a monstrous striving of</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil, struggling to be free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My eyes sought O'Keefe.

His eyes were stern, cold, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, as he turned them toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">German, filled with a curious speculation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yolara watched him, frowned, gave a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to the Hebe behind her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl disappeared, entered again with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ewer that seemed cut of amber.

She raised the glass to her lips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed it to him. Half-smiling, half-ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stractedly, he took it, touched his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips where hers had kissed; drained it. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">nod from Yolara and the maid refilled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">goblet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At once there was a swift transformation</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Irishman. His abstraction vanished;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the watchfulness, the sternness fled; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes sparkled.

Her blue eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed triumphantly; her chiming laughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang. She raised her own glass. But within</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not that clear drink that filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larry's! And again he drained his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He arose, face all reckless gaiety, rol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">licking deviltry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A toast!" he cried in English, "to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shining One, and may the hell where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">belongs soon claim it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE HAD used their own word for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their god--all else had been in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own tongue, and so, fortunately, they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understand.

Rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">was it the ancientness of the golden youth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world, love lilts of earth younglings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with light of new-born suns drenching</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Chorals of young stars mating in</seg><seg type="columnLine">space; murmurings of April gods and</seg><seg type="columnLine">goddesses. A languor stole through me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rosy lights upon the tripods began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">die away, and as they faded the milky</seg><seg type="columnLine">globes gleamed forth brighter, ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighter.

Weirdly, caress-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly, compellingly the harp notes throbbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in repeated, re-repeated theme, holding</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">within itself the same archaic golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality I had noted in the singing. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">over-4he moon flame pinnacles rose higher!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yolara lifted her arms; within her hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">were clasped O'Keefe's.

And now</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shining coils of moon fire had crept to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their knees, was circling higher--higher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And ever despair grew deeper in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What was that! I started to my feet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all around me in the blackness I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled motion. From without came b</seg><seg type="columnLine">blaring of trumpets, the sound of run</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning men, loud murmurings. The tumult</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew closer. I heard cries of "Lakla!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lakla!" Now it was at' the very thresholn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and within it, oddly, as though--punctu</seg><seg type="columnLine">ating--the clamor, a deep-toned, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">abyssmal, booming sound, thunderously</seg><seg type="columnLine">bass and reverberant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly the harpings ceased; the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires shuddered, fell, and began to sweep</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the crystal globes. Yolara's</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying form grew rigid, every atom of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming to be listening with intensity so</seg><seg type="columnLine">great that it was itself like clamor. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw aside the veiling cloud of hair, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the gleam of the last retreating spirals</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw her face glare out like some old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greek mask of tragedy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sweet lips that, even at their sweet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est could never lose their delicate cruelty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no sweetness now.

In her eyes were the fires of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit, and her hair seemed to writhe like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the serpent locks of that Gorgon, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth she had borrowed. All her beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">was transformed into a nameless thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hideous, inhuman, blasting! If this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the true soul of Yolara springing to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, then, I thought, God help us in very</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I wrested my gaze away to O'Keefe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All drunkenness gone, himself again, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was staring down at that hellish sight, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eyes were loathing and horror unut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terable. So they stood--and the light fled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only for a moment did the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold. With lightning swiftness the black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness that was the chamber's other wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished. Through a portal, open between</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray screens, the silver sparkling light</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And through the portal marched, two by</seg><seg type="columnLine">two, incredible, nightmare figures--frog</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, giants, taller by nearly a yard than</seg><seg type="columnLine">even tall O'Keefe! Their enormous saucer</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were irised by wide bands of green-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flicked red, in which the phosphorescence</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickered like cold flames. Their long muz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zles, lips half-open in monstrous grin, held</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows of glistening, slender, lancet sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">fangs. Over the glaring eyes arose a horny</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet, a carapace of black and orange</seg><seg type="columnLine">scales, studded with foot-long lance-headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">horns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They lined themselves like soldiers on</seg><seg type="columnLine">each side of the wide table aisle, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see that this horny armor covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and backs, ran across the chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a knobbed cuirass, and at wrists and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">heels jutted out into curved, murderous</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurs. The webbed hands and feet ended</seg><seg type="columnLine">in yellow, spade-shaped claws. A short</seg><seg type="columnLine">kilt of the same pale amber stones that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen upon the apparition of the Moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pool Chamber's wall hung about their</seg><seg type="columnLine">swollen middles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They carried spears, ten feet, at least, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, the heads of which were pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">cones, glistening with that same covering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from whose touch of swift decay I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">so narrowly saved Rador.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In all the chamber there was now no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound.

It was from Surtees, forwarded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me from my town address. The message</seg><seg type="columnLine">was brief but sufficiently disturbing.

Then I remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he used a gas-heater, and was mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentarily puzzled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There seeming nothing to indicate im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience or anxiety on his part, as I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">run out of tobacco, I decided to go on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the public-house at the corner--it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet midnight--and replenish my stock be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore seeing Surtees, who smoked a brand</seg><seg type="columnLine">too potent for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 strode on past the house with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">intent, when suddenly my legs became</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaden and I felt as though I were battling</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a strong head wind. Yet the murky</seg><seg type="columnLine">stillness of the atmosphere told me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">such was not the case. I strove against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unseen power which was holding me</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, but with each step it grew stronger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The street was deserted or my quaint</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggles might have roused some doubts as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my sobriety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I paused in bewilderment a ragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE "V" FORCE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tramp came shuffling along.

With odd inconsistency</seg><seg type="columnLine">I muttered "Drunk!" and, obeying an</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncontrollable impulse, I stepped back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door of Surtees' lodgings and rang the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Getting no reply, I tried the door, found</seg><seg type="columnLine">it unlocked, and, breathing slightly quicker</seg><seg type="columnLine">than usual, I mounted the stairs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked at Surtees' door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who is there?" asked a low, muffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, which I nevertheless recognized as</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of my friend, and I answered sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank Heaven!" said the voice. "Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">in--but take care--take care!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I opened the door and beheld a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Surtees lay in a huddled position on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. Close to his face--within twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches--was the bar. It shone with a dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiance, which filled the room, and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">its light 1 saw that Surtees' eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed upon it and slightly crossed as in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hypnotic trance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS I stood momentarily in horrified</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise I became conscious of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost overwhelming desire to grovel on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor also. Something seemed to draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">me forward and downward with compelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">force. Surtees spoke jerkily and as a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling breathlessly with an opponent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank Heaven--in time--I hope!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped, while I grasped the door-lintel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Discovered--antidote!" he went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a moment. "Direct sunlight--even</seg><seg type="columnLine">daylight--weakens--nights -- powerful --</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger each night-- My Lord!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He broke off with a scream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It draws life!" he moaned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had never turned his eyes to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">once all this time, and he now collapsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">limply by the side of the accursed bar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look out!" he whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first I thought he meant this simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a warning to myself. Then his real</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning flashed upon me and, bracing my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self up, I made determinedly for the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow. I reached it in a staggering, drunken</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion and, moving the blind aside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">peeped down into the street below, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head humming like a beehive the while.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three figures, including a policeman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were loitering with apparent aimlessness</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly beneath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I looked a stout man came hastening</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">along. I caught sight of his purple, anxious</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">face in the light of a lamp. When he came</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up he checked his pace abruptly and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lurched aside. The policeman seized him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and held him up, while the other two men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seemed to look stupidly on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The sound of the constable's gruff voice</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came faintly to my ear. Now came a horse-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cart, driven rapidly. Directly beneath, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">horse reared up on his haunches. There</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were shouts and a crash. The cart had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turned over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The street all at once seemed full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">people and a woman's scream rang out</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrilly. I dropped the blind and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does this mean?" I asked, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my voice shook. "Surely this devilish</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Surtees turned his bloodshot eyes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with an effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I cannot check," he whispered hoarsely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"All--London--crushed--death!

We stretched out our hands to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bar seemed to leap toward us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a sound of impact as it met our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, as though it were welded to us. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuddered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We leaped to our feet, a curious sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of power tingling through our veins. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">spell seemed to have been broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile, the sounds outside had risen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a roar, and the street was filled by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">seething, panic-stricken mob.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE back!" cried Surtees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We dashed from the room, holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bar between us. Our strength seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">irresistible. We moved as one individual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even our unspoken thoughts seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in unison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We burst through the flimsy door lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the back premises, carrying it clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">off its hinges; and I afterward found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jagged iron of one of these had caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nasty gash in my shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt nothing then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On we raced, through a yard and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a narrow lane. Then, without a word pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing between us, we burst off like some</seg><seg type="columnLine">quaint quadruped. For a few minutes we</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw no one, then suddenly we found our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves in a main thoroughfare--the Edge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ware Road, I think but am not sure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was now nearly one in the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">and very few people were about; but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dimly 'conscious of curious swervings</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the part of those we did pass, and pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently we heard the pattering of footsteps</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind us. We kept to the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, which at that hour presented few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">obstacles. We could not have dropped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar now even had we desired to do so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cfur pursuers seemed to be growing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers. They were horribly silent. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no shouts, no cries to those ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop us. Only that fearsome patter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">many feet behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We dived down a side street which took</seg><seg type="columnLine">us into an open space--Norfolk Crescent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we found it to be afterward. It might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the top of the monument for all we</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew then. Apparently our pursuers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">received a check, but, even as we paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second, the head of the procession poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the crescent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the curb stood a car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick!" panted Surtees, hoarsely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking for the first time during our</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We literally flew to the car. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">chauffeur was dozing. As we came up he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurched sidewise and fell almost at our</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. We scrambled over him into the car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, while Surtees seized the wheel with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his free hand, I started the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The vision of a wild-eyed man, clutch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing vainly at the back of the car, danced</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentarily across my vision. I reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to fling him off, and the sea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce, gibbering faces seemed to glide</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothly away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked round dazedly. We were on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad road which appeared to stretch away</seg><seg type="columnLine">into infinity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Surtees sat beside me, his jaw set like</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron, and his eyes glowing like live coals</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his knit brows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cannot we drop this infernal thing? It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is like being handcuffed," said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had no need to raise my voice.
