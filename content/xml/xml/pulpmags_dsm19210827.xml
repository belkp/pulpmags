The brim of a slouch</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat shaded his eyes and most of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. His lean figure was draped in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mackintosh that reached almost to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. The upward slant of the cigar</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamped between his teeth hinted at</seg><seg type="columnLine">total absorption in what he saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The building that claimed his atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was an ordinary three-story struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of murky brick. Flanked by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">warehouse on one side and a second-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand clothing store on the other, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented a sullen and gloomy aspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the watcher across the street. Yet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there was something in the very drab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the house and the chill atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere which hung over it that might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have appealed to the imagination of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man like Kingdon Cole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man's head and shoulders were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly silhouetted against the lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">window shade at which he was looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">so fixedly. For half an hour or longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">the figure had not stirred. The rigid</seg><seg type="columnLine">poise of the head and the stiff set of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders suggested that the man at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window was engaged in a task that oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupied his whole mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole struck a match and.'holding it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his cupped hands, lighted his dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar. The flickering light shone for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant on fingers that were long, slim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finely tapering, the fingers of a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of great mental energy and a compell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing personality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wonder what the learned Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Detective Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Carmody finds so interesting," he mum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled.

His senses, sharpened by</seg><seg type="columnLine">long training, told him he was under</seg><seg type="columnLine">observation even before he could trace</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impression to its source. Now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a limousine drawn up at the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, less than twenty paces from where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stood. Its sides of burnt sienna</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed in the blurred lights. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to lend a touch of affluence to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the squalor and dreariness of the scene.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How long the car had been there he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know, for the window across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street had claimed all his attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The car began to move, crawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">snaillike and silent toward the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Cole stood. It stopped opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway that sheltered him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancied that he saw the flicker of a face</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the curtains. Then the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened a few inches, and Cole caught a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of a beckoning hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole's eyes narrowed under their</seg><seg type="columnLine">puckering brows. The monotony of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his vigil was being broken in a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and the slow twisting of his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">signified that the interruption was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether displeasing. Once more he</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced up at the window across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street, noticing that the shadowy fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure had not stirred. Then he crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sidewalk, and instantly the door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limousine was flung wide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Won't you step in, Mr. Cole?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">a voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though his life had inured him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprises, Cole started a little. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd that the occupant of the car should</seg><seg type="columnLine">address him by name. The interior was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark, but in the shadows he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of a woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are very patient, Mr. Cole," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice continued. "You are wasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">your time, however. It isn't likely that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Carmody will go out to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, so you might as well jump in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sharp hunching of Cole's shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">registered surprise number two. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all very mystifying. Not only did</seg><seg type="columnLine">the occupant of the car know his name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but she seemed familiar with his busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness as well. He liked her voice, a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">soprano with a faintly playful under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone. For a moment he studied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, slender lines of her figure, faintly</seg><seg type="columnLine">discernible in the dusk and melting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there, into a background of</seg><seg type="columnLine">saffron-hued cushions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You hesitate? I happen to know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Professor Carmody is in for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night and that your vigilance is use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole looked at her intently. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist, the drizzle, and the blurred sheen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the street lamps seemed to lend a</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of unreality to what he saw and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you know about Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carmody," he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A great deal more than you do. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite possible that I am in a position</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give you some valuable information.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At any rate my car is more comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a dark doorway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She leaned forward slightly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a trace of mockery on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly parted lips. "Not afraid, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Mr. Cole?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave a low laugh at the implied</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare. With a shrug he stepped inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car and sat down beside her. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up the speaking tube and, turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her head away from Cole, said</seg><seg type="columnLine">something which he could not hear. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant the car was in motion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Unknown Seven</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You seem to know a great dfal,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he observed, trying to obtain a glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her face under the billowing brim</seg><seg type="columnLine">that shaded it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you are anxious to learn how</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more I know. Isn't it so. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cole? It was neither vulgar curiosity</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor adventurousness that prompted you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accept my invitation to ride with me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You accepted only because you hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn something. Having heard me</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak your name and mention Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Carmody you naturally thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might be profitable to cultivate my</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquaintance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps so," said Cole dryly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What do you know about me aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my name and my interest in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">estimable professor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A great deal," was the surprisingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">prompt reply. "You are a student of</seg><seg type="columnLine">criminology, a follower in the footsteps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Lombroso, Pinel, and Prichard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though you by no means accept their</seg><seg type="columnLine">theories. You have written two books</seg><seg type="columnLine">on crime and criminals. They are too</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific for the general reader, I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been told, but experts on the subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard them as authoritative. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">some day I shall try to read them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I fear you won't find them very in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teresting," replied Cole. "W'hat else?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You live in a small apartment in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gramercy Park, which also serves as</seg><seg type="columnLine">your office. Two years ago you did a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very brilliant piece of work on the Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merding murder case, though you mag-,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nanimously, or for reasons of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own, let the police claim the credit for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the results. You follow criminal inves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tigations largely as a scientific pursuit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If you cared to devote all your time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it you could make a great success, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you accept only such cases as happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to interest you personally. As a result</seg><seg type="columnLine">you lead a quiet and somewhat precari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous existence, deriving your sole pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure from your work and such inexpen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive amusements as books, music, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on rare occasions, the theater."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She paused. Though her face still</seg><seg type="columnLine">eluded him, Cole felt she was smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his bewilderment. The car had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned south and was running at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leisurely pace. He glanced at the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow, but the glass wras studded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">drops of moisture and permitted him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see nothing but drab stretches of office</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You seem to have taken consider-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able pains looking me up," he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I haven't told you ail I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to be living in that kind of neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">borhood by preference, because he isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">so apt to be bothered by meddling</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbors. His house is said to contain</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the best-equipped laboratories of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its kind in the world. That's only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumor, of course. The professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't encourage visitors.

She laughed gently, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">amused at something. "Besides, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtful whether a search of Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mody's house would reveal any clews</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Reeves' fate. The professor is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemist, and I understand there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain chemical processes by which</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies can be made to disappear com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely, leaving no trace."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you think Reeves has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">murdered ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you ?" she asked quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole smiled.

"There are</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways of finding out," she said mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teriously. "Tapped wires, for instance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the professor's principal reason for</seg><seg type="columnLine">staying in to-night is that he is well</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware that you are watching him. You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">see, Mr. Cole, he has more shrewdness</seg><seg type="columnLine">than you have been giving him credit</seg><seg type="columnLine">for.

The fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I happen to know more about the Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mody case than you do is no reflection</seg><seg type="columnLine">on your ability as an investigator.

The car had made several turns</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the last few minutes. He caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a blurred view of his surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, but he thought they were travers-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one of the cavernlike streets near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the southern tip of Manhattan Island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Have you heard enough?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just enough to give me an appetite</seg><seg type="columnLine">for more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In that case you must trust me im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicitly and obey me without questions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am taking desperate chances in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiding in you, Mr. Cole, and certain pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautions are absolutely necessary.

There was a flavor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mystery about the adventure that ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pealed to him, but the prospect of learn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing something more about the Carmody</seg><seg type="columnLine">case was an even greater temptation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From what little the woman had so far</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him he surmised that she must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have unusual sources of information.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Much that she had said coincided with</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he already knew, so he had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause to doubt her truthfulness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have my promise," he told her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The car made another turn, swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a dark block, then veered again</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the south. Cole caught a hazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of dark, towering skyscrapers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman looked at him fixedly, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if in doubt. "I believe you are a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your word, Mr. Cole, but promises</seg><seg type="columnLine">are sometimes broken in spite of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best intentions. Please don't be of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fended/'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She produced a scarf and with a deft</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch covered his eyes, securing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandage with a firm knot at the back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cole chuckled amusedly. He might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking into a trap, but it would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time, and he had great confi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence in his ability to take care of him-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">self in any situation that might come</seg><seg type="columnLine">UP-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After continuing its zigzagging</seg><seg type="columnLine">course a few minutes longer the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped. His mysterious conductress</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched Cole's arm as they stepped out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She guided him across the sidewalk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a few stone steps, and then they</seg><seg type="columnLine">traversed what appeared to be a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor. Finally Cole found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a narrow inclosure which he guessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be an elevator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are in one of the tallest office</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings in New York," the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered in his ear, "but you're not</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely to guess its name."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door clanked shut, and the cage</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot swiftly upward. Cole felt a rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wind in his ears. He maintained a</seg><seg type="columnLine">languid composure, but inwardly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">marveled. A modern skyscraper was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last place he would have expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman to take him to. He tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">estimate the number of floors they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing. Five, ten, fifteen, twenty-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still the cage darted upward, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then it stopped so suddenly that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught his breath sharply. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out, and the girl removed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarf from his eyes. He gazed around</seg><seg type="columnLine">him bewilderedly. All about him, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exception of a single elevator shaft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a vast expanse of blank wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no sign of doors or win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows, and the only illumination was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small electric bulb in the ceiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We came up in a private elevator,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman explained. "This is the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. To the public at large and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the tenants of the building it</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically does not exist This way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Cole."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stepped to one of the corners of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the triangular space, of which the ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vator shaft formed the center, and Cole</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed. In the dim light he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">see exactly what happened, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman's hand went out and then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow portion of the wall slid back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They stepped through an aperture, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Detective Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly the opening closed behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. They were in a long corridor</seg><seg type="columnLine">with doors on each side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surprised?" she asked, starting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead him down the hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rather. Never expected to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">such mysterious contrivances in a mod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern office building."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her only reply was a low laugh. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor of the corridor was luxuriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">carpeted; the doors on either side had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a solid appearance. Cole's amazement</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew. He wondered what was beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the massive doors and what was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature of this establishment that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden behind blank walls. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">little time for speculation, for his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion opened a door and bade him</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Excuse me, Mr. Cole," she mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mur mu red when she had switched on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light. "I shall be back directly."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door closed, and she was gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alone, Cole looked about him, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes opened wide in astonishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TEMPTATION.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pOR a moment Cole forgot that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in a building devoted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather prosaic pursuits of commerce.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The room in which he stood, bordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by walls of paneled walnut, was worthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a Fifth Avenue mansion. It struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as a bit grotesque. From an ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vator he had stepped, through a blank</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, into a magnificence that fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazzled him. It was like an "Arabian</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nights" adventure. As he looked about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him he saw quiet elegance everywhere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a taint of showiness. For some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he stood lost in admiration, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he noticed that the room had no win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows. A moment later he discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the door was locked on the outside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Despite the splendor that surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">him he was virtually a prisoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat down and smoked a cigarette,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for his strange conductress to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">return. Evidently the walls were</seg><seg type="columnLine">solidly built, for no sounds reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The air was fresh and pure de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite the absence of windows, hinting</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was a concealed ventilator</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere in the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The armchair was comfortable, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stretched out his lean figure, slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">short of six feet. The man suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental force rather than bodily</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength, but a great surprise awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">any antagonist who underestimated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cole's physical prowess. He was far</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger than the average man, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">endurance was phenomenal. His gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, with a faint humorous twinkle in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their depths, were fixed on the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His dark face, slightly lined about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth and the outer corners of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, bore a look of mild expectancy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In moments of repose Cole looked as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he had not a care in the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His friends often wondered how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to maintain the freshness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkle suggestive of a recent needle</seg><seg type="columnLine">shower. Perhaps it was because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thoroughly in love with his work</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had learned to shake off the minor</seg><seg type="columnLine">frets and irritations of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the midst of his musings the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened, and he stared rather rudely at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vision that entered. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, and she had undergone an</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing transformation since he last</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw her. He wondered whether the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shimmering gown she wore had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">designed by Poiret himself. Its deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate rose color afforded a charming</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrast to her complexion, a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous white that somehow es-caped</seg><seg type="columnLine">being pale. Standing there, with a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile on her lips, her face fringed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">an aureole of fine-spun gold, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily the most bewitching woman Cole</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rose, bowed, and gazed apprecia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively at the simple, but strikingly effec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive, ornament she wore at her throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorry to have kept you waiting,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she murmured. "Sit down, please, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Unknown Seven</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke as much as you like. I want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole sat down. He wondered if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had arrayed herself like this for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sole purpose of having a talk with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You promised to tell me something</seg><seg type="columnLine">more about the Carmody case," he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded her. "I suppose you brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to this charming place so that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have a quiet talk without danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">of interruption or eavesdropping."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She sat down a short distance from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. By degrees the smile faded from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lips. A curiously solemn expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion crept into her face. "Haven't I</seg><seg type="columnLine">told you enough, Mr. Cole?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What little you told me was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a provocation.

Won't you tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">your name?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may call me Miss Brown."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The name doesn't fit you," he ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Names never do fit. That's one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ironies of existence. For the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent, until we know each other better,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will have to be Miss Brown. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell you a little about the Carmody</seg><seg type="columnLine">case in order to get your attention. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope I convinced you that it is quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless for you to continue at work on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a case that is so enormous in scope and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presents such insuperable difficulties,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Cole." A pleading note had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">into her voice. "Can anything persuade</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to drop the Carmody case ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She bent forward a little. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands clasped across her knee, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied him intently, and Cole looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the deepest, bluest eyes he had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Efrop the Carmody case!" he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must drop it, Mr. Cole! If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew more about it, what terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">things you are going up against, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would willingly drop it without further</seg><seg type="columnLine">argument. You would recognize your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">utter helplessness in the matter, not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mention a number of other things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole was momentarily speechless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He found himself strangely impressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by her big, sorcerous eyes, full of mute</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleading and entreaty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't understand. You don't real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ize what you are saying. Why should</seg><seg type="columnLine">I drop the case ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because of the things I have told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole laughed. "They are only an</seg><seg type="columnLine">added incentive for me to go on with</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She drew a long breath. "That's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">your man's way of looking at' things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The greater the dangers and difficul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties the more determined you are to</seg><seg type="columnLine">forge ahead. You don't stop to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sider the price, or estimate the cost.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wreckage you scatter about you</seg><seg type="columnLine">means nothing to you. All you think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the gratification of your boundless</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambition. Mr. Cole, won't you forgo</seg><seg type="columnLine">your foolish pride and do what I ask?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her eyes held him despite his will.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a look of terror in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths that exerted a subtle appeal</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him. He got to his feet and tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shake off the fascination of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty and her magnetic personality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Impossible," he declared. "If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought me here in the hope of induc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me to drop the Carmody case, your</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and effort are wasted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Please, Mr. Cole!

"If you won't drop the case for</seg><seg type="columnLine">your own sake, because of the terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangers involved, then I beg you to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">so for my sake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For your sake? Really, Miss--er--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown, I don't understand. What is</seg><seg type="columnLine">your interest in the. Carmody case ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">She stepped up and clutched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. The touch of her fingers sent a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrill through him. Her eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">moist, and the curve beneath her throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose and fell with accelerated rhythm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, for my sake. I can't explain, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept to say that awful things will hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pen to me if you go on. Death would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be as nothing in comparison. Doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman's soul mean anything to you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Cole?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole looked down into her eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while her fingers spasmodically</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched his hand. Far into their blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths he gazed, and suddenly his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">underwent a change. His lips curled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trifle, and a hard glint came into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Somewhat roughly he released</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Very touching," he dryly remarked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but I don't see the connection between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Carmody case and a woman's soul."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She drew back with a little sob of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bafflement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you meant your own soul, Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown, you mentioned something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't exist," he went on sarcastically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Trickery and pretense are poor substi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tutes for soul."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shrugged disgustedly. "Your act-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing is superb, but it won't bear close</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspection. You were splendid at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little distance. Despite the fact that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am the only Kingdon Cole, as you so</seg><seg type="columnLine">charmingly phrased it, I am rather sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptible to the tears of a beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman. With your sobs and your love-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liness you could have melted a stone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if such a feat were possible. As soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I got a close view of you, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew you were only shamming. Your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes gave you away when you sprung</seg><seg type="columnLine">that choice line about a woman's soul.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps you realized you were laying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pathos on too thick. Anyway the</seg><seg type="columnLine">illusion is shattered, and all that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mains is the gorgeous gown you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearing. It is really stunning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you," she said coldly, drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping the role she had been playing, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily as she would a wrap. "No doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should have known better than to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">such methods on you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, you should," said Cole. "For,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite the little slip you made, I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve that you are really a very clever</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman. Now that we are off the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject of women's souls won't you tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me your real reason for wishing me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw up the Carmody case?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shook her head, but he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">he detected a gleam of unwilling admi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ration in her eyes. Motioning him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow, she stepped to the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened it, then preceded him down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall. Cole guessed that his little ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture was over, and he felt a twinge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of disappointment at the thought that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all probability, he would never learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meaning of her puzzling behavior.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No doubt she would try to blindfold</seg><seg type="columnLine">him again before conducting him away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the place, and he was prepared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">raise strenuous objections.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it appeared Miss Brown was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet ready to let him go. She stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">before one of the massive doors that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already excited his curiosity, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked twice. It opened quickly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">noiselessly. In a moment, before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized what he was doing, Cole was</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside, and the door closed at his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room was so dimly lighted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first he could distinguish nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare, gloomy walls. Miss Brown, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had followed him into the room, has-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened forward and seemed to melt away</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dusk, leaving him to wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">what new turn his adventure was tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Gradually, as his eyes grew ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">customed to the gloom, he was able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Unknown Seven</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">11</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">see objects with some degree of clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. He was in a long, narrow room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and what he saw was in keeping with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other strange things that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">witnessed and expcricnccd in this sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prising establishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A number of shadowy figures were</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated around a circular table in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the room. He counted seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, and at first he had a ludicrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression that there were only blank</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaces where their faces should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been. Them, as his pupils continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">respond to the strain imposed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim light, he saw that each man wore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask. It was only a strip of cloth, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny slits over the eyes, but in the dusk</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was the only covering that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed to make recognition impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again Cole was struck with a sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unreality. The men, sitting stiffly</seg><seg type="columnLine">erect in their chairs, caused him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder whether he was in the midst of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some ghostly seance. He felt their eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching him through the vents in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">masks. The gloom and the silence gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">an added illusory touch to the scene.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cole had to shake himself before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could realize that he was on the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor of a modern skyscraper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Brown stepped behind one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chairs and held a brief wrhispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation with its occupant. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter nodded, and the girl slipped away</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the door. A moment later it</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed behind her, and the man, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom she had been talking, indicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Cole was to step forward. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrug he complied, and the masked</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces stirred slightly as he approachcd.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a full minute nothing was said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again he felt the sharp and steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutiny of seven pairs of eyes. Finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who had beckoned him spoke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mr. Cole, how much will you take to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop the Carmody case?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole could not help but laugh. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, spoken with a directness and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mattcr-of-factness that left nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the imagination, had shattered the illu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sion completely. In an instant the spell</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unreality was broken. He knew he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dealing with practical men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in the habit of reducing every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to terms of dollars and cents. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">blunt reply came to his lips, but his de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sire to learn more of these strange men</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused him to hold it back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose we put all the cards on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table," he suggested. "I don't like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk business in the dark. Who are you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">and what is your objection to my con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nection with the Carmody case?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are not here to answer ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions," declared the one who seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be acting as spokesman for the others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All I care to say is that, because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peculiar combination of circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances, it is to our advantage to pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">you liberally for withdrawing from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case. What's your price, Mr. Cole?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under ordinary circumstances, Cole</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been indignant at this cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumption that every man has his</seg><seg type="columnLine">price, but now his dominant emotion</seg><seg type="columnLine">was curiosity. He- could not understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">why they seemed so intent upon per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suading him to sever his connection</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the affair, but what Miss Brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said about the vast ramifications of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Carmody case suggested that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ample reasons for what they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me get this straight," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">evenly. "You are willing to pay me my</seg><seg type="columnLine">price for withdrawing from the Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mody case. Are there any strings to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proposition ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The other chuckled dryly. "J</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't call them strings, exactly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are only gossamer threads. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">addition to retiring from the case you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are to give us a full and veracious re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port of what you have discovered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">date in connection with the disappear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of Malcolm Reeves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," said Cole. "Anything else?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just one thing more. In addition to</seg><seg type="columnLine">withdrawing from your present connec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with the case and turning the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">12</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Detective Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">formation you possess over to us, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are to come over to our side and put</seg><seg type="columnLine">your ability at our disposal.

"Your propo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion is that, for a consideration, I am to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">betray my present clients and-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Betray is a harsh word," objected</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spokesman for the group.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Truthful terms are usually harsh,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cole remarked. "Let's not quibble over</seg><seg type="columnLine">words. In addition to the amount,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which you are willing to pay me for</seg><seg type="columnLine">betraying my clients, you offer to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward me liberally for certain services</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you require.

Let me state</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we have unlimited funds at our</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposal and stand ready to pay you</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. It would be no exaggeration to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that in a short time you should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rich man if you accept our offer. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of our liberality don't you think it</seg><seg type="columnLine">behooves you to be less squeamish and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask fewer questions?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose it is in deucedly bad taste</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me to argue with a man who offers</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a fortune on a silver platter," Cole</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted. "Just the same I can't help</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering why you are offering such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittering bribe to one who is practi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally unknown in his profession."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man gave an amused chuckle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't worry about that, Mr. Cole.

You have qualities</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the average professional detective</seg><seg type="columnLine">sadly lacks, such as tact, polish, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetic personality. In short, you are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">precisely the kind of man we need. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have reason to believe that you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered certain interesting facts in</seg><seg type="columnLine">connection with Malcolm Reeves' dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance, facts which would natu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rally become our property if you came</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to our side."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole marveled at the extent of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's knowledge.

His glance wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered over the circle of veiled faces.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each of the seven men was watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">him intently through the slits in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">masks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are waiting for your decision,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Cole," remarked the spokesman</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a pause. "If our proposition ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peals to you, name your price."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole pretended to hesitate. He hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn a little more before he closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interview. He wondered how far</seg><seg type="columnLine">these men would go in their efforts to</seg><seg type="columnLine">induce him to betray his clients and</seg><seg type="columnLine">transfer his allegiance to themselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Aren't you forgetting something?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. "Do you realize that a man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been bought once will probably sell</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself again?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though he could not see, he fancied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spokesman's eyes were twinkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the mask.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have considered everything, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cole.

If such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a situation should arise, however, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would know how to handle it. What is</seg><seg type="columnLine">your price?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose you name the price you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to pay?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a craning of necks, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nods and subdued whispers passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the circle. Evidently the seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">construed his words as meaning that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was yielding. The spokesman unlocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Unknown Seven</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a drawer in front of him and placed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small package on the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twenty-five thousand dollars," he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked impressively. "If you are in</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt as to the amount, or if you sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect that I am handing you stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, you will be permitted to exam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ine it in the light."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He handed the package to Cole. "Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member that this is only your retaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">fee, so to speak. There will be lots</seg><seg type="columnLine">more coming to you if you decide to</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw in your lot with us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole felt the crisp fiber of the bills.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not doubt that the money was</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuine, or that the package contained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exact amount mentioned by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spokesman. Whatever else these men</seg><seg type="columnLine">might do, he did not think they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">stoop to petty cheating. An odd sensa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion surged through him as he weighed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the currency in the palm of his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It .was more money than had ever be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore come within his reach. Of a sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den he remembered some of the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been compelled to deny himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of his slender and uncertain</seg><seg type="columnLine">income. Until this moment, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the wherewithal in his hand, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not occurred to him that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing any of the good things in life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had accepted his privations, as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of course, with a smile or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrug, according to his mood of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a few seconds longer he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself over to thrill of possession, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he tossed the bundle of currency</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on the table. "It isn't enough,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he declared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A chorus of murmurs went around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circular table. The veiled faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained forward a little. Once again</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cole fancied the spokesman's eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">twinkling through the orifices in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Splendid, Mr. Cole," said the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">approvingly. "I didn't think twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five thousand would satisfy you, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to make sure. As a matter of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, if you had accepted such a paltry</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount, we would have broken off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">negotiations instantly. W'e don't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man who holds himself cheap. Here''</seg><seg type="columnLine">--again he opened the drawer in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him--"is another twenty-five thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. That makes fifty. Quite a neat</seg><seg type="columnLine">sum for a man whose income last year</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only a trifle over four thousand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How did you know that ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Income tax reports," said the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole took one bundle of currency in</seg><seg type="columnLine">each hand. He was no longer marvel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the surprising sources of infor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation that seemed to be open to these</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. For the moment all his senses</seg><seg type="columnLine">were centered on the wealth that lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his palms. A flash of self-revelation</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to him, and he was surprised and</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened by it. ;He had never known</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mere money could give him such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a delectable sensation. In the past, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a passive onlooker, he had smiled tol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erantly at other men's scramble for</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth. With philosophic eyes he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the money-mad procession</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweep by him. Now he found that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer touch of the currcncy sent a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tagion through his veins, awakening</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange emotions within him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sensation put an indefinable fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">into him, fear of himself and the weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness he had just discovered. Of a sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den the currency seemed to scorch his</seg><seg type="columnLine">palms. He shrugged, and the spell was</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken. With an inward paroxysm he</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung the money down on the table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not even that is enough," he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced in slightly dazed tones, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">one just awakening from a dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spokesman's head came up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little. With a shrug and an indistinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutter he once more opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawer, but Cole laid a detaining hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his sleeve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait!" he said quietly. "You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">going ahead on the idea that every man</seg><seg type="columnLine">has his price. You're mistaken. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't money enough in the whole United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States treasury to buy me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Detective Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came a hush, and then a ripple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of commotion went around the table. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">died instantly as the spokesman raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">a silencing hand. He tilted his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, and through the holes in the mask</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes bored into Cole's face. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time not a sound was heard in the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally the spokesman gave a short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemptuous laugh. "I see," he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared. "You're a weakling like most</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. You're a slave to the absurd</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing we call conscience. I had hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you were one of the rare excep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wrong again," said Cole, smiling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It isn't conscience. Anyway, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't call it that. It is only pride,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foolish pride, perhaps. I want to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">through life knowing that I can look</seg><seg type="columnLine">every man straight in the eye and tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to go to the devil if necessary. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't do that if I were to sell my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. I should become a despicable</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in my own eyes, and life wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be worth living after that. I don't sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose you understand, but that's just</seg><seg type="columnLine">how I feel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seven pairs of eyes were leveled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cole's face as his short, crisp sentences</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell on the tense air. Then came</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence, a long and oddly vibrant silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">during which Cole experienced an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">accountable feeling that his life hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the balance. He could neither under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand it nor trace it to its source, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nameless sense of danger grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">more distinct with every moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By instinct his hand went to the hip</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket in which he always carried a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, but reliable, pistol. Before his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand could touch the weapon a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing happened. The spokesman's arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">described a slight movement in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusk, and in a twinkling utter darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell. Cole stood in blackness so intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it seemed as though he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His fingers found the handle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol, but in the next instant his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell to his side. In that impenetrable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness the weapon was of no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">avail than a toy. He heard a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraping of chairs, then a patter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. He groped for the chair where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spokesman had sat, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty. Gradually the faint sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased, and then came an engulfing</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence. It was as if every manifesta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of life had been drained out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness that surrounded him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silence -- darkness -- solitude. Cole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he dropped into the spokesman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, felt as if the three words had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly acquired a new and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful significance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE TEMPTRESS SPEAKS.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">piVE minutes passed. Cole could no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer control his restlessness. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">got up from the chair and went grop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly across the heavily carpeted floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His footsteps made scarcely a sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he had a queer sensation that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness and silence were insinuating</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves into his very pores. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if a magic spell had fallen over him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could no longer trust his reason or</seg><seg type="columnLine">his senses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped short as a faint whisper</seg><seg type="columnLine">went through the dead silence. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">head thrown back and straining his ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">he listened. Again the whisper came,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trailing through the blackness like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">disembodied breath. Some one was</seg><seg type="columnLine">calling his name. He groped in the di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection whence the sound came, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now he could hear it quite distinctly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Cole!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tracing the sound vibrations, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the floor and brought up</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a wall. Again his name was</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken, and now he had an impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the speaker was only a few feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. He thought he recognized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Cole!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His highly sensitized ears gauged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissected each small fraction of a syl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Unknown Seven</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lable. He knew lie was not mistaken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The voice belonged to the woman who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had introduced herself by the absurdly</seg><seg type="columnLine">inappropriate name of Miss Brown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Where are you?" he asked. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumbled with his hands in the dark, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">found nothing but emptiness. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and ran his fingers up and down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall until he encountered a metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">object imbedded in the paneling. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">his name was called, and he gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short laugh as he realized that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds were coming to him through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthpiece of a speaking tube. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of the cold metal against his fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers seemed to shatter an illusion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Simple though the contrivance was, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">smacked of up-to-dateness. A sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">reality broke the spell which the weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">events of the night had cast over him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello," -he spoke into the mouth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece. "You, Miss Brown?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A brief pause, and then her voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to him in hurried tones that be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke intense excitement. "Yes, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cole. I must warn you. I feel respon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible for your predicament. Awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">things will happen if you persist in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your headstrong course. You must</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandon it and accept the proposition</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was made to you. Otherwise-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her voice quavered and broke. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended sentence and the words she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left unspoken impressed Cole</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly. He could almost see her, white</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shuddering at the other end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking tube. Though he knew she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a clever actress, there was an ear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nestness in her tones that gave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean these men will kill me</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless I accept their vile terms?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, they will do worse than that!</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are terrible men, Mr. Cole, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are in a desperate temper. Death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred deaths, would be preferable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the thing they intend doing. Won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you come to your senses before it's too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late ? Oh, please-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole laughed into the mouthpiece.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Compose yourself, Miss Brown. Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry on my account. I've been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight corners before, and I always wrig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled out of them somehow. I shall do</seg><seg type="columnLine">so this time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sob sounded at the other end, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then all was quiet. Cole drew away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the speaking tube. It might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been only another bit of clever acting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Miss Brown's warning had left him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a state of tingling suspense. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had hinted at dire things that were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen to him, 'and Cole tried to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself that she had only been exercis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her imagination. Such things be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed in the realm of romance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">melodrama. It was laughable to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they might happen on the top floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a skyscraper, located close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's financial nerve center. The in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">congruity of it struck Cole as quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He chuckled, but in the next instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sharply caught his breath. A sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembling that of a clicking lock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached his ears. He heard nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, but he had a feeling that some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one had entered the room, that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer alone. Instinctively he</seg><seg type="columnLine">braced himself to resist an attack. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears were keyed to catch the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound; every muscle in his body had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tension of a cocked trigger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood with his back against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, all his senses quiveringly alert.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could neither hear nor see, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew some one was steadily approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the fariher end of the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Presently he could hear sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of breathing, but the prowler's progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still muffled by the heavy carpet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now a little thud signified that the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truder had walked up against the cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cular table, so he could be no more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few feet from where Cole stood. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that he could not see who it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was coming toward him made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspense nerve-racking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he thought of matches. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">16</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Detective Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">searched his pockets, but the little case</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which he usually carried them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty. Somewhere in the room there</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be an electric-light switch, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not likely he could find it in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He peered sharply into the blackness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now his ears caught a pawing sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that of some one crawling on hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knees. He bent forward a little,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders squared, for he knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prowler was only a foot or two away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evidently he hoped Cole was unaware</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his entrance and expected to take his</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim by surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fumbling hand swept Cole's knees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he kicked out his foot with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">force, foiling the attempt to trip him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A startled yell testified to the effective-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the kick, but in the next instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cole knew that his adversary had risen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet and was changing his tac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tics. His fist struck out, but it landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a body hard and firm as rock, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only apparent result of the blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a stinging sensation in his knuckles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tried to strike again, but now his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders were seized in a powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip that pinned his arms to his side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rendered him helpless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole's mind worked quickly, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enormous weight of his adversary</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore him down. Evidently he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge man, and his arms were hard as</seg><seg type="columnLine">flails. Even if Cole's hands had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">free, his fists would have made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger impression on the man's body</seg><seg type="columnLine">than on a wall of brick. Though nim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bler and more wiry than his opponent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cole knew he could not match him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute strength and physical endurance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His only hope lay in releasing his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, striking at the fellow's face, batter</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into insensibility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He writhed and wriggled in the pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erful embrace of the gigantic arms, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisting the downward pressure till he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt as if his spine must snap. Inch by</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch his opponent was bending him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knees, and all the while his arms</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">felt as if they were caught between</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal springs. In vain he put every</seg><seg type="columnLine">ounce of strength into the struggle; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountainous body of his adversary was</seg><seg type="columnLine">constantly forcing him downward. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready his knees were touching the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his neck felt as if it were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually wrenched out of shape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His breath grew weak and fluttering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His heart pounded against his ribs like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trip hammer. In the blackness tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">specks whirled before his eyes. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the struggle must end soon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the realization seemed to kindle a flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">within him. An idea shot like a flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his reeling mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he grew limp in the sturdy</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms of his opponent. With a grunt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction the latter let go his hold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Cole lay flat and inert on his back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a few moments he drank huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulps of air into his straining lungs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, with the elastic swiftness of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring suddenly released, he leaped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet. With one hand he located his</seg><seg type="columnLine">adversary, with the other he drove a</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage blow straight into the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A short cry of pain and rage broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the other's lips. His hands fum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled at Cole's throat for a strangle hold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the merciless hammering of the lat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter's fists drove him steadily backward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whenever his fingers tightened around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cole's windpipe a rain of smashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">blows to nose and mouth forced him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">relax his hold and retreat a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther toward the wall. Cole, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength electrified by the joy of battle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not notice that his knuckles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bruised. Time and again, with a sure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of aim that surprised himself, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove them into the other's torn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mangled face. Already a stertorous</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing told that his adversary was</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming groggy. Cole summoned all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his strength for a final knock-out blow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He flung his arm backward, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same instant the other uttered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud yell. Cole cut it short with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Unknown Seven</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">17</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">crashing thrust of his fist. With a gasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">his opponent went to the floor. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he gave himself over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrill of victory, but in the next instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was all alertness. A faint click sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nified that the door had opened, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now several pairs of feet were stealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly across the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole whirled around on his heels, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stalwart form collided with him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly sweeping him off his feet. An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other hurled himself upon him from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind, and a third jerked his legs from</seg><seg type="columnLine">under him. With a sharp sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bafflement, Cole fell headlong to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. He struck out with hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, fighting with desperate vehemence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined to inflict all the injury he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could on his opponents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he was outnumbered three to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, and something of his strength had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been spent in the earlier encounter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Defiantly he met the onslaught, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was overpowered by numbers. Even-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tually they had him on his back, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then his adversaries shackled his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feet with stout cord. He thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were handling him with strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleness, and he wondered if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were saving him for another ordeal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He remembered, as he was picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carried, that Miss Brown had said</seg><seg type="columnLine">something about a fate worse than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred deaths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In silence the little procession passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a door, and presently Cole was</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed on a cot. In a few moments the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men walked out, and once more he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">left alone in impenetrable darkness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not a word had been spoken by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">captors, and he had not obtained a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single glimpse of their faces. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole episode had been enacted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence and under cover of darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door opened just as Cole's mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shaking off the numbness that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized it when he fell. Some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked up to the cot where he lay. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few moments no sound was heard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">save the slow breathing of the two men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 2F-DS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally the other spoke, and Cole rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ognized the voice of the one who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">acted as spokesman for the group</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the circular table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're an obstinate man, Mr. Cole.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We have made you a very flattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposition, and you have seen fit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reject it.

The other man laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly. "We know you are not the kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of man that's afraid of death. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing stronger than fear for your life</seg><seg type="columnLine">is needed to bend you to our will. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will bend you sooner or later. Make</seg><seg type="columnLine">no mistake about that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The words were spoken in a tone of</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm assurance that impressed Cole</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How, if I may ask?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By a form of persuasion that is far</seg><seg type="columnLine">more powerful than the fear of death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After all, death is nothing.

Perhaps I can convince you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole heard his footfalls cross the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, and then a door opened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed. For a few minutes he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, trying to arrange in an orderly</seg><seg type="columnLine">process the odds and ends of the night's</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing happenings. His mind stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered before the task, and suddenly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door opened again. He had a vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression that two men were enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and that they were carrying a bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den between them. They moved about</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly in the darkness, and now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then they wThispered in tones so low</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Cole could not hear them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A light flashed on, and in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant the door closed. After the long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">period of utter darkness, the sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare had a blinding effect. Cole blinked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes, but after a little he opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">them wide in astonishment, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight that met them drew a long, trem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling gasp from his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was only one other man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, a shivering, gibbering wreck of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man whose grimacing features and hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low cackle sent a series of chill shivers</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Cole's body. For a long time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stared into the leering, slowly twitch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing face before he was able to realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the wretch, seated a few feet from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cot, was Malcolm Reeves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      CHAPTER IV.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"yellow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          he first went to work on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of Reeves' mysterious dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance, Cole had been shown sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral photographs of the missing man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Along the numerous twistings of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail he had carried with him a mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture of a fine intellectual face, deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rather somber eyes, a long nose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose slenderness hinted at aristocratic</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeding, a clean-cut jaw that denoted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great deal of aggressiveness, and lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were a trifle too full and might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have suggested sensuality, if the broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope of the forehead had not conveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dominant impression of the student</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the thinker. The picture in Cole's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind had represented a man about fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years old, with a virile personality and</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet tastes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The contrast, between his mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">image of Malcolm Reeves and the mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erable creature now sitting a few feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">away was so sharp that the compari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son gave Cole a profound shock. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing hung loosely over his bony</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame, and he seemed to have aged dec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ades in the three weeks that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">elapsed since his disappearance. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders were hunched down a little,</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Unknown Seven</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his head was bent forward, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes stared rigidly into space, as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were seeing something in the distance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His lips were twisted into a fixed, va-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cant smile that impressed Cole as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most hideous thing he had ever seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried to spring from the cot, mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentarily forgetting that his arms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs were bound. He sank back with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutter of exasperation. Not much</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination was required to guess that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men who had brought about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own plight were also responsible for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition of Malcolm Reeves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again something drew his glance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insane man. The revolting, picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to hold Cole with an uncanny</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascination. "What's happened?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquired, realizing a moment later that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might as well have addressed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden image.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reeves was still gazing fixedly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposite wall. There was a look</seg><seg type="columnLine">of insane glee in his shrunken eyes. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent forward a little more, and then his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips began to move. "Yellow," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pretty yellow!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The soft-spoken words and the gig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gle that followed caused Cole to shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. He could see that Reeves' mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the pitiful remnant of it, was revel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in some childish fancy. The wreck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age of a once splendid intellect was hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible to behold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you see?" he asked, won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering whether the man was capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any form of response.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other's face brightened, but Cole</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it was only an external glow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reflected light rather than one kindled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from within. He recoiled inwardly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">another stream of giggling mirth</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowed from the insane man's lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yellow," said Reeves again. "Pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His expression became more rapt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His smile grew broader and deeper, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Cole it seemed nothing more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">contortion of facial muscles. He won-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dered whether the two words were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was left of the man's vocabulary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt a desire to test him and see if</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was not a remaining scrap of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tellect that could be aroused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, Mr. Reeves," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply. "When did you last see Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Carmody?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The giggling ended in a quick in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take of breath. Reeves' smile faded as</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly as if an invisible hand had</seg><seg type="columnLine">blotted it out. Watching him intently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cole could see that his question had</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched a slumbering chord in the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. Fear and something akin to hate</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazed in the shrunken eyes. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">startling transformation, and Cole ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served it in wonder. He had men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned Carmody's name on the spur of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vagrant impulse, wondering whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would awaken a recollection in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">debris of Reeves' intellect. The effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far beyond his expectations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Carmody!" said the insane man, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">each syllable cut like a knife through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silence. "Carmody!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drew a shaking hand across his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brow, and Cole fancied something was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirring in the dark corners of his mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His face took on a strained look, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was trying to exercise the shattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">remnants of his intellect. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flicker of returning sanity, a feeble ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">of awakening reason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It did not last long. Reeves gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little shudder, there was a trembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam in his eye, then the fatuous grin</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back to his lips, and once more he</seg><seg type="columnLine">mumbled in rapt tones: "Yelknv.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pretty yellow!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole turned his head away with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiver. His experiment had shown the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopelessness of the insane man's con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition, but it had also suggested several</seg><seg type="columnLine">things to Cole. A recollection of a ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifying nature seemed to be buried in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wreckage of Reeves' mind, and evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently it had something to do with Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Carmody. Cole had felt certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a long time that the professor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">20</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Detective Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible for the man's disappear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, but he had not cared to jeopardize</seg><seg type="columnLine">his case by taking action before he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient evidence in his possession, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a premature move on his part might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have brought disastrous results. At that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he had not been sure whether the</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing man was dead or alive. If still</seg><seg type="columnLine">living, his safety might be endangered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by hasty action, for Carmody would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hesitate to kill him if he thought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">advisable. So Cole had waited, pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiently biding his time and slowly, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">surety, strengthening the meshes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he hoped to entangle the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now Cole wondered to what extent</seg><seg type="columnLine">his course had been correct. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">maniac's startling reaction to the men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of Carmody's name seemed to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm at least a part of his theory. • What</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not understand was how</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reeves, granting that the professor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible for his abduction, happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be in this place of dark intrigue and</seg><seg type="columnLine">baffling mystery. Evidently there must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a connecting link between Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carmody and the seven masked men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had sat around the circular table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Likely as not they were accomplices,</seg><seg type="columnLine">banded together for the attainment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some secret object. That would at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least explain why the seven men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">so determined that Cole should drop the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carmody case, though it explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A slight sound interrupted the specu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lations with which he had tried to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve the tension he felt. He turned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head a little and saw that the door had</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened a crack. A hand was inserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the narrow opening. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment i+ fumbled over the wall, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a faint click, and once more the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was dark. Men were moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">about in the blackness for a time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then all was quiet. The silence seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to indicate that Cole was alone in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, but he had an indefinable feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some one was standing beside his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cot. In a moment his impression was</seg><seg type="columnLine">confirmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Cole," said a voice, and he rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ognized it at once, "I trust that what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have just seen has put you in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">more reasonable frame of mind. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less you comply with our wishes we</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall do to you what we did to Malcolm</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reeves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole strained spasmodically against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cords that fettered his hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. In the darkness his imagination</seg><seg type="columnLine">sketched a picture of Reeves' hideously</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinning face. For a moment he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost hear the maniac's insane cackle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He banished the vision by sheer force</seg><seg type="columnLine">of will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a great deal of finesse about</seg><seg type="columnLine">your methods," he ironically observed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I guessed, of course, that Reeves was</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought in here to serve as an objcct</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesson to me. It was quite impressive."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And you have reconsidered?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other hopefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole lay absolutely still on his back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was all he could do to exclude the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbing pictures of Reeves from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. Whenever a glimpse of it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to him he felt a weakness that put</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in fear of himself. "Not exactly,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he managed to say in steady tones. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have merely been taking my own meas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure, as it were, trying to determine</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether the loss of pride and self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect is worse than the loss of one's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanity."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what is your conclusion?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am still in doubt. There are so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many ways of looking at the situation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For instance, one thing to be considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">is that lost self-respect may be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained, while insanity is in most in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances incurable."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Excellent," murmured the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's a very rational way of looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the proposition. Such being the case</seg><seg type="columnLine">it should not be. difficult for you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">choose between the two alternatives."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But it is," protested Cole.

In order to escape a fate like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one you inflicted on Reeves, I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise anything, and so would every</seg><seg type="columnLine">other men wrhose head isn't full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonshine. You follow me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Perfectly. You are trying to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">out that we have no hold over you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your reasoning isn't bad, but you for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">get one thing. As it happens, we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a position to exact a pledge from</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, one that will hold you to us for</seg><seg type="columnLine">life."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other gave a soft laugh. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw what a hopeless case Reeves is.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's no reason why he should go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on living any longer. The merciful</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to do is to put him out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">misery."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You mean-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly, Mr. Cole. You are to seal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the promise you give us by hustling</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reeves off to a better world. We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned it so that we will be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove that you killed him. Having in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">criminated yourself to that extent, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the evidence in our possession, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">need have no fear that you will go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">on your word of honor. And now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we thoroughly understand each other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must ask you to decide promptly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our time is valuable."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few moments passed in silence, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Cole they were like weeks. Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">before in all his life had so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts and emotions been crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">into such a narrow space of time. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt weak and shaken when it was over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his voice was clear. "My answer is</seg><seg type="columnLine">no," he declared. "If I were able I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would give it to you in a more emphatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorry, Mr. Cole," replied the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I won't accept your decision as final,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however. I trust you will reconsider</seg><seg type="columnLine">before you become unconscious under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ether."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that he went out, leaving an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ominous silence behind him. Cole tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantically at the cords around his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists, but they only cut the deeper into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his flesh. He could see no escape from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the awful fate that awaited him. Time</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again the picture of Reeves' fatu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously grinning face came back to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">causing him to writhe in mental tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. A tempting voice seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper in his ear, turning his thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">into strange channels. To end a life</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was worse than a living death ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared not such a dreadful thing to do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cole himself would have preferred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">die rather than suffer a fate like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reeves'. If he should ever fall into</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a condition he would consider the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man a benefactor who ended his</seg><seg type="columnLine">misery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He shook himself violently. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">clammy perspiration was bathing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead. With a mental and physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">paroxysm he brushed away the tempta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">22</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Detective Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to which he had nearly yielded a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment ago. Footsteps were approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the door, and he knew a critical</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment was at hand. Something within</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that was stronger than reason and</seg><seg type="columnLine">logic shrank from the mere thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking Reeves' life. He wondered if</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no other alternative.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried to take a calm view of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation. Though his hands and feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">were tightly bound his persecutors evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently had not thought it necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strap him to the cot, since he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon be under the influence of the ether.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By experimenting he found that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could turn over on his sides and, thanks</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the fact that his hands had been tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front instead of behind, he was able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move his arms up and down and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a horizontal direction. Since he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not use his hands he did not see how</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could turn this circumstance to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage, yet it continued to tantalize</seg><seg type="columnLine">his imagination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door opened, and his ears told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that several men were entering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. For a time they moved about</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the darkness, as if making prepara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of some sort. After a little the</seg><seg type="columnLine">footsteps receded, and then the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened and closed once more. Cole</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed that all but one or two of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had withdrawn. After another</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief delay, the lights flashed on once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, this time illuminating a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reeves was back in the room, oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupying the same chair in which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat the other time, but now his limbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were as tightly manacled as Cole's own.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He moved his head slowly from side to</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, as if sensing something unusual in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, but his vacant stare showed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had not the faintest inkling of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a glance at him, Cole looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Not far from the cot stood a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall man with a black beard that cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered nearly his entire face. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding a number of surgical imple-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ments to the Hght, giving each one a</seg><seg type="columnLine">critical inspection before he placed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a small table with a glass top that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood beside the cot. Cole could not re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain a shudder as he saw how calmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man examined the sinister-Iooking</seg><seg type="columnLine">little tools. There was a professional</seg><seg type="columnLine">air about him that in Cole's mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamped him as a surgeon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again his glance moved to the insane</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, whose dull gaze seemed to be tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in each detail of the scene. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning of the little knives and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of the black-bearded man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrifyingly clear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The surgeon placed the last of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knives on the table beside the cot. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay there in plain view, so close to Cole</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if his hands had been free he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have reached out and touched them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The long, slender metal blades gleamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">diabolically in the electric lights, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if they had been placed like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that for the sole purpose of impressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hideous significance upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black-bearded man came closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the cot, and Cole caught a full view</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his face. He had seen it once before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though only dimly, for the surgeon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the seven who had sat in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusk at the circular table. He had worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mask then, but the black beard, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high forehead and the bald spot on top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his head were unmistakable. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">his features were unveiled, and in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstance Cole saw a grim signifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cance. The surgeon no longer had any</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason to fear that Cole might recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nize him if they should meet again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped beside the glass-topped</seg><seg type="columnLine">table and, with hands clasped at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, fixed a tranquil gaze on the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clining man. "You have one more</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance, Mr. Cole/' he remarked in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">casual tone. "Hadn't you better recon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sider your refusal ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole looked up into the bearded face</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a feeling that there was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar about it, but his mind was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">agitated to analyze the impression. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Unknown Seven</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a playful manner the surgeon picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the knives, holding it so that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light flashed against the keen blade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cole was trying to frame an answer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but just then something drew his gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the insane man. Reeves was strain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing forward in his chair, bending his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight against the fettering cords.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From where he sat he had a clear view</seg><seg type="columnLine">of both Cole and the surgeon, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were fixed with wild intensity on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knife in the latter's hand. Time</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again he opened his lips, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only sound that came was a hoarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattle in his throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Mr. Cole ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The surgeon, paying no attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lunatic, looked impatiently at Cole.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reeves, with mouth gaping and fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures horribly distorted, continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stare at the knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You refuse?" The surgeon waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment longer for an answer; then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a shrug, he replaced the knife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped aside. Cole felt a sudden rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blood to his head. If he was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape a fate worse than death he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">act at once. He spurred his wits to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of something to do. A tinkling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that of a jar or a bottle being</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved, sounded in the room. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">he bent his mind to the seemingly hope-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">less task of finding a way out, but, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this moment of desperate peril, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not take his gaze from the insane</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reeves sat with shoulders hunched</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and head turned a little to one side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now and then his mouth twisted at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners; from time to time a shudder</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke the tension of his figure. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of slight gurgling sounds fell on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stillness at intervals. All the while</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes, with a smoldering something</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their depths, were fixed on the knives</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread out on the glass-topped table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Cole's body executed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little writhing motion. His nostrils</seg><seg type="columnLine">sucked in a strong, sickening odor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a sponge in his hand, the surgeon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was coming toward the cot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more, in a delirium of suspense.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cole glanced at the insane man. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick dilation of Reeves' nostrils told</seg><seg type="columnLine">he also had noticed the ether. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair creaked as he bent his weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the cords. There was a look on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face that Cole felt would follow him</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the night of madness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatened to engulf him. Reeves'</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest heaved violently, his whole body</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be rocked by a tumultuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion, and finally a long and oddly</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrant cry broke from his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">To be continued in next week's issue of DETECTIVE STORY MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHINAMAN ACCUSED OF SHOPLIFTING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'T'O Lee Sing, a Chinaman, twenty-five years old, must be given the unenviable</seg><seg type="columnLine">* distinction of being the first of his race to be arrested in New York on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of shoplifting.

A number of minor</seg><seg type="columnLine">employees, similarly drawn to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber of death, clogged the doorway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispering excitedly to one another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">craning their necks to see what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. The bank, peacefully doz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a few minutes ago, was now buzz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was also characteristic of Shum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way that, when people around him be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came excited, he grew calm. Now, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the midst of all this frantic agitation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was cool master of his thoughts, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind was working with the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cision of a piece of perfect mechanism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heedless of the feverish babble in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, he concentrated all his faculties</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one thing alone: Who killed Reeves ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rapidly he marshaled all the known</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts, adding to them, as he inspected</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room and questioned the bank of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficials. These facts, when brought to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, were arrayed in his mind as fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows : First, Reeves had entered the di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectors' room, unknown to his asso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciates, between three and four o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">this afternoon; second, also unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his associates, or to any other per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son in the bank, he had met a violent</seg><seg type="columnLine">death there; third, so far as was known</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had no enemies and no cause to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own life; fourth, his assailant, as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suming it was murder and not suicide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gained access to the directors' room</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a private passageway which led to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor on the second floor of the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">building; fifth, since the body was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm when found, Reeves had died</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a few minutes before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Shumway mentally noted his fifth</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact it came to him that the banker</seg><seg type="columnLine">undoubtedly was still alive when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious Z had telephoned to The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Standard. This, of course, brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">him back to the important question of</seg><seg type="columnLine">who this anonymous person was, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">37</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that bred other baffling- questions which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shumway quickly classified thus: First,</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuming the unknown Z had murdered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reeves, what was his motive? Second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he had committed the murder, why</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he telephoned the newspapers</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it? Third, if he hadn't com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted the murder how had lie known</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it before the banker was dead?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These and other puzzling questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">hinged clearly enough on the apprehen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of Z, and Shumway, having made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hasty inspection of the room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioned those who might shed light</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the mystery, started briskly back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telephone, intending to call Pierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. As he shoved his way through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frightened crowd, which now filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big room, he chanced to pass near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body of the dead bank president.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He paused for a moment to gaze down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it, his brows knitted in perplexity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reeves in falling had evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck one of the heavy chairs and up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">set it. His left hand rested on a rung</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the chair, and his right arm was</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung out horizontally from his body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He lay with his head thrown back, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was apparent that a severed jugular</seg><seg type="columnLine">vein had sealed his fate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly Shumway stooped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked from the rug, beside the body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">three tiny brown objects which he per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived to be apple seeds. He quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclosed these in his palm; and then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw something that seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deeper significance, something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">piqued his interest sharply. The out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched right hand of the dead man</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched a ragged sheet of red paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shumway would have given much to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have possessed that bit of red paper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for a moment he rashly thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking it. But he knew the danger of</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing that before the coroner's arrival,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew he was courting trouble in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealing even the apple seeds. Besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Simpson and his fellow officials had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered from their shock and were now-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ejected with the rest of the crowd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shumway put the apple seeds in a vest</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket, then stepped to a telephone and</seg><seg type="columnLine">called his office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've traced the call!" Tierce jubi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantly told him.

Search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the floor he found nothing more im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant that a cigar stump and a burnt</seg><seg type="columnLine">match; he scanned the floor of the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">booth, likewise unsuccessfully. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth was occupied, and he moved on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he opened the door of the sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enth booth and looked closely at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor he uttered a low cry of triumph</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plucked from a corner a fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">apple core, recently thrown there. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the booth, closed the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which automatically lighted the lamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead, and with his thumb nail pried</seg><seg type="columnLine">a seed from the apple core and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared it with those in his vest pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They matched as perfectly as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buttons on his coat. Pocketing his pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessions he sought the proprietor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">store and quietly told him what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">38</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Detective Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. His fellow workers from</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Standard came in at this juncture,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Shumway, knowing the coroner</seg><seg type="columnLine">had probably arrived by now, left them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in charge of the drug-store "angle" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried back to the bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he entered the directors' room</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found the coroner, whom he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">intimately, examining the body of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slain bank president. Two detective</seg><seg type="columnLine">sergeants, whom he also knew, were in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">specting the room, and the doors were</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded by two patrolmen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Shumway's eyes went first of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the right hand of the dead man. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was empty. "There was a bit of red</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper in his right hand, Tom," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">casually to the coroner. "You got it, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The coroner, kneeling beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, looked up over his shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, hello, Shumway! Yes, I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paper- It's on the table there. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't make anything of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shumway's eyes, darting instantly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table, beheld the ragged piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper, and involuntarily he gasped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement. Surely this was carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing too far! Zigzagging crazily</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the red surface, in heavy black</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines, was the crude, gigantic letter Z.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UNDER TIIE MICROSCOPE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FYCRING his several years experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence in metropolitan newspaper</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, Shumway had encountered many</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar criminals, but here was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite new to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here was one who walked boldly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a bank, stabbed the president to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, left his calling card in his vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tim's hand, scattered other evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, then calmly walked out and told</seg><seg type="columnLine">the newspapers all about it and got</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. The brazenness of the thing, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say the least, was disconcerting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Examining the sheet of scarlet paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a reading glass, which he found</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the room, Shumway discerned it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of strong linen texture, that it con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained two faint finger prints, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the letter Z was roughly drawn with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft, black crayon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And now the coroner, emptying</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reeves' pockets, drew forth a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheet of like description!

The dinner-table talk in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">home that evening, centering almost ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusively on the tragedy at the Second</seg><seg type="columnLine">National, had not been conducive to</seg><seg type="columnLine">joyousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her mood, therefore, was dismal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Shumway unconsciously con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tributed thereto. For the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">since she had known him he was pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied in her presence and inatten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive to her. He was similarly heedless</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bright performance.

"Now that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you remind me of it, he did say some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about apple seeds, but I attached</seg><seg type="columnLine">no particular importance to it. The fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">is that, when he mentioned killing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reeves, I cut in with a question, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chatter about apple seeds was lost.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What do you see in it, Shumway ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">What's on your mind?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't tell you now," said Shumway</seg><seg type="columnLine">and returned to his seat in the theater,</seg><seg type="columnLine">treading on air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His plan was not so nebulous now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact it was shaping itself beautifully</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his mind, and he wras jubilant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he sat down beside Katharine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, he saw that no such joy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hers.

"Where on earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you been?" she asked, a touch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">coolness in her voice. "You missed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best part of the first act."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't care!" he answered lightly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'd far rather sit and talk with you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you'll pardon my saying so, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it's high time.

And later, when they sat vis-a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vis at a charming after-theater supper</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a sparkling restaurant, he smiled into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her starry eyes across the pink-shaded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamplit table, and wove a dream about</seg><seg type="columnLine">her loveliness. Some day, he fondly</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered to himself, she would face</seg><seg type="columnLine">him thus across the breakfast table!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When at last he reached home, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, he put all such thoughts aside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was nearly two o'clock when he let</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself into his room, for the suburban</seg><seg type="columnLine">town of Oakdale was a good twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from his lodgings, but he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately prepare for bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead he closed and locked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">40</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Detective Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">door, lowered the window shades and</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached a high-powered electric bulb</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the reading lamp on his table.

Of par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular interest to him were the marks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the teeth in the apple core and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumb print on the paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he turned out the light and got</seg><seg type="columnLine">into bed he was well satisfied with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress.

It was clear to me, then, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">obsessed by some real or imaginary</seg><seg type="columnLine">grievance against bankers.

Mr. Tench watched a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little group descend from the single</seg><seg type="columnLine">coach, his eye sifting out the aliens from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the homing native traveler. He scowled</seg><seg type="columnLine">more acidly than ever as he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">five salesmen march along the strip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade to the hotel, instead of scattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once to their work. It was after</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight, and these men had been riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly an hour, but they had waited for</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast, nevertheless. Mr. Tench</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew why: at the Mickrimmon House</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could buy a dollar meal for fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">cents. Mackrimmon couldn't seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize that prices had gone up!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ' stood in the window, thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">wdstfully of what he could do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">such an opportunity, hugging his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt for the sheriff and the community</seg><seg type="columnLine">which tolerated him. His lips tight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened and drew down as he saw Mack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rimmon leave the courthouse and come</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him, a great, swollen figure in</seg><seg type="columnLine">faded blue serge, a rusty, wide-brimmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">black hat casting a shadow like a mask</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the upper part of his red, plump</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. The man's very walk was shift-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">less, he thought. But the frown faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he realized that the sheriff was</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed for the bank, and guessed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">errand. There was a solace in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of the coming interview.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mackrimmon nodded gravely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said good morning in a slow, thin drawl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The banker answered briskly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, sheriff, what can we do for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you? Decided to sell me that hotel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mackrimmon shook his head, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a smile for the mouthworn jest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wanted to talk to you about that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lovatt sale, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, that's set for to-day, is it? I'd</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten-" Mr. Tench assumed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the expression of one preoccupied by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a multitude of concerns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--to-morrow. But I'm kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy, and I wanted to talk to you be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What about? There's no hitch, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there?" Mr. Tench spoke sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir. That's all right. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">come over to see if you wouldn't let</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on young Jeff a mite. Seems like</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's kind of hard on him to lose the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, after the way he's wrorked on it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is hard on him--of course. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to be. A man who buys land</seg><seg type="columnLine">without having the title searched, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then neglects to record the deed, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serves to suffer smartly, sheriff. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know the law, sir. It's on your</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, sure enough. Your title's good,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Jeff's ain't, and it's your land, ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cording to the court. But Jeff don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see it that way. Looks to him like you</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the law had cheated him. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's worked right hard for three-four</seg><seg type="columnLine">years on that place--cleared the scrub</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and planted peaches-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down, sheriff. I want to explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">this thing to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Tench placed a chair impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tantly.

You sympathize,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I take it, with young Lovatt, or you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be here pleading his case. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want you to understand why I'm in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisting on my rights. It's not money,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff--it's principle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pie achieved the expression of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious virtue with which he invariably</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompanied the useful word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll agree, I think, that if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't arrest lawbreakers, and if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">court didn't punish them, we'd have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great many more crimes than we do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I mean that mercy would be bad for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the community, perhaps bad, too, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the offender himself.

He's broken a law that's older</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stronger than any statute on your</seg><seg type="columnLine">books. He's been a fool. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">law of nature herself is th^t a fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall suffer for his folly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff pondered this deliber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately.

He wouldn't learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything by this experience. And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should encourage others like him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar foolishness. By standing on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">rights, I teach him that it comes high</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a fool, and I teach the whole com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munity that same lesson."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You aim to take the place away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him, then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Excuse me--that's not the way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put it.

He only thought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">did."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff nodded. The door behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him opened, and a man came in, a neat,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">alert young fellow in linen clothes--one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the arrivals on the morning train.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't let me interrupt, gentlemen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm in no hurry."

"You must misunderstand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's no criminal charge against him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's possibly guilty of technical tres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass, but I haven't any intention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">making such a charge. You have only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to dispossess him, formally-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I know all that. They's no charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him nowr. I was lookin' ahead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir. You go through with this, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll be arresting Jeff right quick."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What for?" The banker scowled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, for murder, sir.

And he's'right apt to hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he aims at, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger half turned, Tench saw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The banker tried not to believe Mack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rimmon's even, drawling speech, but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">persistent memory brought young Jeff</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lovatt's face before him, long narrow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">72</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Detective Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lean, the cheeks concaved, the eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep-set and dark and steady. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke out hotly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a fine statement to come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheriff of the county.

That's why I'm here. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only way I know of keeping Lovatt</seg><seg type="columnLine">from killing you is to go easy on him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or kill him first. I can't lock him up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on suspicion. I'd have to wait till he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got you and then go after him. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">that'd be a mean job, Mr. Tench--yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir. Right mean. I know Jeff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I take you to witness that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">amounts to intimidation!"

Mackrimmon nodded. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">only telling you what I know. Suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">you take Jeff's note for what you're out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pocket on this deal, and give him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean title to the place. Wouldn't that</seg><seg type="columnLine">be better'n waiting for a bullet the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time Jeff got a good bead on you?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teaching fools is all right, Mr. Tench,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it looks sort of risky to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger met Tench's eye over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheriff's shoulder. Mr. Tench dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinctly observed a faint, droll droop</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one eyelid. It puzzled him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose I've got to," he said sulk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily. "Bring me his note, and I'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deed ready. But I won't forget this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff. You've threatened me, acted</seg><seg type="columnLine">as spokesman for a man you admit is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">practically a murderer-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're welcome to remember it, sir.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I do the best I can.

I got young Jeff</seg><seg type="columnLine">over at the hotel." He plunged a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand into a sagging coat pocket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibited a cheap revolver. "Lucky I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw him first, Mr. Tench. A six-gun</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and a grudge and a quart of blockade</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquor mix mighty mean in a hill boy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good mornin', gentlemen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He slouched heavily out, leaving a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick silence behind him.

His lips drew back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his teeth in a flat, mirthless grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought so. You don't want me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cash a check, do you? Because I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't! What's your game?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger chuckled. "The same</seg><seg type="columnLine">as yours, Mr. Tench.

Want it to pay you?'1</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Tench gestured toward a chair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sit down and go on," he said non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">committally. But his eyes glittered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other crossed his legs comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I expect to do a little business with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the farmers around here, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to take their notes.

That's where</seg><seg type="columnLine">you come in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Tench grinned faintly, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not permit his caller to see it. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess, he saw, had been accurate.

Again his eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lid drooped slightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Tench meditated.

He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the innocent third party in a swin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle occupied an unassailable legal po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sition. And his lips went dry at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. Even when one could charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty per cent a year for a loan, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was slow business, with a small capi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal. Here was fifty, in thirty days!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"That sounds rather good/' he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. "Goon.

"Begin, anyway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll tell you when to stop."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oil stock, that's all. I sell 'em ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollar shares for ten cents, and take</seg><seg type="columnLine">their notes in payment. That enough ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Tench frowned. "You think you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could sell any stock to these people</seg><seg type="columnLine">back here? You couldn't give them</seg><seg type="columnLine">government bonds!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's my job.

You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't lose, either way. Just leave that</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of it to my silver tongue."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The banker saw the force of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">and caught the undertone of confidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the man's speech. This fellow knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could sell that stock. He must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have some special method, or he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be so sure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you work it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I'm a good salesman, for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing.

Sell 'em stock for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thirty-day note. Don't worry about</seg><seg type="columnLine">my end of it. I can attend to that."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Tench saw through it instantly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That lease would have to be signed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lessor, and his wife, too, probably.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And when it had been cut along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper lines it would become a simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">promissory note, perfectly collectible at</seg><seg type="columnLine">law by any innocent third party. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, in short, nothing but the ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">swindle of the seed-oats contract, mod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernized and improved. He chuckled as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the beautiful simplicity of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everybody felt sure there was 110 oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a hundred miles of Sparta; to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be offered real cash for utterly worth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less oil rights would seem to these hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">working farmers like a sheer windfall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'd bite--and bite hard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's see your lease," he said shortly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other hesitated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure you want to?

He had seen oil leases</seg><seg type="columnLine">often enough to recognize this as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual form. Only at the bottom, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank spaces had been left* for figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">and signatures, did he find any depar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture from the ordinary. He saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">break between the words where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scissors would cut; the note form stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">out like a framed inscription.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That seems quite regular," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">dryly.

The two men sat in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkened office, the sheriff nodding over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his folded hands. There was a long si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence.

I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">some thinkin' to do, Uncle Jimmy."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The old man shuffled away, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff resumed his meditations.

There was no sound from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower floor, as he waited in the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall, listening. He identified Mr. Lay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's room by a cheerful whistle from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind its door, and he tapped care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully at the scarred panels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Layton thrust a bath-wet head</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the hall, and shook it warningly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After supper," he whispered. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">got him, all right, but we better play</seg><seg type="columnLine">it safe.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed his soul in as much patience</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the circumstances permitted, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he waited for the brazen summons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the supper bell. His thoughts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the sheriff had really signed a pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumptive note for any considerable sum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Tench's ancient ambitions concern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the hotel were already well on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way toward fulfillment. When the note</seg><seg type="columnLine">came due there would be no cash to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet it; there never was any cash in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sparta unless it was borrowed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rufus Tench. And it wasn't likely that</seg><seg type="columnLine">any outside bank would care to loan</seg><seg type="columnLine">money on a property like the hotel. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't show a profit, on paper or oth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erwise, under the sheriff's management.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nobody except Mr. Tench himself saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">any possibility of gain in its tumble-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, paintless building.

Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body would laugh at him; Mr. Tench</seg><seg type="columnLine">was comfortably certain of this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The liberal supper he consumed pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently, he resented as if it represented</seg><seg type="columnLine">a loss to his own pocket.

He'd fire those old darkies who</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasted money in the kitchen, and put</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a businesslike cook the first thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he'd send that doddering old fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle Jimmy packing off to the Vet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eran's Home, too. He was just a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight on the business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A little paint, he told himself, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some new furniture, not too expensive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bring the place near enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">modernity to warrant doubling its pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent schedule of prices.

Lay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton shook his head again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Wait till dark," he whispered. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">be over at your office in about an hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'll drop in when it's safe. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't want to figure in this thing any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than you have to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Tench saw the force of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">advice. The fewer circumstances in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicating a close acquaintance between</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself and Layton, the safer the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequent proceedings must be. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the road and unlocked the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. It was beginning to darken, now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the filament in.the bulb over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk glowed to a feeble red as he pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the green window shades</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He unlocked his safe and extracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a compact sheaf of worn bills, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jie laid on his desk and counted lov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly. Most bankers would have re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">turned money in this condition to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasury, but Mr. Tench hatgd to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a bill being destroyed. He liked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the look and feel of old bank notes far</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than of new; there was an ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect of value in soiled, crumpled bills</seg><seg type="columnLine">which endeared them to him. New</seg><seg type="columnLine">money represented nothing but the gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment's assertion of worth ; old, hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn notes somehow had acquired an</seg><seg type="columnLine">intrinsic value. They stood for the la-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bor by which calloused hands had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrung them out of the earth or nimble</seg><seg type="columnLine">wits won them from trade. Mr. Tench</seg><seg type="columnLine">caressed the rough surfaces affection-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately as he counted. One bill had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn almost across, and he stopped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">count long enough to repair it care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully with neatly scissored strips of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gummed paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A thousand dollars, in fives and tens</seg><seg type="columnLine">and twenties, made quite a respectable</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle, he thought. It was a pity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spend it. Perhaps he could avoid even</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, if he was clever about it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">strategic advantage in the coming in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terview lay altogether with him. Lay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton was nothing but a common crook,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who couldn't run any risk of exposure;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rufus Tench was a respectable and</seg><seg type="columnLine">honest banker, whose position was</seg><seg type="columnLine">legally unassailable. Why should he</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw away a thousand dollars when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred would suffice?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He meditated leisurely over this idea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding it more and more appealing. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time a quiet tapping at his window</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass announced the arrival of his fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low conspirator he had definitely de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided to try it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Layton sidled nimbly past the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the door, his keen face alert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Must hurry, now.

Here you are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put a handful of documents on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the counter. Mr. Tench snatched at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the uppermost one.

The margins were so narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the type nearly fell over the edges,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was a note, in due legal form, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen hundred dollars, and it bore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signature of Daniel Mackrimmon. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tench was wholly familiar with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">awkward, clumsy script.

''Hurry up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother--there's no time to lose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Tench deliberately examined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining notes. They were all in or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. and each signed by a man perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">good for the amount. He knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could force collection of every penny</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their value, or, if he was obliged to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take judgment and levy on property, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could probably collect a great deal more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the face of the notes. It was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a speculation, but a sure thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I been thinking it over since this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning," he said, "and I don't feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">like going into it.

"I suppose you figure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can only afford to pay about fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">cents for this little wad of paper, eh?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't want it at any price," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Tench.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't, eh?" Layton's eye glim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered oddly. "You were never more</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaken in your life! You want it so</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly that you'll pay me sixty per cent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the face, instead of fifty. And an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other crack like that will cost you an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other ten-per-cent boost. Trot out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coin and quit bluffing. You'd buy</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Mackrimmon note at par, if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't get it cheaper. I know your</seg><seg type="columnLine">number, Tench. Think I make my liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out of this game without spotting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cheap crook when I meet one? Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">through!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Tench made a feeble attempt at</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluster.

The swin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dler glanced at his watch, hesitated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right. You get by with it," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, and snarled. "But you'll wish you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't, before I'm done with you. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">come back here and trim you right, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thrust the bills into his inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket and sidled out. Mr. Tench</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him through a gap in the cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain as he crossed the road and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the hotel. He reappared almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once, climbed into Mackrimmon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">buggy, and was driven briskly down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road and out of sight. Mr. Tench</seg><seg type="columnLine">lovingly recovered his cash from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low the safe and locked it away, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the precious notes. He was distinctly</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased with himself. He'd made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold profit of three thousand dollars--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand more than he'd expected. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">•was the best day's work of his career.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Tench was still awake ■when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sheriff Dan Mackrimmon came in after</seg><seg type="columnLine">his twenty-four mile drive. It was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most morning, but the banker had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able to sleep for thinking of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Private Lessons</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">79</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff's face when that note should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented for payment. Llis mind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of plans for the reconstruction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hotel, when it should come into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands at the auction sale which that</seg><seg type="columnLine">note would precipitate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard Mackrimmon come up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creaking stairs, and he felt his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">twist into its nearest approach to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile. The sheriff was humming</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly, under his breath, a plaintive</seg><seg type="columnLine">negro hymn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You won't see me here again;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Goin' to heb'n onna mornin' train.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My sin been taken away!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Tench chuckled. The sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">never lapsed into music except when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was in excellent humor. Probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">Layton had paid him five dollars for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all-night drive, thought Tench, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old simpleton was all swelled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">over such a profit!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He overslept and came down late for</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast, in a sullen humor. Mack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rimmon greeted him with his usual re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served courtesy, and the banker growled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in answer. In thirty days he'd have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty bomb to explode under this fat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupid fellow!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The time passed slowly, while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited for the calendar to bring him</seg><seg type="columnLine">his triumph. The last week of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">month seemed endless; every meal he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate at the hotel impressed him as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberate theft from him. In any live</seg><seg type="columnLine">town that much food would bring a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollar or more; it was assassinating</seg><seg type="columnLine">value to feed casual travelers so. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times he almost protested, and restrained</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself only by a sharp effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the thirty-first day he stopped at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office on his way out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, sheriff--there's a little note of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours due to-day.

Drop over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see for yourself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went out, hugging his exultation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lie had rehearsed the coming interview</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and over, as he waited for to-day</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come. He knew exactly what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would say when Mackrimmon came</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to the bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At ten the sheriff's big form appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his doorway. Tench bustled over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his safe and extracted the envelope in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had filed the notes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here we are. sheriff. Take a look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mackrimmon bent over the paper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tench watched him happily, waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the explosion he was sure would come.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Mackrimmon only nodded slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I kind of thought it might be that,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "When I see that feller in here</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the mornin', and come over again</seg><seg type="columnLine">after supper--that oil feller, I mean--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a notion he might be goin' to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">business with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oil?" Mr. Tench lifted his brows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This man brought me some perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">good paper, which I discounted for him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I don't remember anything about</seg><seg type="columnLine">oil. Hold on, though--he did tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he'd taken the notes in payment for</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock in some company; it might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been an oil company, too. I hope you</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't been speculating, sheriff. Oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">stocks are risky investments."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's how he worked it, eh ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mackrimmon nodded. "I was wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in' what story he'd give you.

He didn't sell no stock--all</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wanted was leases, and he paid cash</seg><seg type="columnLine">for 'em. I was with him eve'ywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stopped. These notes ain't notes at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all--reckon he must have clipped 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of them leases.

Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fought on with the ferocity of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trapped grizzly and slowly drew nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nearer to the entrance.

"Uncle Winters wants to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you're going to put in those two</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks with them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doctor Eastman says I can go over</seg><seg type="columnLine">day after to-morrow.

"Of course he's got to crawl</seg><seg type="columnLine">round on crutches for a while, but he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming out all right." Giving his horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">a parting caress he hurried toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, and, as he reached the porch</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps, he burst out: "I say, Bob, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to see Mrs. Winters working in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her gym. And you just ought to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">her put up the fifty-pound dumb-bell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gosh! Talk about strength! Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">long she's going to put up the sixty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounder for me. She wanted to do it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-day, only she hasn't got over that</seg><seg type="columnLine">banging she got the other night. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk about fencing, Bob! I tried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foils with her this morning, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't touch her, and I used that last</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunge you showed me, too. She dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed me every time she said she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to; gave me every chance and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">some!" Bob tried to wedge in a word,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but gave it up, and the enthusiastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngster rattled on: "I told her what a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crackajack you are with the foils, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said she's crazy to have a set-to</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you. And, take it from me, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't have any soft snap, either. She's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I call a real peach!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's a fine little woman, all right,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob answered, "but-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Little!" exclaimed Jim, in his sur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">prise trying to talk and whistle at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bob laughed and explained. "I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose every attractive girl's 'little' with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me; that's a weakness of mine. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">where's her gym ? We must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed it the other day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You bet we missed it, and it's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only thing we did miss," Jim replied, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he balanced himself on the porch rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and began to swing one leg. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">that little building, just to the right of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the carriage house, and Uncle Winters</seg><seg type="columnLine">hates it." Catching his brother's look</seg><seg type="columnLine">of surprise and interrogation, he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained. "That's straight, Bob, for she</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me so. You see she was always</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy to do a lot of wild stunts, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she came here there wasn't any</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to do anything. Uncle Winters</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a big kick when she asked why</seg><seg type="columnLine">she couldn't have a gym. He said</seg><seg type="columnLine">something about its being too much like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a circus, but, of course, it wasn't, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. Mrs. Winters didn't say any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more about it, because, you see, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew how he felt. But pretty soon she</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't feel well at all, and the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a big kick about its not being</seg><seg type="columnLine">right for her to cut out exercising,</seg><seg type="columnLine">right after she'd been doing so much.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And right there Uncle Winters caved</seg><seg type="columnLine">and told her to go ahead and build</seg><seg type="columnLine">what she wanted. But he's never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside, and she says that every time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">has to pass it he shuts his eyes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bob smiled and held his gaze on</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing in particular. Presently he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said: "Jim, will you keep mum about</seg><seg type="columnLine">something?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cross mu heart, Bob," said the boy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripping the railing and leaning far for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jim, I've been hearing a lot about</seg><seg type="columnLine">all this assault business," he began, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks glowing with excitement. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to turn detective. You needn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I ain't laughing at you, Bob.

''1 know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sheriff Millar and everybody else</seg><seg type="columnLine">around here thinks, but I don't believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that big convict, or the smaller one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">either, ever touched Elsie Millar or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woodbum's dog."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Search me, Bob," said the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">hero worshiper, his eyes aglow with ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectancy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When all that happened they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from here. Of course the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have been the devil who waylaid</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Winters and Mrs. Woodburn, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm not convinced. Now, I'm not going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to try to say who or what's been prowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing around or flying around and chok-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing people and dogs, but-" He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">paused and unconsciously began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">count the number of eyelets in one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim's shoes. When he resumed, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice was low and restrained. "Jim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know they found the Woodburn's</seg><seg type="columnLine">big bull terrier hanging up in a tree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now don't breathe a word about all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">to anybody, not even to the Winters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I don't want any one to know I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a stiil hunt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm a mummy, Bob."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is a new kind of stunt for me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this detective business, and I don't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get in wrong at the start.

He was kind enough until you</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried 10 corner him. but one day a big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">husky tramp got after him and had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to the hospital. Now, there wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mark on either of those convicts, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going lo leave them out, as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheriff's daughter and the dog are</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned. I don't believe they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a hundred miles of here at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. But somebody else was here, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">who?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim shifted his position on the rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, but made no reply. He knew his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brother was reasoning aloud, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not break in upon his line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sure in my own mind that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog was taken off his guard; that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lassooed and then choked to death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, you can just bank on it that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow who killed that dog started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">choke the sheriff's daughter." A close</seg><seg type="columnLine">observer would have noticed that Bob's</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement was on the increase. "Jim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you notice a fellow with a lasso</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a coil of rope over his shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other day?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim's face brightened.

"He says that scout with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rope's nutty, but that he's safe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I sounded Mrs. Winters. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">I told her that I thought that chap with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rope might be the fellow who's been</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing all the choking stunts, instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that big convict, she laughed at me so</seg><seg type="columnLine">Masked Revenge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hard I felt like a perfect simp.

When I told her how funny he</seg><seg type="columnLine">acted with me she said that he doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">often say 'boo' to anybody, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's been here for nearly a year and's</seg><seg type="columnLine">never done anything shady. But take</seg><seg type="columnLine">it from me, Bob, just the samemee, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't want to meet him alone till I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown up as big as you are!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harding gave the well-knit young-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster a look of admiration.

Instead she moved about with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiasm and apparent lightness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit that gave the lie to some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories told to him by the old servant</seg><seg type="columnLine">over at the sheriff's. When she took</seg><seg type="columnLine">him under her care and showed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the farm, or lingered with him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her gymnasium, she radiated a whole-</seg><seg type="columnLine">someness of mind and heart that proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">a greater tonic to him than the drug</seg><seg type="columnLine">prescribed by his physician. At no time</seg><seg type="columnLine">did she allude to the recent assaults</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon herself and others. Seemingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">she lived only in the present, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">charmed him by her youth and beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her spirit of frank good-fellowship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps that which impressed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">most was her great strength. Jim was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wiry youngster and strong for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">age, and he loved a tussle, the rougher</seg><seg type="columnLine">the better. Yet he was no match for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. She tossed him about as a cat</seg><seg type="columnLine">would a mouse, and, at the end of one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of their romps, she caught him by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ankles and, holding him head down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, swung him from side to side like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pendulum. Then she grasped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty-pound dumb-bell and, with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, lifted it from the floor and raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to a position arm's-length above her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. She repeated the exercise with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hjr other arm and, with the grace and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftness of a lioness, bounded from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gymnasium out into the open, cry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing joyously: "Show's over!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One evening, a few days after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning of his visit. Bob, upon enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the living room, was surprised to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see her standing by a table, rigidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">erect, her arms at her side, the elbows</seg><seg type="columnLine">held slightly backward, hands clenched.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To see her in her present attitude gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a shock. Only a few minutes be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore she had left him with her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm with smiles, and now she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting for self-control. Her back was</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him, and, in the instant of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">embarrassment, he recalled the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the old colored woman: "But now</seg><seg type="columnLine">she jes' takes on trios' de time. De ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bants, ober t' her home, dey seen her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbin' her heart oud w'en she did'n</seg><seg type="columnLine">know no one was roun'." As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched her, a great sympathy swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">through him. and he had to fight hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the impulse that was urging</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to go to her. Considering himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">an intruder he turned to go, but. as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did so, she heard him. And, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught her expression, he knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was desperate, that the spirit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfettered joyousness, that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been showing him, was nothing more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than clever masquerading.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you caught me, didn't you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked, and there was no sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">music in her voice, only defiance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I beg your pardon.

One thing, however, stood out</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly defined and dominating, his de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sire to help her. Yet there was so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might have said, so many things he</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired to express, that he dared not</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust himself to speak. She read him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as clearly as though he had spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">freely, and the wild, strained look</seg><seg type="columnLine">faded from her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know you do.

Yet he could not shake</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the thought that she was the wife of</seg><seg type="columnLine">another man, a man old enough to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">her grandfather, it is true, and who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had selfishly neglected her, but still her</seg><seg type="columnLine">husband.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish I could help you to see things</seg><seg type="columnLine">right.

Their crow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">black coats were of satiny softness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected the sunlight almost with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliancy of polished metal. One day</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heifer calf was born, distinguished</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the rest of the herd by a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot at the tip of each ear. The old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man pronounced this marking a blem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish which reduced the animal to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rank of a cull, and lit only for veal; in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his herd there must be one solid color,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that crow-black. His wife, touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the rare beauty of the helpless crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, pleaded for its life, and it became</seg><seg type="columnLine">her sole property. She named it</seg><seg type="columnLine">"White Tips," which quite naturally be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came "Tips" for short. Until she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven months old, Tips was allowed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">run with the main herd, but after that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was, from time to time, placed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large corral in which was built a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable barn. In spite of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtful arrangements, Tips was</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiest whenever she was turned into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the herd and cunningly tried to hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself in the midst of her big family</seg><seg type="columnLine">whenever the attempt was made to place</seg><seg type="columnLine">her back in her corral. As time went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on she became the pet of everybody on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the farm, including the old man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One morning she was not in her cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ral at feeding time. The foreman</seg><seg type="columnLine">called to her, but she did not respond.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He hurried to the old man for the key</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the corral gate, only to find that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heifer was not in her barn. The cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumstances of her disappearance were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar, for the corral fence was eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet high and studded on its top with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp nails, pointing menacingly up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. Close inspection failed to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">that either the gate hinges or the lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself had been tampered with. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heifer was gone and had left 110</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace as to the nature of her going.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man listened quietly to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">news, but, as he toyed with a pencil</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand shook. His first comment</seg><seg type="columnLine">was: "I hope we find her before th'</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife hears." He then directed that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful search be made through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">herd of black shorthorns, and that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">general alarm be sounded throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">the county. Then, having notified</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sheriff Millar, he sent for his fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now let's start at th' beginnin'," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "When was th' las' time y' see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that heifer?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Last night, about eight o'clock, sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I went the rounds," the foreman</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered.

"An' they was thar when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you waked me up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The foreman vouched for this state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment with a nod.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm wondering if anybody heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hounds last night.

They lacked incentive and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after yawning and stretching them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves, they kept close to the old man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last, after persistent urging, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">began languidly to move about with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their noses held close to the ground;</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet they made no sound other than that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their exhalations. When they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">within twenty feet from the little calf</seg><seg type="columnLine">barn they began to warm up. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">languor disappeared, and they became</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen for the chase. The leader bayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dashed for the barn, followed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others in full cry. Presently they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were heard from the inside, but quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">reappeared and followed the back trail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It ended where it had been picked up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty feet from the barn. Winters</seg><seg type="columnLine">encouraged them to cover every foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the inclosure, but, after a repetition</seg><seg type="columnLine">of languid, aimless searching, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally lost all interest in the fruitless</seg><seg type="columnLine">chase.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man glanced nervously</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the house. He was trying hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">to conceal the fact of his anxiety.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, too, he was fighting a losing</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle with his conscience, inwardly ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledging the truth that he had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">too gladly welcomed the injury to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ankle as an excuse for remaining at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home indefinitely.

Now, I'm not saying that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">agree with him, but then you never can</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell. Here's the part I don't like.

He don't care who</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is, and he don't care whose feelings</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hurts when he lands him. He's got</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> brains all right, but he hasn't got any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more heart than a machine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bob could feel his heart being</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed by the weight of a new-born</seg><seg type="columnLine">and intangible fear.

"Perhaps he's got you and me</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowed, who knows?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">dryly. "If he keeps on he'll have every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body round here locked up. I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's bluffing, and it looks to me as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's trying to peek through the keyhole</seg><seg type="columnLine">with both eyes. Well, let him go ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle Winters can show a clean slate."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's all very true, Bob, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds well, but it won't work out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way we want it to.

Of course he ain't got any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing on the old man, but he certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">can cause him and her a lot of trouble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just when they'll have to have a let-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">or go dippy." Sheriff Millar's eyes nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowed and there was a note of cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiousness in his voice when he added:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bob, has it ever occurred to you that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she may be just a little 'off?'

"I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't say that she's anything like being</seg><seg type="columnLine">insane, but I do believe that she's got</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself so worked up that she doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what she thinks she does. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe she really saw a gorilla at all."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What about the hounds?" Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. "You couldn't fool them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they certainly hit a hot trail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, she saw something, all right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she distorted into a gorilla."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You may be right," he admitted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But just at that moment he was not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously interested in the subject of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gorilla. His thoughts were occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pied with a more vital question. Were</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and Jarden secretly following the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same line of reasoning in the establish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of an actual clew?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alarmed and depressed, he sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brother to whom he unburdened</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. Jim was an attentive and sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathetic listener, and the freshly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed complications in no sense modi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied his belief in his big brother's ability</seg><seg type="columnLine">to unravel the tangle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I think Jarden's caught that</seg><seg type="columnLine">chap with the rope 'with the goods on,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't you think so, Bob?" asked The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not unless Jarden's got hold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that I've missed, and I've in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigated every square foot in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">county," Bob answered. Then to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngster's delight he gave his reasons</seg><seg type="columnLine">for taking issue with the detective.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The strongest evidence against your</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend with the rope is the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was once treed by Woodburn's bull</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrier. He told a gossiping old woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was going to kill the dog. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">long after that the dog was found</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangled, and the old woman swears</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she saw the fellow near Wood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burn's home that evening. That's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only evidence against him. And-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But that's real proof, Bob. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what more you want!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But there is something more, so you</seg><seg type="columnLine">just keep still. I've found out that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old woman had it in for him for a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. I don't know what the trouble's</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, but she's been waiting for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to get even. And she got it!</seg><seg type="columnLine">So don't you take any too much stock</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her. Now for point number two:</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the time when Sheriff Millar's</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter was waylaid and Woodburn's</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog was killed the fellow with the rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seen near Birdsville by three men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two are pretty sure about it, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">is ready to swear to it.

It's true that he was on hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the time when they were trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">run down whatever it was that pounced</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the sheriffs daughter, but that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">long enough after the time of the as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sault for him to have got back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Birdsville. I've got an idea that Jarden</seg><seg type="columnLine">made that arrest to keep everybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-natured. People were getting too</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot for him not to do something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show that he wasn't asleep!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You just bet that's why he jugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">that scout," declared Jim, now wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced that Jarden did not catch his</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with "the goods on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bob made no response. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking of Sheriff Millar's description</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Jarden. "I wish I knew how much</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jarden actually knows.

Jim asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an outburst of his native enthusiasm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't give Jarden a chance to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of his funny business.

I believe I'm on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right track. I was sure of it the other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">day, but if I'm not-" He did not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">finish the sentence. "Circumstantial</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence has hung more than one inno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent man, and that's all I've got now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sometimes I feel that Jarden and I are</seg><seg type="columnLine">working along the sam - line, only he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven laps ahead and still gaining. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't afford to let him strike first! Let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">run out to Brentonville.

He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been speaking very softly, and he low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered his voice when he said: "I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to act to-morrow morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The coming of the old man caused a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden change in the conversation.

He fought against sleep as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have fought against a power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful drug which, robbing him of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">guiding conscience, would have forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">him all unconsciously to the commit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of acts traceable only to the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only the night before he had awak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened to discover that he was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gymnasium, in the act of opening, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempting to open, one of the lockers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the key to which was in his wife's pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">session.

He could not tell how long he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been there, and at first he tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">convince himself that he was dreaming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The situation was uncanny. The real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ization that he had quite unconsciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered a building, the interior of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had vowed never to see, that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved and acted like an automaton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmanned him, and he began to shake</seg><seg type="columnLine">like one taken with a chill. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had last seen the candle, which he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now holding, it was on the little table</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the side of his bed, and he wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he was when he relighted it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had its rays betrayed him? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought brought him to his senses. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that the window shades were</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised, and the discovery added to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">discomfiture. He hastily picked up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">crutches and blew out the light. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only hope that he had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen, for he was proud, and the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of discovery was humiliating. A feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing akin to shame swept over him, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was just a few days ago when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had boasted that he never walked in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Putting the candle into his coat</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket he groped his way to the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cautiously peered out. He had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of the hour, but he hoped that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still too early for the hands to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gin their first duties of the day. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were early risers, those sturdy toilers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the soil. But there was no light in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of their rooms, and he knew they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were still sleeping. He felt relieved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He softly closed the door, fearful that</seg><seg type="columnLine">its faintest sound might reach the ear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some light sleeper, or rouse the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hounds. Once more he glanced about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then stole half crouching through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard. In his efforts to crouch, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread his crutches wide apart, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">losing his feeble balance, he fell. For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunately his ankle suffered no ill ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fects, and, readjusting his crutches, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went the rest of the way boldly erect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But the exertion was severe, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was breathing hard when he reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">his room. He did not undress, but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing himself upon his bed, he drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the comforter over himself and, unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sleep, lived out the balance of a mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erable night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not until the day was well ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced that he felt sure that he alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">held his secret, and the thought was</seg><seg type="columnLine">comforting. But now as he lay in bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was tormented by the fear that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might, within a few hours, repeat his</seg><seg type="columnLine">act of the night before. For a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he lay and tossed, resolved not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep. Then he dreamed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was lost in a dense forest. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">air was dry and hot and was driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him by a mighty wind. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear it roaring as it battled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the defiant, sky-reaching pines. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he himself was the wind, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with glee as he saw all things</seg><seg type="columnLine">bending and breaking under his force.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly a great cliff loomed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew he could not shatter it, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that so great was his speed he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not stop, he was doomed. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he awoke with a jerk and realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roaring of the gale was the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own labored breathing. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more he drifted off into unpleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams, again to awaken with a start.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he slept the sleep of the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted. He no longer dreamed, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he awoke with an unaccountable feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of oppression. He wondered why he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have awakened at all from such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quiet sleep. Within the house was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbroken silence, while from the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, starlit world, there came no sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His room faced the east, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked toward the window in the hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of seeing the first, faint, pink tinge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coming day. As he did so he</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught his breath with a gasp and held</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, while his heart seemed suddenly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat. Trembling in every part he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly raised himself to one elbow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked.

He was ly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on his right side, with his legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly drawn up. The left leg extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little beyond the right, and he resisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">an impulse to draw both of his knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his chest. To have done so would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have afforded him a sense of relief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wanted to draw the bedclothes over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head, they seemed, just then, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">only means of protection. But he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not stir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw the thing sink slowly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight and knew it was crouching.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something touched his left foot and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rested there. Then it moved, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the pressure of fingers pass lightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his ankle and steal softly to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knee. There the hand rested and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently, slowly moved its fingers. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man wanted to cry out, yet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not stir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hand left his knee and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly to work its way up his thigh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After an age it reached the hip and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to feel about the bedclothes. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the while the thing had remained out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sight. Then stealthily, noiselessly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared the head, the broad shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huge black body. A hound barked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the thing withdrew its hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank out of sight. Its movements were</seg><seg type="columnLine">as silent as the passing of clouds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man could control his breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing no longer. His breath forced its</seg><seg type="columnLine">way through his restraining fingers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud and rasping. He tried to cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact of his distress by pretending</seg><seg type="columnLine">to snore, but the attempt was a failure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was more like a stifled groan. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">barking of the hound ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more the thing loomed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed and leaned slightly over and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly placed its hand upon the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's hip, but not to remain there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly the thing drew so close that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man could hear it breathe. Pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently it moved a hand across the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, brushing thew atch and the silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor. Next it quietly pushed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, brushing the watch and the silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">close that its breath touched the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the old man. Then the hand reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shoulder and rested there. The old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man wanted to draw away from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, yet he knew that he must lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly still. A sense of suffocation</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcame him, and involuntarily he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly drew his knees to his chest. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew that on no account must he</seg><seg type="columnLine">again stir. Holding himself in ago-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized restraint, he dug his fingers into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bedclothes.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">Masked Revenge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">103</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that he must cry out; he knew he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to cry out.

His observation</seg><seg type="columnLine">was brief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The thing crouched and glided</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man had passed the point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">human endurance.

"There</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be some natural cause for his ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traordinary color. He can't be simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">perpetrating a hoax.

Presently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without having glanced toward the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow, he sauntered into the adjoining</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor.

"I merely want to learn where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">has gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff was acquainted with Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">White. He had often seen him going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to church on a Sunday with Mrs. Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll's youngest servant, a pretty mulatto</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, named Eliza Black. Their names</seg><seg type="columnLine">had always seemed to him to be ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surdly antithetical, for Sam White was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very dark, and Eliza Black almost fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">by comparison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, to tell the truth, sheriff, I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know where Sam has gone," Mrs. Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll admitted. "He asked permission</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go away for a week or two about</seg><seg type="columnLine">a month ago," she explained. "I gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him some money and told him to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead and enjoy himself as it was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first holiday."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did he say where he was going?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cudworth inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He did not," Mrs. Cudworth said</seg><seg type="columnLine">more gravely. "He was very reticent</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did he say?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He stated that he had a little scheme</seg><seg type="columnLine">in view, strictly private, and that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to investigate it. He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell Eliza about it, either."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did he say wdien he would return?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Probably in a week or ten days was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way he put il. He admitted, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, that it might take a little longer."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Have you heard from him during</seg><seg type="columnLine">his absence?" Cudworth's calm blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes had narrowed slightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only once," said Mrs. Carroll.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Eliza received a letter from him three</seg><seg type="columnLine">days after he left. The poor girl is</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreadfully anxious about him. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps he has been killed by that terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">madman we are hearing so much about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She made herself so ill over it that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Doctor Wykoff yesterday. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">prescribed for her, and said he thinks</seg><seg type="columnLine">the madman will soon be caught. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, he is spending much of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">time trying to catch him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I heard so this morning," Cudworth</seg><seg type="columnLine">informed her. "Did he say why he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">specially anxious to secure the man?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He did not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He may want to diagnose the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traordinary case," Cudworth allowed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"experiment to learn the cause and cure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of so singular a malady. He has a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very strong propensity for that sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very true; that same propensity has</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him quite famous," Mrs. Carroll</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminded him. "You may question</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eliza if you wish, sheriff, but I feel sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">she can add nothing to what I have told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you.

"Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know what he wrote to Eliza ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not a word relating to his little</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme, or regarding his whereabouts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did say, however, that he was with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a friend, that he was feeling fine, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he reckoned as how she wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know her big stick of licorice when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back home/' Mrs. Carroll told</seg><seg type="columnLine">118</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Detective Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him, laughing. "That was just the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">he put it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know where the letter was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mailed?" Cudworth inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In North Shelby," Mrs. Carroll</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly informed him. "Eliza called my</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to the postmark.

Cudworth smiled a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">oddly. "No, I won't question the girl."</seg><seg type="columnLine">he added as lie rose to go. "You know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Carroll, I've always thought pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">well of Sam."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not ?" she inquired.

It was after</seg><seg type="columnLine">six o'clock, and he figured that Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wykoff probably was at dinner with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">family, and that lie could make the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigations he had in view secretly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cudworth strode on more rapidly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon brought up at a low wall in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear of the physician's extensive estate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was about a quarter of a mile from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woodland road where the green man</seg><seg type="columnLine">first had been seen. The sheriff de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced a point from the last, and hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">from observation by the intervening</seg><seg type="columnLine">orchard, a stable, a garage, and a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">cement laboratory, all of which occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pied the rear grounds, he began an in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">spection of the earth on both sides of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cudworth soon discovered what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seeking, several footprints corre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponding with that of the much wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. lie found them on both sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wall, and he soon observed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of them pointed away from the estate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and toward the distant woods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not one points toward the place,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he muttered. "Plainly, then, he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">come this way and afterward depart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead, he only left in this direction and</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped toward the woods. The space</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the tracks shows plainly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was running. Directly in a line from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory, too. Humph! I'll find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out about that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sprang over the wall and stole</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the orchard, where apple and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peach trees were in blossom, sweet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful in the softened light of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting sun. He paused at the rear wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the laboratory, where he briefly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spected two ground glass windows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered through a small hole where a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece had been broken from one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">panes. He could see indistinctly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">slats appeared to be nailed across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window, and that the room contained a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cot on which a wrinkled blanket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillow were lying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cudworth's features had hardened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stole around to the front door to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure it was locked and that the building</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unoccupied. Then he returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear and quickly broke the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">window sufficiently for him to open it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and enter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He climbed over the sill into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelved closet, where there were count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less bottles, phials and jars, each labeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a red sticker. It obviously was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a closet in which poisons were stored</seg><seg type="columnLine">for safe keeping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cudworth found the door unlocked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, and he entered the adjoining</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, a spacious, finely equipped labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory. He had no immediate interest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the details of it, but hastened into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Study in Green</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">119</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">small rear room, instead, where he soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">confirmed his suspicions. Stout slats</seg><seg type="columnLine">were nailed across the window casing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cot and the room itself were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some disorder. In one corner was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas extension case containing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantity of clothing. The most of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not been worn since it was laun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cudworth crouched in the corner to</seg><seg type="columnLine">examine the garments. The sun had set</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the light in the room was waning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but after a brief search he found what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was seeking, the man's initials on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the linen shirts. He was so in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent upon his inspection of the garments</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had no thought of an intruder</seg><seg type="columnLine">until a threatening voice spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you doing? Get up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff sprang up as if electrified,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned sharply toward the door, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Doctor Alexis Wykoff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"What are you doing?" he repeated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Put down that gun." Cudworth</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed him sternly without moving. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">may go off by chance. You may end</seg><seg type="columnLine">with killing me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You broke in here like a thief," Wy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">koff accused him with increasing sever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity. "If I were to kill you, Cudworth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could justify it in any criminal court."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Could you justify it in your own</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscience?" Cudworth demanded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How about that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man with his liberty menaced, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">reputation at stake, with his entire fu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture involved and the happiness of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">home and family, does not confer long</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his conscience," Doctor Wykoff re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torted. His voice trembled slightly, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he still maintained a threatening atti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put down the gun," Cudworth re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated. "You don't intend to shoot me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wykoff, or you would have done so at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. Men bent upon murder don't stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">to discuss the crime, or to point out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their victims the occasion for it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What are you doing here?" Wykoff</seg><seg type="columnLine">again demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to learn what you know about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam White," said the sheriff bluntly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why do you suppose I know any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know you do," Cudworth said</seg><seg type="columnLine">sternly. "He has been confined here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That barred window tells the story.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These garments, one bearing his ini-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tials, establish his identity. Come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">your senses, Wykoff, and come across</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the truth," he advised. "What ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perimental trick have you pulled off on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam White, that has caused him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose his head and turned him as green</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a melon? Come across. Shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">me won't get you anything."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doctor Wykoff drew up stiffly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed his pistol on the cot. "I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">intend to shoot you, Cudworth, as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">inferred," he said coldly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's more like it," said the sheriff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I would not kill you, Cudworth, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other man, to save my soul from</seg><seg type="columnLine">perdition," the physician repeated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now you're talking, Wykoff," Cud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth said approvingly. "What the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deuce is the meaning of all this? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know you have something to hide, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">you would have come forward at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a frank and open statement. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes without saying, Doctor Wykoff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I'll do anything that I can for you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cudworth assured him in a kindly man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner characteristic of him. "If it is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to suppress-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No more of that." Doctor Wykoff</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked him gravely and drew back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory. "Come this way, Cud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth, and sit down.

There is a point, you know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond which a physician is not justified</seg><seg type="columnLine">in experimenting on a human subject. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went a step too far."</seg><seg type="columnLine">120</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Detective Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suspected it," Cudworth told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they sat down in the laboratory.

"I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped that I would, but I was not sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">in what condition I would find him, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">how violent he still might be. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I entered quietly and discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. I had my pistol only to awe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">intimidate him. It's a singular case,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cudworth, and a most deplorable one."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tell me about it," said the sheriff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll do all I can to aid you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're very good." Doctor Wykoff</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanked him with an appreciative nod.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I must not go into the details at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time. It would take hours for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to state the scientific features of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case. I will tell you the superficial facts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, and later give you all of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">details."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very good," Cudworth said approv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly. "That may be sufficient."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is by no means a new thing, sher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iff, for human beings to make altera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions in their personal appearance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes which they regard as improve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments upon nature, or which fashion</seg><seg type="columnLine">arbitrarily dictates. It began in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garden of Eden and has been continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every country and by every race up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the present day. Beauty is really</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of taste and custom. Small</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet is a requisite in China. The Fiji</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islanders dye their hair various bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors. Stained teeth and nails, painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies and--but, Lord Harry, why at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt to enumerate them!" he broke off</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly. "You know all that as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I." '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly." Cudworth nodded. "Go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's common enough right here at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home," Doctor Wykoff continued.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Women paint, pencil their brows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stain their lips. Specialists study the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem of removing wrinkles and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telltale traces of approaching age. One's</seg><seg type="columnLine">complexion is often one's chief con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cern. Observe my own. I am very</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark and swarthy. That is one reason,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, why I have made a special</seg><seg type="columnLine">study of the skin and sought ways and</seg><seg type="columnLine">means to modify the pigment causing</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's color and complexion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I follow you," said Cudworth. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">anticipate what is coming."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Quite likely." Doctor Wykoff</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled faintly. "The color of the skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">has always held .an important place</seg><seg type="columnLine">among physical criteria of the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">race. Physiology explains color as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequence of climate and even diet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This pigment, or coloring matter under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the epidermis, or rather under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second skin, is not peculiar to the Ne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">groid or other colored races, but is com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon to all human beings. It is simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">more abundant in certain people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I understand," said the sheriff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I must come to the point,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Wykoff said, stiffening. "I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been trying for a long time to find some</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to reach and modify this coloring</seg><seg type="columnLine">pigment so as to permanently alter one's</seg><seg type="columnLine">complexion. I thought I had succeeded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both by means of an ingredient taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">internally, and by the injection of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemical composition into the skin. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have invented an electrical machine with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the injection may be accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plished, somewhat as tattoo work is</seg><seg type="columnLine">done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Having faith in it, I was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to get a willing subject for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment. I realized that my reputa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion would be placed in jeopardy, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt so sure I was right that I resolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">to risk it. It so happened, however, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subject came to me voluntarily."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How did that occur?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It appeared that Sam White heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">me discussing the possibility of altering</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's color with a friend one day," Doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor Wykoff explained. "Well, he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me a little later and wanted to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I could reduce his color, as he put it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the physician. "I asked him why</seg><seg type="columnLine">he objected to it. He said he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Study in Green</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">121</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">specially object to it, but that he was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">love with a mulatto girl, Eliza Black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who joshed him a good deal about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">color, and that he feared she would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry him because he was so dark."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see." Cudworth suppressed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told Sam I thought it could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done," Doctor Wykoff went on gravely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I also was perfectly frank with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I told him he would be taking a chance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was only an experiment, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very anxious for the operation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sam is very fond of Eliza," Cud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth remarked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, to make a long story short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cudworth, I consented to attempt it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the physician. "I bound Sam to</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolute secrecy." He paused, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged his broad shoulders remorse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. "Well, I performed the opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.

If he could be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brought here where I could give</seg><seg type="columnLine">him proper treatment, I feel sure I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">restore him to his normal condition. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other hand, I will be hopelessly en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangled-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop a bit!"

The flushed little face, with tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes closed and red lips parted slightly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was framed in the mass of dark curls</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the pillow. Carl was asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor little fellow !" said the gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erness, leaning over and gently closing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the child's lips with her fingers to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duce a more natural breathing. "Poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby boy! One thing, at any rate, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know and will always be able to remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber: he's had a better time since I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been here than he ever had before, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his five soul-starved years!" She</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled with a mothering tenderness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How breathlessly he hangs upon those</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories of mine, and how eagerly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks forward to bedtime each night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just for me to tell them!" She crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the wall and pulled the cord which</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduced the light to a dim glare; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she tiptoed out of the room and closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eunice Gay had seen other children</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had claimed her sympathy and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">pity, many of them. But they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the poorer classes, and their needs</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been physical and material. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carl Dodge, with the best of food and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing, with the luxurious, airy sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundings of the Riverside Drive apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and the park along the shore,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">where he took his daily airing, little Carl</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the surest waif of them all. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing that was missing in his life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except in so far as she, his hired gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erness, gave it to him, was the loving</seg><seg type="columnLine">care and the sympathetic understanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">which are. far more to a child than all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the privileges of wealth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carl's mother had died too long ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to remember; so the frosty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced Mrs. Meath, the cook and house-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper of the establishment, had told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. And Rufus Dodge, his father and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eunice Gay's employer since a month</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago, seemed to have no spark of warmth</seg><seg type="columnLine">or feeling in his nature. His business</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be the center and sum of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life. The girl wondered if all bro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kers, all financial people, were as cold as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rufus Dodge, and a protest rose in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. What could any man find more</seg><seg type="columnLine">important, more enthralling, than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">love and confidence of a little child,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially his own ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But these were no new thoughts to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, and she put them out of her mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she made for the telephone in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">living room and called a number which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from almost daily repetition, had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come very familiar to her. Save for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sleeping boy and Mrs. Meath, wrho</seg><seg type="columnLine">was preparing a late dinner, she w7as</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone in the apartment. The butler,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was the cook's husband, acted occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sionally as chauffeur for his master, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his absence wras nothing unusual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello," said Eunice into the trans-»</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Blocked Get-away</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mitter.

There she took up a book</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she had been reading and settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an easy-chair, the light over her</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. But her mind did not im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately revert to the book. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought again of the youngster in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next room, of the pity of it all. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungrily he listened to the stories which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she told him! And even in his play it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not the expensive, elaborate toys</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mechanical contrivances in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he chiefly delighted, but rather the sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple set of blocks which she herself had</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought him, the blocks bearing pictures</seg><seg type="columnLine">and letters stamped on their sides, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he was already beginning to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the alphabet. They had cost her only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quarter, yet Carl had played happily</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the afternoon with them, under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big, sunny window in his father's study.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It occurred to Eunice that the blocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">were still in the study. It would not do</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have the father stumble over them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He made no allowances for the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a child in the house. She rose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the lighted hall to the living</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and then w^ent to the study. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocks lay piled in a fantastic "house"</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the window. The girl spread out</seg><seg type="columnLine">her apron, a badge of her position in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the household, to form a bag to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. When she had gathered them all</seg><seg type="columnLine">she switched out the light and made for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open door of the living room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly she stopped and stood rigid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she heard some one enter the living-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room from the hall. Before she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">start again a voice came to her. "Well,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that ought to draw a herring across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail!" It was the voice of Herbert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meath, the butler and chauffeur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hush!" Her employer's voice came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her. "She might--where is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meath, in a lowered voice, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet plainly audible through the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, replied: "In her own room. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked from the hall. Her door's shut,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you can see the light over the tran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">som. She always spends the evening in</seg><seg type="columnLine">there reading."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just look again, then, to make sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eunice Gay instinctively drew back</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall of the study. Her dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery now would cause embarrass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment at the very least; she must remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, she's in there, all right," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meath.

It must have been the breeze</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattling the shade, thought Eunice</seg><seg type="columnLine">thankfully. She had left her window</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The living-room lights were snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, and Eunice concluded that Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dodge and the butler had seated them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Dodge, "to-day's little</seg><seg type="columnLine">business ought to make things perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe. Not that any one had begun to</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspect, but the fact that I myself have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been victimized by the notorious gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bond thieves ought to prevent any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one from suspecting." He chuckled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It will be in all the papers to-morrow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had the police in, and a reporter or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two asked to see me, also.

Call him at his house; I'll</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">talk to him when you've got the connec-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Eunice, shrinking breathlessly against</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the wall in the next room, heard the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">butler turning the leaves of the tele-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">phone directory. Instinctively her eyes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turned in the darkness to the square</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">safe in the corner of the study. There,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unless she was greatly mistaken, there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was the hiding place of Barlow's bonds,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and no doubt of others, belonging to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">various owners who had suffered re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cently from what had become a regular</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">epidemic of thefts!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Beverly eight-three-o, party J!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The butler repeated the number to him-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">self.

A few-</seg><seg type="columnLine">small jobs of a routine nature, mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumbs from the table of a large agency</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had formerly employed him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the only bits of business which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had yet come his way, except for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bond-theft affair. And in that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of volunteer, working without</seg><seg type="columnLine">compensation, unless he should succeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in getting the necessary evidence against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the criminal or criminals. In that case</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rewards offered would more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">compensate him for the time he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent, not to mention the prestige which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would accrue to him.	s</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That he would succeed he felt con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fident. He had stumbled upon a clew</seg><seg type="columnLine">which apparently had escaped the police</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the other detectives. In following</seg><seg type="columnLine">it he had directed his suspicions squarely</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Rufus Dodge, a broker and specu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lator, a man of apparent respectability</seg><seg type="columnLine">and integrity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But between the clew, which, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, lay largely in Maxwell's own intui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and actual evidence remained a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulf so wide that it seemed impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bridging. The detective would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been utterly discouraged, and, in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been, until Eunice Gay had sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested a method of getting close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspect without putting him on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard. What a brick Eunice was! Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">because a girl was engaged to a fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no reason why she should give up</seg><seg type="columnLine">her time and convenience, make a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of menial of herself, and run, besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a possible risk to help her fiance in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">business matter. If they succeeded--</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, neither of them believed in long</seg><seg type="columnLine">engagements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just the same, it was hard to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her up there in that apartment with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man who was a criminal and who</seg><seg type="columnLine">might become a desperate one if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should discover the ruse that was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">perpetrated on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was thoughts like these that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">led to the arrangement of the telephone</seg><seg type="columnLine">126</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Detective Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">signals. It was bad enough not to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to see Eunice at all, but he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least hear from her every day and</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that all was well with her. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmless-sounding code which they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed on meant nothing at all except</seg><seg type="columnLine">the single fact that when he heard from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her he could know that she was safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unsuspected. It had not seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">feasible to arrange for any elaborate</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of communication. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl had any important disclosures to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make, or any urgent need of consulting</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him, she was to notify Maxwell in</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance and manage to get out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house and to a public telephone booth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which she could talk unreservedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Last night's message had been such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointment, the first that she had made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> George Maxwell paused in his pacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked at his watch. Ten o'clock!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He frowned nervously. For the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hours he had stuck close to the of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fice, his ear attuned for the tinkle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telephone. When Eunice had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the appointment she must have had rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son to think that she would be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away to keep it. And she had said</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten o'clock at the very latest! But per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps his watch was fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The slow, measured tones from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell of a downtown church came to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No, the watch was not fast. But surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eunice would not fail him after making</seg><seg type="columnLine">so definite an appointment. If her plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been upset, she would feign illness</seg><seg type="columnLine">or manufacture some other excuse to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get to a secluded telephone. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she wTas not one to forget. And she</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have information to impart, im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant information. Had she, in get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting it. unwittingly exposed herself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suspicion of her employer? Could</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything have happened to her?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the minutes ticked on George Max-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well became more and more nervous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His fears refused to be quieted. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">five minutes after ten he sat down at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk and lifted the receiver of the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone. It would not be especially dan-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous to call up the home of Rufus</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dodge and ask for Miss Gay. Who-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever answered could have no inkling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his identity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waited patiently while centra*! rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">the number. At last he received her ul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">timatum: "They don't answer." Slam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming the receiver on its hook, he got his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat and started from the office. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, she might call later, but his fears</seg><seg type="columnLine">would brook no delay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he reached the Riverside Drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment house, he was in no mood</seg><seg type="columnLine">for diplomacy. After all, he could pose</seg><seg type="columnLine">as her brother, since nobody knew him</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. Even if the whole plan w-ere</seg><seg type="columnLine">given away, it was far more important</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know that Eunice was safe than to</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeed in trapping the bond thief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slipping a coin into the hand of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniformed hallboy, he asked him to call</seg><seg type="columnLine">up Mr. Dodge's apartment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ain't nobody home there, boss," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not home!" George Maxwell felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sudden terror. "How's that?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Night man says they all done went</seg><seg type="columnLine">off on a trip last night. He helped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry down their suit cases.

But self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">recriminations would not help now.

"Can't we get into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flat?" he asked breathlessly, "to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find out where they've gone?

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was little in the outer rooms to indicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything unusual. It was only when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came into the bedroom of the child</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the empty, pulled-out bureau draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers gave evidence of a hurried flight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other bedrooms presented a simi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar appearance. No convenient time-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table lay anywhere within sight to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clew to the present or intended where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abouts of the refugees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the room which Maxwell identi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied as Eunice's there was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he could possibly construe into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a message for him. Some of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">dresses and personal belongings were</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered about the room, but he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that she could not have left vol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">untarily. Of course, it might be pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible to find the taxi driver who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken them to the station last night, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would consume time. Besides, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was inconceivable that Dodge would fail</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cover up the trail before it was many</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours old.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little study back of the living</seg><seg type="columnLine">room seemed to afford the most promis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing clew. Here was the safe, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tug at its closed door showed Maxwell</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was locked. Some scattered re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceipts and papers on a table near it led</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to think that the contents of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong box had been sorted and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them carried away. The very furni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of the room seemed to indicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a struggle had taken place there!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was it here that Eunice, alone and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to summon help, had put up a sin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gle-handed fight against a criminal made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate by the knowledge of discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery? George Maxwell shuddered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">impotent rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had been here, at any rate. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stooped quickly to the floor to pick up</seg><seg type="columnLine">an object which he recognized. A num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of child's building blocks were scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered over the carpet in an irregular</seg><seg type="columnLine">semicircular arrangement. On top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them was the article he had no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticed: an engraved platinum bar pin</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had seen a hundred times at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eunice's throat!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He picked it up, made sure of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">identification, and dropped it into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket. His eyes searched the floor for</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other article which might have es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caped his first scrutiny. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing there, nothing but the square</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocks with the letters of the alphabet</seg><seg type="columnLine">on two opposite sides and pictures of</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals on the other four.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he seemed to see a signifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cance in the blocks themselves, in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangement. Every one of them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned so that a letter was upward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the first four letters, reading from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left of the semicircle, were "Gone!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had an insistent feeling that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on the verge of a discovery, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">called the officer's attention to what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw. But the rest of the letters seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make no definite sense. It might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mere coincidence that every block</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a letter turned upward, instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a picture, and that the first four letters</seg><seg type="columnLine">spelled a word. Perhaps they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus arranged by the child who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">played with them. Yet Eunice had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in this room not many hours be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore ! She might have had an opportu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nity of arranging the blocks in a way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal a meaning to him. Why, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the top of one of the blocks, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifth one, that he had taken her bar pin!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that was scarcely a likely place for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pin to fall during a struggle. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">she left it purposely to attract his at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention? If so, what was the key by</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he could read her message, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">128</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Detective Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">less the message had been interrupted</seg><seg type="columnLine">before she could complete it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another detail bore itself in upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">groping mind. Unimportant and gro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tesque it seemed, but each block had</seg><seg type="columnLine">one letter stamped in red and the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">in blue. And the ones that spelled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word "Gone" all had their red surfaces</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As quickly as the thought came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him he stooped and turned over every</seg><seg type="columnLine">block which had a blue letter upper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most; he could scarcely wait until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had finished to read the result. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">red letters now, from left to right, ran:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"GONECHIONET N "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment he puzzled.

Your natural tendency</seg><seg type="columnLine">is to be domineering, you know, and the taste of power that you have had has</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been especially good for you. Best thing you can do is to face the situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">squarely, own to yourself that this is the trouble, and try to take a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude toward everything and everybody, including yourself. Remember this:</seg><seg type="columnLine">the finer and better a man is, the greater ability he has to obey and to give his</seg><seg type="columnLine">employers respectful attention and loyal service. Since you like the work itself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strive to put yourself more into accord with all those with whom you are asso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciated.

Your nature is excessively proud, excessively sensitive, excessively</seg><seg type="columnLine">reserved, and these qualities have been exaggerated by your home training. No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, I don't think it a tragedy when a woman has to work. I think the tragedy</seg><seg type="columnLine">is when she doesn't and won't!

How can I strengthen my will? How can I develop my resources</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that I will not be so affected by every little incident of life? Your tendency,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see. is just to twist and turn and complain while you never really take a step</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward or actually do anything.

You would find that you would like the work, but you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to make up your mind that you would put in at least two years earning less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than you do now.

Six to eight feet square floor space, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not less than eight feet high, would suffice for ten males and thirty females,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is the usual proportion.

Heavy curtains of awning cloth should be attached to the outside of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch, up under the eaves. They are kept rolled up during the day. but pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and securely fastened at night, except during the hottest weather. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are also used to darken the porch when the young ones begin to be taught their</seg><seg type="columnLine">songs, as birds should listen to their instructors in a shaded place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The instructor is a matured male singer, who is kept out of hearing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young birds until the day when they are taken from their mothers. Hmvever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best plan is to take the mothers away from them, leaving them to acquire</seg><seg type="columnLine">their education in the first home. The mothers will be all the better off for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short period of rest before going into the breeding of the season's second batch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   When the instructor is to be brought to the youngsters his cage should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept quite dark until he is wanted.

The result will be at least an hour of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant song, especially if the sun is shining brightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The performance must be repeated day after day, the young birds soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to imitate the teacher's simpler strains. At this j&gt;eriod the keeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">should listen very carefully to the performances, and as soon as it is apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">that two or three are the best singers of promise, they should be put in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">place by themselves, and the first and best moments of the teacher should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">given to them, for they are the ones which will produce the real artists, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">will, consequently, bring the largest prices.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Good, vigorous hen canaries, kept in such an open-air home, or transferred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it as soon as the weather is suitable, will bring off three nests each season</seg><seg type="columnLine">without harm to themselves, and may be active breeders for four or five years. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nests have from four to six eggs, and as infant canaries are not really as</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult to raise as young turkeys, the amount of profit to be derived from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">number suggested--thirty females and ten males--will be by no means a light</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, especially after the first year.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO BE CONTINUED.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HID DOPE IN HAIR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A FTER the police had found a small bottle of cocaine which Michael Allico,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventeen years old, had hidden in his hair, they trailed the youth to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment and then raided the place.
