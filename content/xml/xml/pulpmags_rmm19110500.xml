The</seg><seg type="columnLine">moral effect of Cromp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's act was in nowise</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessened.

The first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, Crompton took all of his men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scoured the desert, but the robbers undoubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly left the country on one of the G. and</seg><seg type="columnLine">T.'s own trains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second time, in an attempt to profit</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his former discomfiture, he put all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men guarding trains and terminals, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thieves rode out of Arizona and into Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexico on nothing fleeter than some broken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down pack-mules.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, Crompton really did make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake each time--as any one else in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">world might have done--but, unlike many</seg><seg type="columnLine">another man, on finding himself hailed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">praises later on, he did not forget. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps Crompton's ideal of efficiency was</seg><seg type="columnLine">really too high.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At any rate, he worried over those fail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures, strove to improve himself along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines of his weakness, and about every two</seg><seg type="columnLine">or three months he w'ould come into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office of Brasfield, manager of the G. and</seg><seg type="columnLine">T.'s Transmountain Lines, and would say</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him: "I hain't sure that I'm the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">feller in the right place after all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To this, Brasfield, who was a big. rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of highly developed commercial in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinct, always made this sort of answer:</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Go along with that, you big simpleton!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't want any Sherlock Holmes!

Again, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">locate all the hiding-places of the organized</seg><seg type="columnLine">bands, and he had a fairly good idea of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trails leading thereto from well-known Hole-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in-the-Wall to the more obscure fastnesses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Horseshoe in southern Utah, and The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roost which is in western Arizona.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So far as his limitations would allow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he was not a ready or a close reasoner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had gained some familiarity with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">processes of deductive reasoning as applied</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the detectives whose names appear in</seg><seg type="columnLine">best sellers, and as the crowning achieve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of all his researches, he had formu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated a theory by which he hoped some day</seg><seg type="columnLine">to retrieve for his early mistakes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His theory was this: Some day, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who had robbed the G. and T. would</seg><seg type="columnLine">look back to their ease of escape and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clude that it might be safe to try again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To be sure, he knew that they would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">try unless they could work some scheme to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get his attention directed elsewhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crompton was not quite an egotist in this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He really believed that if he were in an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">press-car with a repeating shotgun in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, he could stand off all the robbers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever got together for a hold-up. It was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause he believed this that he had made it</seg><seg type="columnLine">win, and believing that train-robbers are</seg><seg type="columnLine">rational men, not running up to a man just</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get shot, he felt very certain of his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusion that they would make an effort to</seg><seg type="columnLine">outwit him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">588</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hey would make some sort of demon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stration in a given place, and when he went</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">0	to see 4b0Ut it, they would strike in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an°ther garter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">F • TM VPton confidently expected all this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'-'Toting, he had planned how to meet it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">, »n the first place, he would send some of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">-eliable young men with the train that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nndits evidently designed to attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ie would go himself to the scene of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">demonstration, find out who of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jang had done this part of the work, and,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">afterward, he would keep that man under</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">such close surveillance that, in time he would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be able to connect all of the band with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the fact of crime, and convict them to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">last man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It must not be supposed that Crompton</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended a robbery to take place.

Approaching wi^in forty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, and still well out of th£-zone °f 'ts</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays, he sat down and listened.

Finally, realizing that the engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite deserted, he crawled up into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cab and made himself comfortable on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer's cushions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did this very carefully so as to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turb ..nothing.

He knew Mr. Tink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Tinkworth was about the most unregen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erate old rascal along the whole line of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">G. and T. He was somewhere past sixty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of age; had never done an honest</seg><seg type="columnLine">day's work in his life, but always had</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, and when not actually doing some</seg><seg type="columnLine">devilment was drunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Moreover, he was an exceedingly clever</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rascal,- always wriggling out of his mis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deeds entirely, or else getting off with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very lightest of punishments. He always</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had some sort of a plausible excuse which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tickled the jury. Once, when he had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">arrested for stealing a horse, he had made it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">appear that he only wanted the halter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">While guilty of stealing small articles, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had never committed a crime that would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">approximate grand larceny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Therefore, Crompton wanted to get away</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">without being discovered. He believed, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">every one else did, that Tinkworth must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be hand in glove with all the rascals in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">country, and reasoned that if the old fellow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">learned that his part in the stealing of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">engine was known, all communication be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tween him and his confederates would cease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  To be sure, Crompton could place him</seg><seg type="columnLine">under arrest for theft and "sweat him,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that wasn't the way Crompton wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work. Moreover, Tinkworth was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sort of man who perspired information</seg><seg type="columnLine">freelv, either as to his associations or enter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       J &gt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">prises.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Beyond doubt, it seemed wise to hurry</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.

Are you going to \tant any extTa</seg><seg type="columnLine">trains, or men, or anything?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Naw, nothin'.

However, suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">recalling the theft of engine No. 1192, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I've looked into that," Crompton re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied with the nearest approximation to van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity he had ever been guilty of, "an' be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween you an' me an' the gate-post, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine was takened jist for a blind.

He found nothing except evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of old Tinkworth's masterly shrewdness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were several piles of old iron in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back yard, some ragged bales of discarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubber-boots in the kitchen, and in various</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners and odd nooks of the other room</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pieces of brass castings.

I was ordered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to him and learn the trouble. Mounting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wagon-master's little mule, Ned, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">started for the bluff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While riding up the steep incline from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ravine, I thought I heard firing, so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">put the spur,, to little Ned and sent him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the top at full speed. As I came out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bluff, the picket was dashing toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">me on foot. The report of firearms was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now plainly heard, and the dust caused by</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets was flying up near the fleeing man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. He had deserted his mount.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While I stood watching, I saw the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall.

Who-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever was doing the shooting was under</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover, so I looked in the direction from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the shot had come and saw a head</seg><seg type="columnLine">duck down behind a shelf of stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All over the prairie in the vicinity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fort Wallace there were ridges of soft sand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone. Over to mv right there was a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge of it. and I judged that the attacking</seg><seg type="columnLine">party was behind this ridge, and that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were approaching the wagon camp from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">602</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The poor fellow ahead of me was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying quite still.

My left</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg was struck four inches below the knee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew it would be the height of folly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to warn the camp. I dismounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, leading my mule, tried to get into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On arriving at the edge of the long bluff</seg><seg type="columnLine">that led down to the cotton-wood camp, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">last hope of getting back to my comrades</seg><seg type="columnLine">left me. On both sides of the ravine were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red devils. They were not in great</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers, but they were sufficient to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">my retreat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I made a dash for the table-land. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians did not seem to be worrying about</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, so I took the way leading toward Fort</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wallace, and prepared to run the gantlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">as best I could. I rode clear around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stony ridge, keeping as far out as possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lying down on the side of my mule.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I came in sight of the outlet through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I must dash if I intended turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly toward the fort.

The mule is one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most sure-footed animals. At one time, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">little mule made a jump that must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been fifteen feet out and downward. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected that we would both land with</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken necks, but we were still going over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground at good speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mules do not like Indians, and Ned had</seg><seg type="columnLine">an interest in this affair. As we began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascend the bluff on the other side, ten In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dian horsemen confronted us and opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. Their aim was poor, for I was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck. I did not return their fire just</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, having left camp with only my two</seg><seg type="columnLine">six-shooters. I had not taken a gun with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, which was a great mistake. But I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not suppose for a moment that I would go</seg><seg type="columnLine">further than to ascertain the truth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">picket's story and then report back to camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I saw the Indians in front of me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I turned to the left, and throwing myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the left side of my mule, rode toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wagons in that position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had a good line on the Indians, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">let them understand that I had shooting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">irons by letting three broadsides into them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I must have hit some, for one stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and others gathered around him.

Ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me was a little gulley that seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead to the level plain beyond. I rode into</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and kept looking to the right and left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoping almost against hope to be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get to the level prairie with a fair start for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had not gone far when a shower of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets came from all sides.

It was dark and a drizzling</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain was falling. I tried to make out where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was. I soon began to make out objects</seg><seg type="columnLine">more plainly, and noticed a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">" feather-heads " near me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not move or speak, but lay perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">still. I found I was not tied. Then I tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn if I was badly hurt. The leg that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hit was a little sore, but there were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones broken. Further investigation proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the ankle of my other leg was badly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sat up with my arms and head on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees and began to think. I tried to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">out where I was and how to get away. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not hope to move unless I could get</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the back of a horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was in a bad fix; one I had always</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreaded even more than death.

Sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting near a big bundle of buffalo robes was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speaker. If it had not been for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiery red hair and his short turned-up nose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might have been taken for one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages, for lie was dressed like the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not look in my direction, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew from his first words that he was talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at me, or rather, singing at me. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune was one I had often heard under more</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorable circumstances. It was " The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pretty Maid Milking Her Cow," but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">words ran like this:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       Now don't let on you know me,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      But I know you--ahem !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       For you are Mr. Bobby West</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       Of old Troop M.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked at him, and, perhaps, I smiled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anyhow, he went 011 singing, making up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most remarkable verses, so the Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not understand that he was giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">me instructions just what to do. First he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me what to do--to make out that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very sick, and could not stand or walk;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could not help me now, but would</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as he had a chance. Then he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on singing. I recall these words:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       I hope God put it in your mind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       To bring along your mouth-organ</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       These devils like that kind of music</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       So play it all you can.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      Who--who--too-too-too-de--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        You're with " Standing Otter's band."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        Don't look behind you,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       No matter what you hear or see--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      Hum--hum--te-dee, te-dum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        If you try to speak to me,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        They will kill us both.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this was sung in a kind of a chant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with frequent pauses, while the singer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">working on a pair of moccasins of green buf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">falo hide.

I had shot at the Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, no doubt, killed one. I was pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that Peter had not. It was more prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able that a year or two before he had wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered into their camp, little knowing or</seg><seg type="columnLine">caring where he was going.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly my surmises fell to the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I remembered that unless it is in self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">defense, an Indian will not attack or injure</seg><seg type="columnLine">a red-headed man.

At night, when all</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still, I tried to wriggle over to a pony</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stood in a dejected attitude near by,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was no use.

This made me feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">very blue, especially about the middle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the afternoon, when we began to meet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">runners from the Indian village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some were mounted on fleet little colts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while many of the squaws were on foot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with heavy loads of fresh-killed meat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their backs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed strange to me then that none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bucks of our party offered to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bundles for them--but this is not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian way of doing things.

Whether I was guilty of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cause of the lamentations, I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, and had no way of finding out. for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peter Farrell had disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night he turned up again.

Peter had so much to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sing that he was soon out of voice. Putting</seg><seg type="columnLine">my trust in God. I went to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had lost no opportunity to bathe my</seg><seg type="columnLine">lame ankle and the bullet-hole, thus re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducing the swelling in both and causing</seg><seg type="columnLine">CAPTURED BY CHEYENNES.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">605</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">them to heal rapidly. Although my stom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ach rebelled against the stuff the Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">called food, I tried to eat to maintain</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength for the first chance to get away</seg><seg type="columnLine">or get killed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had given up all hope of help from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peter. When I made any indication for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his assistance in escaping, he seemed scared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to death, and repeated that if I did get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away they would be so mad they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill him to square matters. I wondered"</seg><seg type="columnLine">how he could be so contented with those</seg><seg type="columnLine">filthy people. From time to time as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sung to me, I learned that he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up by the Indians while tramping</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the old abandoned North Platte</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, and as he had no arms and did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to hide, they took him along. He soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to work with a few shoemaker's tools</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had with him and made the chief a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of a half moccasin and half shoe out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of green-tanned buffalo-hide, and this es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tablished him as shoemaker for the tribe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could talk quite a little of their gib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berish, and he seemed to like them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For my part, although not wanting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make matters any worse, I had to draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line on poodle soup. When it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sitting around a big pot of dog stew</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plunge and struggle for such titbits</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the short little legs and stumpy tail to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick, as is done at weddings, I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">quit!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Indian has but one good trait--</seg><seg type="columnLine">bravery. He is game to the backbone, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighter to the core.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression "Indian bravery" has become</seg><seg type="columnLine">the measuring stick by which we size up</seg><seg type="columnLine">all other kinds of courage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, I waited patiently to make my es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape.

As it was, they did not even tie me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From what Petter caroled to me one day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found out that one reason why I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been disposed of sooner was that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">village was supposed to be at peace, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the government agent would soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">call and distribute blankets for the cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All day long, however, I kept giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">them good lively tunes, " Money Musk,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Marching Through Georgia," "The Red,</seg><seg type="columnLine">White and Blue," and "A Life on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ocean Wave." The music also helped to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">keep up my own spirits, but when the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down and the squaws lit the fires, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the sounds of deviltry by night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hen the fiends began their dance, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, then leaping faster and faster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieking and writhing as they circled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crackling flames--and I often expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the rising sun would illumine naught</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me but my ashes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I kept cool, however, and was always</seg><seg type="columnLine">planning and watching. Oh! if Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farrell could only disappear for a day and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get word to the fort!

Stripped perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">naked, they rode out to the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, and the whole tribe was present to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My two guards were no exception, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they kept a good, close watch on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my movements, they were attracted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I began to squirm around as if eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the sport, but all the time shaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">my course toward a good-looking American</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse with " U.

The others</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so far behind that I did not fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, for it was getting late, and darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">would soon be with us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was riding toward what looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big rock, but it turned out to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cone - shaped mound of dirt.

I well knew that, pound him as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might, he would soon slow down to a dog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trot or tumble--but I had already planned</seg><seg type="columnLine">what to do when flight was no longer pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced back at the naked savage. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows behind me were growing longer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was not yet dark. I could see only</seg><seg type="columnLine">this lone Indian. I could hear his pony's</seg><seg type="columnLine">short, hard breathing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not shoot. I lay on the srde of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my horse, but he should have been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fetch me with an arrow at that distance--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not more than seventy yards. The knoll</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just ahead, and my hopes were high;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in one leg I had a bullet-hole, and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other a sprained ankle; and my horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beginning to stagger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lashing him once more into a wavering</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallop, and keeping a good grip on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mane, I slipped from his back and on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">lame legs ran by his side. Be it known</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a good man on foot can easily outrun</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tired horse--even if it is ridden by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pain was frightful, not so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the wound as from the sprained ankle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The horse kept me from falling. I held on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his mane until my foot became numb</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would bear my full weight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were now about fifty yards apart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, behind me, I could hear the Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">quirting every possible inch of speed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his gasping pony. I looked back, let go</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the horse's mane, and ran with all my speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the top of the hill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On gaining it, I looked back and saw my</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse eating grass, while the Indian, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reached the foot of the hill, had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to follow me, but was riding around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the base of the hill to head me off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His pony was about as winded as my</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse, and, as the red gentleman seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be unarmed, I was not much afraid of him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, as he went on around the hill, I doubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him and ran back to my horse. Out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight on the other side of the hill, the Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent forth shrill war-whoops to guide his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They would soon be here. I snatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horse's bridle over his head and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run along and lead him, but he proved"</seg><seg type="columnLine">balky, so I left him and struck out on foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">down between the steep banks of a small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry water-course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That bloodhound had not seen me, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore off in an entirely new direction. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was^now growing dark. I kept on through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the winding gulleys, never going to the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ridges if I could help it, for an ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject moving along the sky-line can be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">far away--even at night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knew that I had little or nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear from the Indian. His finding me</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a mere chance. In the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not follow my trail, and, besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was able to make almost as good time as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though my wounds hurt, I had to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving. If I rested, my leg would get so</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff and sore that I would not be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All night I went on. Two or three times</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought I saw a mounted man. I stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">still a moment, but must have been mistaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">--for it was never so dark but I could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen any large object moving on top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was now gray in the east, and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet come to the Arkansas. I expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">at every turn to see the valley where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river was, and it was nearly daybreak when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found myself plunging through the tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry grass which, in the plains, is a never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">failing sign of water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daylight found me still in this grass--at</seg><seg type="columnLine">times as high as my head--but I could find</seg><seg type="columnLine">no water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I	was so utterly tired out, and my leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">pained me so badly, that I lay down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to sleep. About noon the burning sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">awoke me. Observing nothing to hide from,</seg><seg type="columnLine">608	THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">11	pressed on. I was both hungry and dry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thirst was the worst of the two. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">first I made little progress, but after a while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I limbered up and kept up a good three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile-an-hour gait for the rest of the day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still nothing to eat, and no water. Along</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward night the grass began to grow short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er. I must have traveled parallel with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, or else this was the widest valley I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever struck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon, however, I was out where I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">look around me--and I was mighty glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I saw a small shanty about half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before I reached it I saw the shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">water of a good-sized river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After drowning my thirst I stuck my</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot in the cool water, lay back on the grassy</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank, and again fell asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a good road along the river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I felt comparatively safe from my ene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mies, as the Indians seldom traveled on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads. When they attack trains or camps</seg><seg type="columnLine">they always make a sudden dash from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluffs which line the river valleys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this time the Overland stage did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">run on the lower Arkansas.

I entered, found a bunk, and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded to spend the night there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I lay down, but soon heard a noise. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened, but could not make out what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was.

I made a dash, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was soon marking good time down the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning it seemed as if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides of my stomach were rubbing together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I started forth I noticed little camp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires at my front.

He listened to my story, and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided that I had been captured by a band</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Cheyennes which had been sent to Silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">Creek to await the government agent, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to send them to a new reservation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the way of it," he said.

The out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come of the night and the plausibility and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindness of the man had taken more shapes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her not too well-developed mind to enable</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to settle on any one as a possibility.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fulward had decided on his plan. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no time like the present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Minnie," he said, bending still closer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">" I am in great trouble, and I want you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">help me.

Now, do you think</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can do a decent job of flagging?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daily's tone was fatherly; but it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to disobey his orders.

They dragged them clear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the track, and left them. The track was</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocked up where the wheels had crushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the ties, and the front trucks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the third car were pulled back on the rails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daily worked his men deliberately, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly a glance at his watch, for it is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">well to hurry men by reminding them just</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much time they have left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fifty minutes, and they were ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">start. Sargent was called in and the train</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed on through the desert. Daily and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sargent hung over the railing of the rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform of the caboose and watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dunes steal softly by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It's a God-forsaken country," said Sar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent, shivering at a breath of chill air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I'd like to ride through those dunes some</seg><seg type="columnLine">day," mused Daily thoughtfully. " It must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a queer place.

Cars left on</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind sidings had been run through the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">railing-switches; water-tanks and coal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chutes had been emptied on the ground by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mysterious hand, and a great many other</seg><seg type="columnLine">destructive happenings had occurred dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the week.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you make of all this bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck?" asked Daily, eying Sargent to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the question was impertinent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Blackmail," breathed the chief clerk</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if his heart chilled at the mention of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word.

He guessed that in a contest for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Hood's favor Sargent had lost his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his temper and had been vanquished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the couple swept by him, Daily saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the man had dark skin and hard fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures. For a few moments Daily felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in life had gone wrong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " A Mexican!

" Then, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberately, "a greaser!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The smoky light faded and long shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang out of the corners of the room. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancers whirled into a dim circle and dwin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dled away, leaving a face with a straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose and a gleaming smile, topped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff, black hair, standing out like a por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trait 011 a canvas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the will that had driven a broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">body from end to end on the division</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped him and cleared his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A puncher from the south--or a gam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bler," he decided more calmly. " Anyway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to try to stop him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daily stepped forward quickly when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">music ceased and stood before Glen Hood</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she sat down. The first quick look of</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt and estimate she gave him as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his request hurt him more than any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else had hurt him in years. In that</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance she really took consideration of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time, and judged him. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she accepted him, and the Mexican melted</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with his gleaming smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They danced twice together, then Freddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dyer, the second-trick despatcher, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Daily strolled out to the veranda.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he turned slowly out of the doorway</seg><seg type="columnLine">he noticed, in the moonlight, four men</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered at the far end of the veranda. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned idly against the railing, talking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, insinuating tones with glinting teeth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daily also recognized the back of Sargent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The little group stood almost montionless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening tensely to the speaker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daily paused doubtfully. A call-boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched him on the arm, holding out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">book. The conductor saw that he was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take an extra east in an hour, and signed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the book. Then he strolled down the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">veranda.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard the Mexican's low laugh, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Sargent double up grotesquely in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing light--saw him strike out passion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately, blindly, an amateurish blow at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexican's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daily drew in quickly. The Mexican's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose streamed blood as he came upright with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a springy jump.

In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">box car between the engine and the caboose</seg><seg type="columnLine">were four horses.

After</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good deal of searching about in the sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">they found where the Mexican had landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his feet, bounded forward a few steps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then plowed up the sand in a hard fall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His trail began there, dragged across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert, and was lost in the shimmering heat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Get out the horses," ordered the sheriff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"From the swing of his feet that fellow is</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty well in towards the mountains by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time.

"That canon is narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and high, and once in it we're in a hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">for sure. If the Mexican had won through</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right he's sure to have picked up some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his men, and may be waiting for us."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Shall we go in?" asked Daily quietly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Oh, I guess so," answered the sheriff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they rode forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They made the first turn, and the canon</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay there blankly before them.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">two rifles spoke sharply from above, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheriff threw himself clear of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse as it went down. One of his men</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at his side in another moment. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauled the sheriff up behind him, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two horses clattered swiftly out of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daily was left alone. He cleared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">width of the canon in a swift sprint, sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at a handful of dry shrubs, caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and pulled himself up among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks, where he lay for a few moments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The marksmen above began to pester him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with bullets that spat uncomfortably close.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daily glanced upward along the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">640</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD M*AN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tain wall, then began slowly to climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher to a spot more on a line with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marksman. His progress was followed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steady, persistent spit of bullets, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was an hour before he plumped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting behind a huge boulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bullets pecked about him for a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">while longer, then ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Those fellows will about move around</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they can get me going and coming,''</seg><seg type="columnLine">commented Daily, idly fingering the loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones, " and then where am I ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He scanned the bare walls above him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then peered out at the rocks which concealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marksman. The range was too great</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his revolver, so he lay down and watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the mountains above and below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After an hour, he caught a movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">far to the left. A second later, a bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw dust in his face. Another bounced</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the rock a little above his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daily threw himself into a small niche, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust his revolver forward. He fired at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next puff of smoke, and for the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">few moments answered shot for shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He played for time and darkness.

He drew down nearer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A shot gently touched Daily's coat-sleeve.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daily crowded more of himself into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">niche, but the next shot came from a dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent angle, and cut his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Ouch! " protested Daily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dry, mirthless laugh came from behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boulder. Daily watched the big rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">with restless eyes, and when a gun-barrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed over the top of it, he promptly fired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rifle slid from sight, then reap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared cautiously around the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulder.

The blue barrel came slowly in sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Daily fired three times quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and held still and tense waiting for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinging bullet from the rifle to strike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, and no sooner, would he rush the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man on the other side of the boulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the pause his eyes swept the moun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tains swiftly. The shadows were become</seg><seg type="columnLine">long and dark in the low land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Why didn't he fire? His heart beat off</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the seconds distinctly and audibly: One,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">two, three. His restless eyes turned down-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ward in a racing glance. Then his caught</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">breath went out in a long, slow whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The impossible had happened. A sad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle-horse, strayed from others belonging to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outlaws, came slowly down the canon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulling at tufts of dry grass as it came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three more heart-beats. and it was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath him. He could plainly see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridle hanging from the saddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Daily's eyes were pivoted on the gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrel nestling at the side of the boulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The top of a black head came in line with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glowing steel, and Daily fired again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The horse raised its head curiously, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued grazing. The top of the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">head was withdrawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then the horse thrust out its nose, planted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">its feet, and snorted. It had come to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Daily's horse shot in the trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Daily bunched himself, rose, and leaped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the boulder in front of him. He went to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bogganing down the mountain, starting a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mass of earth and stones. Twice he turned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over to right himself and spit out dirt. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">struck the trail, and went sprawling on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He jumped to his feet half blinded, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seized the horse before it could elude him,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ran a few steps as it shied past the dead</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'horse, then swung to the saddle. The horse</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">leaped forward in a few short, stiff jumps,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then struck into a long, racing stride.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Guns began to sputter and spit from</seg><seg type="columnLine">both sides of the canon.

O. McD., Yates Center, Kansas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Electric currents for railway purposes are gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erated in a machine called a dynamo. The dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mo is very much like a large motor in construction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is driven by a steam engine and gives out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">current of electricity. The current flows out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machinc at the positive or (-)-) end through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machines that are being driven, and back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dynamo, which enters at the negative or (--)</seg><seg type="columnLine">end. The path that the current follows, made up</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dynamo, the trolley-wire, the car wiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">and motor, the track return circuit to the dynamo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is known as the circuit, also any path that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current follows is known as a circuit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For instance, the wiring of a car is known as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car-circuit, and the path that the current takes</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the armature of a motor is known as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">armature-circuit. To describe simply the prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciple on which the action is based, it may be said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a magnet is a piece of iron or steel which</seg><seg type="columnLine">lias the property of attracting other pieces of iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">or steel. The two ends of a magnet are different.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They will both attract iron, but if one end of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single magnet is suspended by a string at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle, the following facts will be noted: If we</seg><seg type="columnLine">call the ends of the first magnet No. 1 and No. 2,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the ends of the second magnet No. 3 and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">No. 4, then, if No. 3 is brought near to No. 2</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will attract each other, but if No. 3 be</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought near No. 1 they will repel each other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also No. 4 will attract No. 1. but will repel No. 2.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This shows that there must be some difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the ends of the magnets or they, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">act alike. This attraction and repulsion between</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnets is the principle on which electric motors</seg><seg type="columnLine">are built. In fact, the electric consists of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stationary magnet or " field," and a movable</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnet, or " armature,"' attached to- a shaft or</seg><seg type="columnLine">axle. The field and armature are so arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they cannot touch each other, though' the</seg><seg type="columnLine">armature can revolve very near the field. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving magnet is drawn to the fixed magnet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and just as it arrives the current is turned off so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it flies past.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as it passes the center of the field, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current is turned on again in the opposite direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, so that they now repel each other. And so</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, as long as the current flows, the movable ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mature is kept revolving. This turns the shaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the shaft turns the car-axle. The main parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a street railway motor are a field-magnet. which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is stationary, and a revolving armature. The field-</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnet is composed of an iron or a steel casting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which has a certain quantity of insulated wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound around it.

When the windings of an armature, car-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rying current, come in front of a pole-piece of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the field-magnet, they are forced away and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">armature is kept revolving as long as the current</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flows.

That the railroad seems to have a closer connection with each of the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">water routes than they have with each other. 5.

All the deep-sea ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sels are not under our control. Our co^t»£^</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing vessels are, to be sure; but a ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying the British flag and running with</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheat from Portland, Oregon, to Liverpool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">England, is practically free of all our laws</seg><seg type="columnLine">in regard to freight-rates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet this ship carries wheat in competi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with our transcontinental railroads,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, therefore, it greatly affects freight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rates between ever}- town from Oregon to</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keeping this fact in mind let us see. by</seg><seg type="columnLine">illustration, how it works out in practise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We will say that the Interstate Commerce</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commission, the shippers all the way from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pacific to the Atlantic seaboards, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroads--hay a dozen of them--have all</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed on certain rates on all goods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">686</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          the early days of the Interstate</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commerce Commission that body</seg><seg type="columnLine">endeavored to confine itself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rates on land alone, but soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">found, as it so well worded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, " water competition is</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Banquo's ghost, it will not stay buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rises at the most awkward times."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through sheer force of circumstance, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">commission was compelled to consider water</seg><seg type="columnLine">competition in connection with every rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road freight-rate in the United States.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What made this a very awkward matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that Congress, in its innocence about</seg><seg type="columnLine">such affairs, practically forbade the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission having anything to do with ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">traffic, directly or indirectly, but ships and</seg><seg type="columnLine">freight-cars have a way of combining in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of Congress or commission, so. in time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both bodies slowly awoke to the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two would have to be considered together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another trouble enters.

All</seg><seg type="columnLine">is peace and everything is working smooth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, when suddenly this same English ship--</seg><seg type="columnLine">multiplied by a hundred more--offers to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry lumber to Europe from Puget Sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">for less than we charge to haul it by rail to</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York or Boston, and then by ship to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we have practically no ships on any</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean given to commerce, the ship charges</seg><seg type="columnLine">from New York or Boston to England or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germany or France are made by foreign</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship owners.

Stan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dish's crime would blow over in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">months; Baker's would be the talk of keen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">witted sleuths spurred on for months and</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, perhaps, by the monstrous reward for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his body--dead or alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No, he couldn't afford to send Standish</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.

Around his eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his mouth were evidences of a better</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeding than usually comes to the average</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlaw. He had something of a kindly ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression, something of genuine sincerity in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face and manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps if he had not been deserted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a God-forsaken, unlucky father--perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he had had a chance to grow up among</seg><seg type="columnLine">good men, and had not been left to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperadoes of a forgotten country for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental guidance--he might have become a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good man with decent prospects.

" It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pretty good patch at that, but it's kind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of choked with weeds. You go over there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pull the weeds out and throw them well</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the hill."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standish sauntered out to the patch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">potatoes, and looked at the weeds with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">critical eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled to think of being brought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">such work; he had never done it before' in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his life.

Even if Standish declined his propo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sition, he would have to be made a prisoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">at night until some disposition could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It now seemed to be well toward the noon</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, and Baker knew that whatever he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">would require the greater part of his time</seg><seg type="columnLine">before darkness fell. Whatever happened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he began to realize that he did not care to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sit up all night by the sleeping form of Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">Standish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baker arose and walked over to one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deserted cabins, about a hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his own. It was one of the best of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the array of rotting hovels of Gull City.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baker had given it second choice when se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lecting his abode. He opened the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked in. That would do pretty well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he remembered that during his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">tour of investigation about the place he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen a rusty anvil in the middle of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the streets. He recalled that when it first</seg><seg type="columnLine">met his gaze he had said it might come in</seg><seg type="columnLine">handy some day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he wandered about until he found it</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. He leaned over to pick it up. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun had turned it too hot for immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">handling, so he dragged it to a shady place</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let it cool. Finally he carried it without</seg><seg type="columnLine">much effort to the cabin which he had se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lected as the " prison " in which Standish</seg><seg type="columnLine">should spend his nights, and set it in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There," he said to himself. "Now, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had a chain that could be run through</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hardy-hole and then fastened to Stan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dish's leg, I would sleep at night--all right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if the hardy miners who tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make Gull City a populous and prosperous</seg><seg type="columnLine">center," thought Baker, " left anvils and</seg><seg type="columnLine">710</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stoves and tin buckets and all the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I have collected to make me comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, they must have left a piece of chain</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standish would soon find out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Returning to the vegetable garden. Baker</seg><seg type="columnLine">called to Standish. The latter, who was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his knees working with a will that sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised even himself, popped to his feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smilingly responded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Standish," said Baker, " I want a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of chain. Look around among these huts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see if you can find about ten feet or</seg><seg type="columnLine">so--and not too heavy, Standish."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standish looked in the direction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dilapidated territory indicated by Baker's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And when you find it, Standish, bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to me.

Baker re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the cabin. There he stood in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway and saw the younger man idly</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicking the dust with his feet, now stooping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now picking up something, now looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about gingerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He roamed thither and yon and then dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared behind one of the cabins. He must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been out of sight for some fifteen min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes. When he again appeared before Ba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ker he had about four feet of rusty wagon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chain and a small dog-chain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baker's eyes gleamed with joy as Stan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dish handed them over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just the things!" exclaimed Baker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where did you find them? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standish was about to give a minute de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail of the success of his quest, but evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baker did not care to hear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He threw the chains to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Standish," he went on, "here is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point of my argument.

The heavier chain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he ran through the hardy-hole of the rusty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">anvil. Bringing the two ends together, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ran the dog-chain through the last link of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">each end. At the one end of the dog-chain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was a ring; this served to form the end of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">loop. Finally the boot was finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The two men had dinner as the sun was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">going down.

Some old bedding was gathered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the other cabins and placed on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">floor. A bucket of water and,a chair were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">placed hard by. All this was overlooked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">until the last moment, and in the fast ap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">proaching darkness it had to be done</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rather hurriedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   When all was ready Standish was ordered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to sit down on the chair.

As the locomotive puffed laboriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the grade past the young man the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer leaned from the window, and, spy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the waiting figure, burst into a jeering</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Having the time of yer life, ain't yer? "</seg><seg type="columnLine">he remarked ironically. "Going far?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blind rage seethed up in Campbell's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. He shook his fist after the vanishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">locomotive as he yelled:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll have the time of my life with you!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll get you yet, do y'ou hear? I'll get you</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another burst of laughter floated back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the engine, now almost hidden by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick trees that lined the track. A cloud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">black smoke slowly ascending the mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">spur, at the top of which the factory' stood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed Campbell the position of the freight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He decided that it would be worse than</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless to apply at the factory for work un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til Wheelock had made his return trip; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big engineer would only hold him up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridicule' and spoil whatever chances he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have. The one thing to do was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek out some convenient spot near enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the track to see the passing of the train,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and await the return of the freight. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, it was some time after midday, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt hungry and tired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eye pained him a good deal, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was bruised and sore as a result of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unequal encounter of the night before. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">started slowly along the, track, keeping a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookout for a likely place to sit down. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees grew thickly along the embankment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in some places the low bushes and run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning vines were so thick that he had to tear</seg><seg type="columnLine">a way through them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were no houses within a mile or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two, and the homes of the factory employ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ees were for the most part on the other side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mountain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reaching the spur track, he observed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large flat rock, half hidden from where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, and wholly concealed from the view</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any one passing on a train a short dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance up the incline. It would make an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellent resting-place, and he decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">utilize it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gully was wide but shallow at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">point. A little farther on and it disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared altogether. Gaging the width of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gully with his eye, Campbell made a spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the other side. As his feet struck, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone moved under him--turned--rolled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made a frantic clutch for the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging bushes, but they slipped from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp, and he fell to the bottom of the em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bankment, one leg doubled cruelly under</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He heard a sharp snap, and a sicken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing pain shot through his right knee, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head struck a sharp stone, and lie knew no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When his senses returned the October sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sinking in a blaze of autumn glory in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cloud-flecked west. For a moment or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two he lay still, trying to remember where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was and how he had come there. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a twinge of pain in his leg brought realiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of his plight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried to move, and fell back, gasping</seg><seg type="columnLine">in agony. Great beads of perspiration</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke out on his brow. From the position</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which he lay there was no doubt of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth--his right leg was broken below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden movement a few yards below</seg><seg type="columnLine">him caught his ear. He opened his lips to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry for help, but with an uncontrollable im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulse closed them again without uttering a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " There!

With a thrill of horror, he realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had removed the spikes holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rails to the ties--that tbey meant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck No. 7, the east-bound flier, due, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they supposed, in half an hour. Since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">track-walker had passed, there was little</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of detection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That the scoundrels were unaware of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">change of schedule of No. 7, which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring her along an hour later than their</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculations, mattered little. There were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other trains due in either direction, and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one passed that way save an occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramp.

Must he lie there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerless and helpless, unable to prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disaster? Shouting would avail him</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. The factory was too far away for</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one to be attracted by his cries, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would serve only to bring down upon him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vengeance of the two wreckers who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just gone, and who would await the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">summation of their plans at no great dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No! if anything were to be done, he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">make his way up nearer the factory until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make some one of the men hear him</seg><seg type="columnLine">Could he do it?

A violent</seg><seg type="columnLine">nausea seized him; his brain whirled. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees beside the track swayed in a mad, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">canny dance. Foot by foot he won his tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured way upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a strange singing in his ears;</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights flashed before his dimming eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For an eternity he dragged himself on in</seg><seg type="columnLine">exquisite agony, then he sank beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">track.

The freight was coming down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spur!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Campbell knew what it meant.

The thought of the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">stilled the delirious laughter on Campbell's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips.

The young man shivered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No! Wheelock mustn't die. He must save</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wheelock for Nellie. She loved him--she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted him. She didn't want a poor devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an oiler, who couldn't hurt a man twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">his size. Well, it didn't matter. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">mattered much, except that he wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest.

Campbell propped himself on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and raised a feeble shout. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sign from the oncoming monster. An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other cry broke from his lips.

There was lit-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tle doubt the man would be there when I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">returned.

From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the birth of the locomotive in this country, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we all know, the reverse has been effected through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reverse-lever working in a notched quadrant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and requiring purely manual effort for its manipu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For many years, at least half a ccntury, during</seg><seg type="columnLine">which period there was practically no development</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the size and weight of the American locomotive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this appliance effectually served the purpose for</seg><seg type="columnLine">which intended. The weight of the various parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">making up the valve-gear, links, eccentric-straps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods, rockers, and valves was light, and no diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culty was experienced in pulling the lever over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When unlatched, even with the locomotive at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highest speed, the engineer was not at all alarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it would get away from him, and, consequent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, it was used, as it was expected that it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, to adjust the cut-off to meet the requirements</seg><seg type="columnLine">of load and grade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In 1S95, or thereabouts, began the revolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">which has taken place in locomotives. Previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that time the heaviest freight-enginc weighed</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely 120,000 pounds, but with the advent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the compound system this weight increased to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">759</seg><seg type="columnLine">760</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">145,000 pounds. Cast steel began to take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place of cast iron for frames, driving-boxes, rock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, and wheel centers, and in a very few years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">say about 1902, a locomotive was not considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthy of special comment regarding size unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">it tipped the scales at 200,000 pounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This advance in general weight implied, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, a proportionate advance in the weight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the component parts. Eccentric-straps, links, etc.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of the valvc-gear which must be lifted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverse-lever, became doubly heavy. No matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">what counterbalancing features were resorted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order that the movement of the lever might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">assisted, it became realized in a vague sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">way that it would no longer fill the bill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineers, especially on heavy locomotives</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the head of high-speed trains, became rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of their old friend. Many of them learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather unpleasantly that it had better be let alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">when once hooked up into the running-notch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Often when they would attempt to make a nicer</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjustment, pull her up or drop her down a notch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lever would have an awkward knack of twist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out of their hands, and whipping down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner with a bang, occasionally to the ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">companiment of a shower of notches pulled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the quadrant, and maybe a broken eccentric-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strap. So, gradually, the situation resolved into</seg><seg type="columnLine">one notch for the lever, and it was let severely</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, thereby defeating the adjustable feature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all valve-gears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the gradual appreciation of this fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive-power management was impelled to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the sea for a solution to the problem. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">they use the screw reverse-gear, in which the links</seg><seg type="columnLine">are raised and lowered by means of a hand wheel</seg><seg type="columnLine">operating a threaded screw connected to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach-rod, and which unquestionably operates</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the minimum of effort at whatever speed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">locomotive may be working. It appears to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, and more apparent every day that this ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rangement must be incorporated in American</seg><seg type="columnLine">practise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Screw-reversing mechanism takes up little room</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cab. It can be wound to full reverse with</seg><seg type="columnLine">three turns of the wheel by one hand whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam is being used or not, and it permits of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very finest adjustment of the gear to meet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">varying conditions which are at all times arising.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is enthusiastically indorsed bv the foreign</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads on which it is used; the engineers are loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their praise. The only possible objection which</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be urged would be slow movements in</seg><seg type="columnLine">switching, but it is not intended to advocate its</seg><seg type="columnLine">use for switch-engines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What is specifically desired is a valve-gear con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolling mechanism which can be operated on</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-speed locomotives without danger to the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gineer; in which he will have sufficient confidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">to attempt to work. As we have said, the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverse-lever largely defeats the purpose of valve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gears, whether shifting-link or radial, because,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it must be said, many engineers fear it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">screw-gear offers an easy solution to this. We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would be glad if some enterprising motive-power</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief w'ould give it a fair trial.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LET THE HEADLIGHT ALONE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE have noticed that the tendency exists on</seg><seg type="columnLine">some roads to transfer the headlight from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its well - known position above the smoke - box</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of the stack to the front of the smoke-</seg><seg type="columnLine">box door. We do not enthuse greatly over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">change. In some cases it is necessary with new</seg><seg type="columnLine">and larger locomotives to preserve the proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead clearance. In the face of such conditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">no objection can be urged, but we have particu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larly in mind instances where headlights are be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing relocated on old engines where an abundance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of clearance always existed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In explanation it is said that lowering the head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light about to the center line of the engine serves</seg><seg type="columnLine">to illuminate the track to better advantage, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it is remembered that the oil-Iamp is prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically valueless to the engineer as an illuminating</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent, the argument does not seem logical. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">it amounts to at the best is to give warning that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engine is approaching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In its old position the headlight is protected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is so high up that it cannot be struck by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">object, and arranged on a board supported by</seg><seg type="columnLine">columns there is a free circulation of air between</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and the hot smoke-box at all times, thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">protecting it from burning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it is now, after relocation, it seems almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">inconceivable how it can be protected either from</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire or damage. The smoke-box door is opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">every trip for netting examination and other well</seg><seg type="columnLine">known routine roundhouse features, and it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">take considerable care to work a wrench on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door button-nuts without doing some harm to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlight. The fact should also be recalled that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all doors are not in perfect condition. Many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them are cracked, and it is no unusual sjght to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">a red-hot door resulting from a fire in the smoke-</seg><seg type="columnLine">box--which, of course, would mean no headlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a very few miles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the whole, we think that this is one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things which had better be let alone. It can have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no other result than a positive increase in ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pense, not to mention a sad blow to the sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">metrical appearance of the locomotive. If an</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric headlight were under consideration, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">comment might not apply, but the oil-light is far</seg><seg type="columnLine">better off in its present position in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">£</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A WORTHY INSTITUTION.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOTICES have been sent out by superintend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ents of the various divisions of the Penn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sylvania Railroad calling attention to the St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">John's Orphanage, No. 1722 Rittenhouse Street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philadelphia.
