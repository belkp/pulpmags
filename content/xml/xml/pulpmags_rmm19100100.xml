rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soned Captain Sleigh, the wheel must</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessarily revolve It was such a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicated arrangement that it took

where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold came from, and that the ingots only</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been of use in building the hut As</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as they had recovered

type="columnLine">new sensation, like a drunkard who</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinks more to offset what he has drunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would seek more treasure, and--</seg><seg type="columnLine">here was what was at the bottom of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philip's mental gravity--when they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cornered all the treasure they would go</seg><seg type="columnLine">a step farther and make the treasure safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would make the secret of it safe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too  and murder is only a short

type="columnLine">--and her--share of the treasure It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like throwing suggestion into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth Perhaps they would chew it over</seg><seg

So</seg><seg type="columnLine">they stood, the frightful reptile with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth wide open, hissing and glaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the eyes of the man who in
