                        <ab>.. give yourself a chance</ab>
                        <ab>A few trained exporters are at present controlling the American total of foreign orders, because they alone know how to export American goods. As a result, they are getting
                            what all trained specialists deserve to get--big money and big jobs.</ab>
                        <ab>The man who knows how to handle an export order is the man thousands of American manufacturers are clamoring for. The day of the trained export man is to-day. It is right
                            here. Now. Right before your eyes, as you read this sen-tence.</ab>
                        <ab>In the unsentimental choosing by big producers of men to increase profit, those with simply domestic experience are being passed by. Big industry is hook-ing up to the man
                            who can help it in putting over its big foreign deals. It de-mands the specialist.</ab>
                        <ab>You always will have to offer something special to step ahead in business. Can you think of anything to offer more timely than a trained ability to handle foreign orders
                            with success?</ab>
                        <ab>Because you will hardly think of any-thing more profitable, give yourself a chance to make good by sending for our booklet, The New Foreign Trade, which tells you how to
                            begin training</ab>

                    <ab>LIST, little maid, with the eager feet And the tender eyes of blue, Laugh while the world seems glad and sweet Sing while you think it true. Gather roses and lilies fair, Dance
                        with the dancing streams, Keep your heart while you can from care, Youth is the time for dreams.</ab>
                    <ab>List, little maid, with the waving hands And the plaited, golden hair, One in the wide world understands All that you do and dare. One is glad for your eager heart And your
                        smile that ever gleams, Yours is of life the golden part, Youth is the time for dreams.</ab>
                    <ab>List, little maid, with the faith sublime, And the trust that angels know, Griefs may lie in the lap of Time And your bounding step grow slow. But one who wearies of stress and
                        strife And of joy not all it seems, Is glad, from the depths of his jaded life, That youth is the time for dreams.</ab>

                        <title>Love Laughs at Locksmiths, But--</title>
                    </ab>
                    <ab>ONCE upon a time, before the High Cost of Living raised its hydra-headed menace in the land, there lived a youth and a maiden named respectively Jack and Jill. In the Theatre
                        of Life, they listened to the clever patter of the little vaude- villain billed as Love, and fell for his stuff. So they were married, and all was as merry as the wedding bells
                        until one day Poverty came in at the door. The door was locked, but that made no difference to Poverty. He came in just the same. By way of a joke, Love jumped through the
                        window. Poverty took possession of the spare room and proceeded to make himself at home.</ab>
                    <ab>Jack and Jill 'phoned for the Locksmith to come and repair the damage. The Locksmith came with his kit of tools, but, catching a glimpse of Poverty in the spare room, demanded
                        his pay in advance. Whereupon Love stuck his head in the window and burst into roars of laughter.</ab>
                    <ab>"Ha! ha! ha! Ho! ho! ho!" cried Love. "If there's anybody that can get a laugh out of me, it's a Locksmith. He's funnier than I am."</ab>
                    <ab>Jack and Jill were overjoyed to see the Locksmith slink away, nor did they know he had merely gone to fetch his gang. But that is just what the miserable gangster did.
                        Presently he returned, reinforced by the Butcher, the Baker and the Candle- stick Maker, all armed with cruel weapons known as Bills. Using these horrible instruments of
                        torture to extract their nefarious toll from Jack and Jill, they beat Love to an unrecognizable pulp while Poverty stood outside to stall off any possible police interference,
                        thus making the world safe for Democracy. Then they all went away to report to their master, the High Cost of Living, making the well-known welkin ring with the peals of
                        raucous mirth.</ab>
                    <ab>MORAL</ab>
                    <ab>Love laughs at locksmiths, but--He laughs best who laughs last. THE lure of the unattainable is what makes life worth while. After a man's search is rewarded by finding the
                        ideal woman, she passes him up because she is looking for the ideal man.</ab>
                    <ab>THERE is nothing so beautiful as sympathy. A woman always feels sorry for a man who has trouble with his wife, unless she happens to be his wife.</ab>

                    <ab>AN ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If there were no marriages, there would be no divorces.</ab>
                    <ab>Sweet are the uses of adversity, but adversity, like olives, may be an acquired taste.</ab>
                    <ab>Happiness comes from mating with our opposites; but did you ever hear of a beardless youth marrying a girl with a hare lip?</ab>
                    <ab>All the world's a stage, but don't try to be the whole show.</ab>
                    <ab>Consistency is a jewel, with which beauty is content to be unadorned.</ab>
                    <ab>Men are but children of a larger growth. When our parents cease spanking us, experience begins.</ab>
                    <ab>A soft answer turneth away wrath, but that is no reason why you shouldn't take boxing lessons.</ab>
                    <ab>Virtue is its own reward, and most of us go through life unrewarded. Love is blind. It causes two people to think almost as much of each other as they do of themselves.</ab>
                    <ab>There is nothing new under the sun. Even our mistakes have been made before.</ab>
                    <ab>It is possible to reach a man's heart through his stomach; but that sort of man would rather lost his heart than his appetite.</ab>

                    <ab>BEING a coward myself, I am an ardent hero worshiper. The golden chevrons on a soldier's sleeve intoxicate me with adulation. An aviator thrills me with bliss. A man who can
                        nonchalantly go to a dentist commands my admiration. Even a married man inspires my respect.</ab>
                    <ab>Consequently, when the circus manager volunteered to conduct me through his realms of romance and mystery, my love of heroic deeds prompted me to accept. First he pointed out
                        his celebrities.</ab>
                    <ab>"There is Signor Scario, my lion tamer," he announced.</ab>
                    <ab>I regret to say that Signor Scario scarcely looked the part. He seemed decidedly anemic. "Still, you never can tell," I mused. "He must be possessed of great courage."</ab>
                    <ab>"To-night he has decided to sleep in the cage with his lions," said my host.</ab>
                    <ab>"Ah! What a brave man," I exclaimed.</ab>
                    <ab>"Oh, I don't know," replied the circus manager. "He has had a scrap with his wife and he's afraid to go home."</ab>

                    <ab>TO-DAY the golden sun sank in the west, And as I watched its mellow afterglow, And saw the changing colors come and go, By vagrant cloudlets kissed and e'en caressed, Unbidden
                        tears came to my eyes distressed, And caused my memory to overflow With ever present dreams, and in my woe I cursed the sun in very wretchedness.</ab>
                    <ab>For in the west, the world seemed turned to red, And then a smear of yellow overcast The sky; and as the color quickly spread, Brought visions of my early morn's repast; And
                        all the scene recalled, as from the dead, The weary egg with which I broke my fast.</ab>

                    <ab>Barbara Le Moyne, after seeing Christopher Keene fight for his life against five Malays on the Pacific coast, rides away for help but finds, on her return, that he has
                        disappeared. Later, in San Francisco, Barbara is courted by Longfield, who introduces Keene to her. Long- field, who has all but won Barbara's consent to marry him, has
                        deliberately courted Keene's friendship. There is something mysterious about Longfield, and Keene's suspicions are aroused. Keene is in San Francisco in search of a clue to the
                        scene of his fight with the Malays. The wounds he received in that encounter have wiped from his mind all memory of the location of the spot at which he had buried a treasure,
                        brought, through great dangers, from Asia to America. Barbara unwittingly gives him the name of the bay.</ab>

                <div type="ltext">
                    <ab>THERE was once a man who lived in a valley--a pretty valley, but there was no creek in it, and the man was lonely for the sound of running water. Then the man said:</ab>
                    <ab>"I shall go up to the top of the hill and dig a well and draw water therefrom and pour it onto the hillside so it will run down and form a creek in my valley."</ab>
                    <ab>And he did so.</ab>
                    <ab>Very soon a little stream went leaping and shouting down the hill, and clapped its hands at sight of the pretty valley and crooned, softly, to itself.</ab>
                    <ab>The man saw and heard and was greatly pleased. Then he said: "Now, I shall go down into my valley and enjoy the rivulet I have made."</ab>
                    <ab>And he went down. When he had descended and stood in the valley the stream had disappeared.</ab>
                    <ab>He forgot, you see, that the stream was of his making, and could last only while he drew water from the well and poured it out onto the hillside.</ab>
                    <ab>You say he was a very foolish man.</ab>
                    <ab>No doubt. Still, you must know many very foolish men who conduct their business with no more wisdom than the man in the valley showed in making a creek.</ab>
                    <ab>Don't you know men who started their business with a rush, gained a certain speed, and then sat back to hear things hum?</ab>
                    <ab>Generally they fall asleep and awaken to find there is no stream flowing through the valley.</ab>
                    <ab>The editors of Live Stories know nothing of any business, except the making of a magazine.</ab>
                    <ab>Maybe, they don't know much about that.</ab>
                    <ab>One thing, however, they know:</ab>
                    <ab>If the stream is to go on running delightfully through the valley, the water must, forever and ceaselessly, be drawn from the well and poured out on the hillside.</ab>
                    <ab>This, at least, the editors of Live Stories know. It is to this they are bending every effort and giving constant attention.</ab>
                    <ab>They are not satisfied. They will never be satisfied.</ab>
                    <ab>The last word is so difficult to reach! The last word? Silently, steadily, it removes itself farther and farther as the weary pursuit goes on.</ab>
                    <ab>But you, they want to please. They want, at least, with each issue, to come nearer to pleasing you.</ab>
                    <ab>In this task, they need your aid.</ab>
                    <ab>You must tell them the whys and the wherefores.</ab>
                    <ab>Will you?</ab>
                    <ab>Just a word about what you like or don't like and why? Remember, out of the deep well of your understanding, the editors draw their inspiration. Let's keep that little stream
                        going down into the valley of your mutual delight.</ab>

                    <ab>Why Run-down Pale Exhausted WOMEN Should Take Iron "There can be no beautiful, healthy, rosy-cheeked, steady nerved women without iron. When the iron goes from the blood of
                        women, the roses go from their cheeks--their charm and attract- iveness depart. I always insist that my patients take organic iron-- Nuxated Iron--(not metallic iron which
