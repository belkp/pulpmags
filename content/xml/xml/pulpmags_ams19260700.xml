                        <ab>ADVERTISING brings to millions, at reasonable prices, comforts and conveniences which with- out advertising would be luxuries that only a few could enjoy.</ab>
                        <ab>America is an advertising nation. That is one reason why the man with moderate means here enjoys more comforts than most wealthy men abroad.</ab>
                        <ab>Because thousands on thousands of people ask for a certain article by the same name, which they have read in the same advertise- ments, it is possible for the advertiser to
                            sell this item at a minimum of effort.</ab>
                        <ab>It is therefore possible to manufacture and to distribute this product at a saving which you share with the advertiser.</ab>
                        <ab>When you figure the number of these items in your daily life built by advertising, you can appreciate that advertising does pay you!</ab>
                        <ab>Advertisements enable you to buy better things at less cost</ab>

                        <ab>STUART'S PLAPAO-PADS are entirely different--being applicators mado self-adhe- sive purposely to keep the muscle restorative called "Plapao" constantly in contact with the
                            affected muscles. No straps, buckles or obnoxious springs attached. When adhering closely to the body all grinding pressure is obviated; furthermore, slipping is
                            impossible, so cannot chafe or press against the bone. Soft as velvet--easy to apply--inexpensive. In use by thousands for twenty years--most obsti- nate ruptures reported
                            conquered in privacy of the home without hindrance from work. Awarded Gold Medal, Rome; Grand Prix, Paris; and honorable mention Panama Expo- sition, San Francisco. Process
                            of recovery is natural, so afterwards no further use for trusses. Stop wasting time and money on old-fashioned trusses; close the hernial open- ing as Nature intended, so
                            the rupture can't come down. It will cost nothing to test the PLAPAO--send no money, just the coupon with your address today.</ab>
