            <seg type="columnLine">of vines crowded up the steps with a rush,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and advancing tendrils whipped through</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the doorway. Haverland flung the door</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to with a re-echoing crash. A few short</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lengths of the vine were caught in the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">gave him the advantage of weight and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">in this room the halo appeared once more,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">just as Haverland had seen it over the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and filled the room with a glory of soft</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">light. By this illumination the engineer</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">saw that it was really a denuded length of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">vine, now more like a hideous, tapering</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">worm; saw, too, that there was scarcely a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">leaf remaining on the tangle of vines at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the window. In the glory of the halo</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">these boneless arms serpentined in a ter-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was the sound of earthquake; the hill</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shook, and metal clanged in the central</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Through the broad windows of this</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">central chamber one commanded a view</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the entire countryside. The hill itself</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the foliaged heads of the oaks and cotton-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">woods. Haverland, looking down at the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">trees, saw the entire woods bathed in cold</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">flame. The grove was one vast phos-</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">phorescence. The tree-trunks glowed,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and the masses of leaves shone like soft,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">burnished metal. All the great vines</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were alive with light, and hung from the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">trees in waterfalls of flame. It was a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thing seen in a nightmare or read in a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fairy-tale. Another Birnam Wood, that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was coming by degrees, but surely,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">toward the central point that was the lab-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">oratories. The laboratory hill seemed to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rise from a chasm whose wralis were solid</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">light. Trees and vines in motion. Be-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fore their advancing trunks and stems the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">earth was rolling away in waves. Then,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dark off in one end of the chamber, the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">engineer saw that the oak on the hill had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">already entered the building. The end</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">generator had been shouldered aside and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">crashed through the floor into the base-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ment. Commotion was in the air. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">storm entered the chamber with the oak,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and rain beat on Haverland's face.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> And still it was not too late. The en-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gineer whirled and retreated through his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">own laboratories, leaping the handful of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">twining creepers in his way. In the back</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the building he picked up a sledge-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">smother of rain to the garage, in which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stood three full drums of gasoline. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ran up the incline on which the drums</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rested, and worked rapidly with a wrench.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He stepped back a little, swung the sledge</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in one heavy blow. The drums, released,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tumbled booming down the runway,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spilling their contents as they went, and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Haverland waited, dripping with rain</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Above low thunders he heard three suc-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">to the spot, but by the time the crowd had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gathered, the breeze had freshened, and it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was impossible to see with any distinct-</seg>
