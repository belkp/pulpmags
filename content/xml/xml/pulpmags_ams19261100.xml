Although, in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion, Amazing Stories is one of the most interest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fiction magazines published, some of the stories have</seg><seg type="columnLine">such obvious scientific mistakes in them, that they seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">more like fairy tales than scientifiction, and conse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently appear to be out of place in your magazine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   For example, even admitting the possibility of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "fourth dimension'' as set forth in Murray Leinster's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Runaway Skyscraper," a little reasoning would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> prove that any timepiece contained in the building at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the time of slipping into the fourth dimension would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> not run backwards, but instead would continue for-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ward, as did all other machinery; also, several other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> authors, in transporting their characters from one planet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to another, have never considered the difference of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> bacterial life upon these worlds, which would speedily</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> cause the death of any visitors who arrived on a new</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> planet without first having acquired immunity from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ravages of its organisms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   As an example of an excusable error, I might cite the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> one in "High Tension," by Albert B.

This is a wholesome sign, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can only say that such correspondence is most welcome.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the magazine is enlarged, which will be very soon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there will be a special department wherein letters of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature will be printed and discussed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Regarding the statement contained in the above letter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">permit us to say that a writer of scientifiction is privileged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use poetic license, the same as is the writer of any other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiction story. There is rarely a story of this type so perfect</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as to pass muster with all of its facts, the general theme,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and many other points.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For example, even in the best-written fiction stories you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will notice the characters converse in rather extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">language. This is the so-callcd fiction language and is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not generally used in real life. Open almost any first-class</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine and, if you stop to think for a second, you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize that human beings do not use the flowery language</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the characters do in fiction. The same is true of scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tjfiction in another respect, where authors often take poetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">license, sometimes disregarding true scientific facts, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">still retaining enough scientific accuracy to make the plot</seg><seg type="columnLine">or story seem probable and at the same time interesting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Referring to Murray Leinster's "The Runaway Sky-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraper" our correspondent is probably correct as to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">timepieces. But why pick on the timepieces? If we grant</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fourth dimension, we will have to grant the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">--to us--queer things supposed to exist on this higher plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if we do not grant any, then wc had better not read the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story at all. Because of the assumption that a century</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time can run backwards, the author naturally must make</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything run backwards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As to the criticism of bacterial life on other worlds, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe it was H. G. Wells, who first pointed out this danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">in transporting living creatures from one world or planet to</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, but at best this only is a theory. There is nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">known about bacterial life in other worlds, but it is certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if explorers ever will travel from one planet to another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this will be taken into consideration, and they will be in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noculatcd, just as travelers now arc innoculatcd when travel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from northern to tropical zones, and vice versa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But why stop at the bacterial danger? There may be far</seg><seg type="columnLine">more deadly things experienced in travelling from one planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another than we know of today. Professor Millikan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">researches recently showed, for example, that his Cosmic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ray, wljich seems to abound in extra-terrestrial space, is far</seg><seg type="columnLine">more deadly than anything we know of. He has found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cosmic Ray can pierce solid lead six feet in thickness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereas the ordinary X-ray, which is itself deadly enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is stopped by a thin sheet of lead. The harm which these</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays might do to an interplanetarian traveler, we arc loath</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think of. What they might be, for instance, on the moon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes one shudder, because the moon having no atmosphere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">any poor human being would probably be killed immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he had not some sort of protection, which today has as</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet not been invented or even thought of.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                                            We disagree with our correspondent as to the strength of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                                            the ligaments in "High Tension."

The walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">were lined with book shelves, and adorned along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper portions with the most extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">photographs and drawings. Even the ceiling was</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with charts, some representing the sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while many others were</seg><seg type="columnLine">geological and topogra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phical pictures of the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beside the drawing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board lay a pad of paper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and occasionally the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">man nervously turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, and, grasping a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">pencil, made elaborate cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culations, covering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper with a sprinkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mathematical symbols</seg><seg type="columnLine">that looked like magnified</seg><seg type="columnLine">animalcules.

One would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that he was laboring to save his very soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had but a few seconds of respite left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently he threw down the pencil, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishing agility let himself rapidly, but care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, off the stool on which he had been sitting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping the palms of his hands on the seat beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hips until he felt his feet touch the floor. Then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he darted at a book-shelf, pulled down a ponderous</seg><seg type="columnLine">tome, flapped it open in a clear space on the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dropped on his knees to consult it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After turning a leaf or two he found what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was after, read down the page, keeping a finger on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lines, and, having finished his reading, jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet and hurried back to the stool, on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he mounted so quickly that it was impossible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see how he managed it without an upset. Instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he made a new diagram, and then fell to figuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">furiously on the pad, making his pencil gyrate so</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast that its upper end vibrated like the wing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dragon-fly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last he threw down the pencil, and, encircling</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knees with his clasped arms, sank in a heap</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the stool.

Nobody else would have noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and I wouldn't if I had not been looking for it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's knowledge that clarifies the eyes and breeds</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge, Joseph Smith. It was not truly visible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet I could see that it was there. I tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make out the shape of the thing--but it was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">indefinite. But I know very well what it is. See</seg><seg type="columnLine">here"--he suddenly broke off--"Look at the photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graph." (He was pointing at the Lord Rosse</seg><seg type="columnLine">nebula on the wall). "It's like that, only it's com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing edgewise toward us. We may miss some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer spirals, but we're going to smash into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With fallen jaw, and black brows contracted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joseph Smith stared at the photograph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It doesn't shine like that," he said at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little man snorted contemptuously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What have I told you about its invisibility?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how, then, do you know that it is of a watery</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo Vers&amp;l threw up his hands and waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in an agony of impatience. He climbed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stool to get nearer the level of the other's eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fixing him with his gaze, exclaimed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know very well how I know it. I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">it because I have demonstrated with my new spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">troscope, which analyses extra-visual rays, that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">those dark nebulae that were photographed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">milky way years ago are composed of watery vapor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are far off, on the limits of the universe. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">one is one right at hand. It's a little one compared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them--but it's enough, yes, it's enough! You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that more than two years ago I began to cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">respond with astronomers all over the world about</seg><seg type="columnLine">this thing, and not one of them would listen to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, they'll listen when it's too late perhaps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They'll listen when the flood-gates are opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the inundation begins. It's not the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this thing has happened. I haven't a doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the flood of Noah, that everybody pretends to</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh at now, was caused by the earth passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a watery nebula. But this will be worse</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that; there weren't two thousand million peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple to be drowned then as there are now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For five minutes neither spoke. Cosmo Versal</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung on the stool, and played with an ellipsograph;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joseph Smith dropped his chin on his breast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervously fingered the pockets of his long vest. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">last he raised his head and asked, in a low voice:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What are'you going to do, Cosmo?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to get ready," was the short reply,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Build an ark."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But will you give no warning to others?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll do my best.

I'll counsel everybody to drop every other</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupation and begin to build arks--but nobody will</seg><seg type="columnLine">heed me. You'll see. My ark will be the only one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I'll save as many in it as I can. And I depend</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon you, Joseph, to help me.

"Anyhow, I must make a few of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best of them hear me. The fate of a whole race</seg><seg type="columnLine">is at stake. If we can save a handful of the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood and brain of mankind, the world will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new chance, and perhaps a better and higher race</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be the result. Since I can't save them all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll pick and choose. I'll have the flower of human-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity in my ark.

As he dropped his head on one side, it looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">too heavy for the stemlike neck, but it conveyed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression of immense intellectual power. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">imposing contour lent force to his words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The flower of humanity," he continued after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight pause. "Who composes it? I must decide</seg><seg type="columnLine">that question. Is it the billionaires? Is it the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kings and rulers? Is it the men of science? Is it</seg><seg type="columnLine">the society leaders? Bah! I'll have to think on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that.

Joseph Smith suddenly asked, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrupting Cosmo's train of thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not at all," was the reply. "They're not suited</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the kind of navigation that will be demanded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They're not buoyant enough, nor manageable</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, and they haven't enough carrying capacity</seg><seg type="columnLine">for power and provisions. They'll be swamped at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wharves, or if they should get away they'd be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent to the bottom inside a few hours. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but specially constructed arks will serve. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's more trouble for me--I must devise a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of vessel. Heavens, how short the time is!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why couldn't I have found this out ten years ago?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's only to-day that I have myself learned the full</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth, though I have worked on it so long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How many will you be able to carry in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">ark?" asked Smith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't tell yet. That's another question to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully considered. I shall build the vessel of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">new metal, levium, half as heavy as aluminum and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice as strong as steel. I ought to find room with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the slightest difficulty for a round thousand in</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surely many more than that!" exclaimed Joseph</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith. "Why, there are ocean-liners that carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">several times as many."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You forget," replied Cosmo Versal, "that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have provisions enough to last for a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, because we cannot count on the immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">reemergence of any land, even the most mountain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous, and the most compressed food takes space when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great quantity is needed. It won't do to over-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd the vessel, and invite sickness. Then too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must take many animals along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Animals," returned Smith. "I hadn't thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. But is it necessary?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Absolutely. Would you have less foresight than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Noah?

Any agricultural chemist would tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. They play an indispensable part in the vital</seg><seg type="columnLine">cycle of the soil. I must also take certain species</seg><seg type="columnLine">of insects and birds. I'll telephone Professor Herge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">schmitberger at Berlin to learn precisely what are</seg><seg type="columnLine">the capitally important species of the animal king-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And when will you begin the construction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ark?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Instantly.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">never married, was never seen in society, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">very few intimates--but he was known by sight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or reputation, to everybody.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning papers had columns of description and</seg><seg type="columnLine">comment, and some of them seemed disposed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">treat the prophet and his prediction with a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">degree of seriousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The servants who had been interviewed overnight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not talk very convincingly, and made the mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take of flinging contempt on both Cosmo and "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gullible public."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Naturally, the public wouldn't stand for that, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pendulum of opinion began to swing the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Cosmo helped his cause by sending to every</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspaper a carefully prepared statement of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">observations and calculations, in which he spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">with such force of conviction that few could read</seg><seg type="columnLine">his words without feeling a thrill of apprehensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertainty. This was strengthened by published</seg><seg type="columnLine">despatches which showed that he had forwarded his</seg><seg type="columnLine">warnings to all the well-known scientific bodies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world, which, while decrying them, made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">effective response.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And there was a note of positive alarm in ai</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubled-leaded bulletin from the new observatory at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mount McKinley, which affirmed that during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">preceding night a singular obscurity had been sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected in the northern sky, seeming to veil many</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stars below the twelfth magnitude. It was added</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the phenomenon was unprecedented, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the observation was both difficult and uncertain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nowhere was the atmosphere of doubt and my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stery, which now began to hang over the public, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable as in Wall Street. The sensitive cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rents there responded like electric waves to the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence, and, to the dismay of hard-headed ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servers, the market dropped as if it had been hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sledge-hammer.

Nobody could</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace the exact origin of the movement, but selling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders came tumbling in until there was a veritable</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic.	. /</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Leningrad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed dispatches announcing that the same unrea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonable slump had manifested itself there, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">united in holding Cosmo Versal solely responsible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foolish break in prices. Leaders of finance rush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to the exchanges trying by arguments and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">postulations to arrest the downfall, but in vain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the afternoon, however, reason partially re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed its sway; then a quick recovery was felt, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many who had rushed to sell all they had, found</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause to regret their precipitancy. The next day all</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on the mend, as far as the stock market was</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned, but among the people at large the poison</seg><seg type="columnLine">of awakened credulity continued to spread, nourish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed by fresh announcements from the fountain head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Cosmo issued another statement to the effect that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had perfected plans for an ark of safety, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would begin at once to construct in the neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">borhood of New York, and he not only offered freely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give his plans to any who wished to commence</seg><seg type="columnLine">construction on their owii account, but he urged</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, in the name of Heaven, to lose no time. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced a prodigious effect, and multitudes began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be infected with a nameless fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile an extraordinary scene occurred, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind closed doors, at the headquarters of the Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">negie Institution in Washington. Joseph Smith,</seg><seg type="columnLine">actng under Cosmo Versal's direction, had for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warded an elaborate precis of the latter's argu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, accompanied with full mathematical details,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the head of the institution. The character of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">document was such that it could not be ignored.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, the savants composing the council of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most important scientific association in the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">were aware of the state of the public mind, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that it was incumbent upon them to do some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to allay the alarm. Of late years a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">supervisory control over scientific news of all kinds</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been accorded to them, and they appreciated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that a duty now rested upon their shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Accordingly, a special meeting was called to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sider the communication from Cosmo Versal. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the general belief that a little critical examin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation would result in complete proof of the fallacy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all his work, proof which could be put in a form</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the most uninstructed would understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the papers, diagrams, and mathematical</seg><seg type="columnLine">formulas had no sooner been spread upon the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the knowing eyes of the learned members of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•	the council, than a chill of conscious impuissance</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran through them. They saw that Cosmo's mathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">682</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">zcatics were unimpeachable. His formulae were ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curately deduced, and his operations absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">correct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They could do nothing but attack his fundamental</seg><seg type="columnLine">data, based on the alleged revelations of his -new</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of spectroscope, and on telescopic observations</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were described in so much detail that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only way to combat them was by the general asser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that they were illusory. This was felt to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very unsatisfactory method of procedure, as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the public was concerned, because it amounted to no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than attacking the credibility of a witness who</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretended to describe only what he himself had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">■--and there is nothing so hard as to prove a nega-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, Cosmo had on his side the whole force of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that curious tendency of the human mind which</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitually gravitates toward whatever is extraor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary, revolutionary, and mysterious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a yet greater difficulty arose. Mention has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been made of the strange bulletin from the Mount</seg><seg type="columnLine">McKinley observatory. -That had been incau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiously sent out to the public by a thoughtless ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">server, who was more intent upon describing a sin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gular phenomenon than upon considering its possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect on the popular imagination. He had imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately received an expostulatory despatch from</seg><seg type="columnLine">headquarters which henceforth shut his mouth--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had told the simple truth, and how embarrassing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was became evident when, on the very table</seg><seg type="columnLine">around which the savants were now assembled, three</seg><seg type="columnLine">despatches were laid in quick succession from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great observatories of Mount Hekla in Iceland, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">North Cape, and Kamchatka, all corroborating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement of the Mount McKinley observer, that an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexplicable veiling of faint stars had manifested</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself in the boreal quarter of the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the president read the despatches--which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the senders had taken the precaution to mai'k "confi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dential"--the members of the council looked at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">another with no little dismay. Here was the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">unprejudiced corroboration of Cosmo Versal's as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sertion that the great nebula was already within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">range of observation. How could they dispute such</seg><seg type="columnLine">testimony, and what were they to make of it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two or three of the members began to be shaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their convictions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Upon my word," exclaimed Professor Alexander</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones, "but this is very curious! And suppose the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow should be right, after all?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right!" cried the president, Professor Pludder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disdainfully. "Who ever heard of a watery nebula?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thing's absurd!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't see that it's absurd," replied Prof. Jones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's plenty of proof of the existence of hy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drogen in some of the nebulae."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So there is," chimed in Prof. Abel Able, "and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's hydrogen, there may be oxygen, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have all that's necessary. It's not the idea that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nebula may consist of watery vapor that's absurd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it is that a watery nebula, large enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drown the earth by condensation upon it could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached so near as this one must now be without</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner betraying its presence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How so?" demanded a voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By its attraction. Cosmo Vers&amp;l says it is al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready less than three hundred million miles away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">If it is massive enough to drown the earth, it ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">long ago to have been discovered by its disturbance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planetary orbits."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not at all," exclaimed Professor Jeremiah Moses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you stick to that argument you'll be drowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure. Just look at these facts. The earth weighs</seg><seg type="columnLine">six and a half sextillions of tons, and the ocean one</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a half quintillions. The average depth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oceans is two' and one-fifth miles. Now--if the level</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ocean were raised only about 1,600 feet, prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically all the inhabited parts of the world would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooded. To cause that increase in the level of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oceans only about one-eighth part would have to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">added to their total mass, or, say, one-seventh part,</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowing for the greater surface to be covered. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be one thirty-thousandth of the weight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe, and if you suppose that only one-hundredth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the entire nebula were condensed on the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole mass of the nebula would not need to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceed one three-hundredth of the weight of the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a quarter that of the moon--and nobody here will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be bold enough to say that the approach of a mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">no greater than that would be likely to be discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered through its attraction when it was three hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred million miles away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several of the astronomers present shook their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads at this, and Professor Pludder irritably de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared that it was absurd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The attraction would be noticeable when it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand millions of miles away," he continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, 'noticeable' I admit," replied Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moses, "but all the same you wouldn't notice it, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause you wouldn't be looking for it unless the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nebula were visible first, and even then it would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quire months of observation to detect the effects.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And how are you going to get around, those bulle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tins ?

All seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnified by the thin white garments which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore on account of the oppressive heat. Many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them had come in haste from various summer re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorts, and were plainly annoyed by the necessity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">attending at the President's command.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo Vers&amp;l was the only cool man there, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his diminutive form presented a striking contrast</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the others. But he looked as if he carried more</seg><seg type="columnLine">brains than all of them put together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was not in the least overawed by the hostile</seg><seg type="columnLine">glances of the statesmen. On the contrary, his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceptibly curled, in a half-disdainful smile, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the big hand which the President extended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. As soon as Cosmo Versal had sunk into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">embrace of a large easy chair, the President opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subject.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have directed you to come," he said in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">majestic tone, "in order the sooner to dispel the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects of your unjustifiable predictions and extra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary proceedings on the public mind--and, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">may add, on public affairs. Are you aware that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have interfered with the measures of this govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment for the defense of the country? You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped in front of the government, and delayed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning of four battle-ships which Congress has</seg><seg type="columnLine">authorized in urgent haste on account of the threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening aspect of affairs in the East? I need hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">say to you that we shall, if necessary, find means</seg><seg type="columnLine">to set aside the private agreements under which</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are proceeding, as inimical to public interests,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but you have already struck a serious blow at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">security of your country."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The President pronounced the last sentence with</seg><seg type="columnLine">oratorical unction, and Cosmo was conscious of an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">approving movement of big official shoulders around</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.

Do you know the position in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which you have placed yourself?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo Versal got upon his feet and advanced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the room like a little David. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye was fixed upon him. His voice was steady, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">intense with suppressed nervousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. President," he said, "you have accused me</seg><seg type="columnLine">of obstructing the measures of the government for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the defense of the country. Sir, I am trying to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole human race from a danger in comparison</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which that of war is infinitesimal--a danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is rushing down upon us with appalling</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, and which will strike every land on the globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">simultaneously. Within seven months not a war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship or any other existing vessel will remain afloat."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The listeners smiled, and nodded significantly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another, but the speaker only grew more</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You think I am insane," he said, "but the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">is you are hoodwinked by official stupidity. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">man," pointing to Professor Pludder, "who knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">me well, and who has had all my proofs laid before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, is either too thick-headed to understand a</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstration or too pig-headed to confess his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">error."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, come," interrupted the President sternly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Professor Pludder flushed very red, "this will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not do!

I know what occurred at the recent meet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of that council, and I know that the ridiculous</seg><seg type="columnLine">announcement put forth in its name to deceive the</seg><seg type="columnLine">public was whipped into shape by him, and does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">express the real opinion of many of the members."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Pludder's face grew redder than ever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Name one!" he thundered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah," said Cosmo sneeringly, "that hits hard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't it?

Great Heavens, the world is on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point of being drowned, and yet the pride of</seg><seg type="columnLine">officialism is so strong in this plodder--Pludder--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and others of his ilk that they'd sooner take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of letting the human race be destroyed than</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognize the truth!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo Versal spoke with such tremendous concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tration of mental energy, and with such evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">sincerity of conviction, and he had so plainly put</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Pludder to rout, that the President, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than.the other listening statesmen, was thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a quandary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a creaking of heavily burdened chairs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ponderous stir all round the circle, while a look</seg><seg type="columnLine">of perplexity became visible on every face. Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Pludder's conduct helped to produce the</seg><seg type="columnLine">change of moral atmosphere. He had been so com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely surprised by Cosmo's accusation, based on</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts which he had supposed were known only to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself and the council, that he was unable for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute to speak at all, and before he could align his</seg><seg type="columnLine">faculties his triumphant little opponent renewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attack. -</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. President," he said, laying his hand on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm of Mr. Samson's big chair, which was nearly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a level with his breast, and speaking with persua-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive earnestness, "you are the executive head of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty nation--the nation that sets the pace for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. It is in your power to do a vast, an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculable, service to 'humanity. One official word</seg><seg type="columnLine">from you would save millions upon millions of lives.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I implore you, instead .of interfering with my work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give instant order for the construction of as</seg><seg type="columnLine">many arks, based upon the plans I have perfected,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the navy yard can possibly turn out. Issue a</seg><seg type="columnLine">proclamation to the people, warning them that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is their only chance of escape."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By a curious operation of the human mind, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech cost Cosmo nearly all the advantage that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had previously gained. His ominous suggestion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great nebula rushing out of the heavens to over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelm the earth had immensely impressed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination of his hearers, and his uncontradicted</seg><seg type="columnLine">accusation that Professor Pludder was concealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the facts had almost convinced them that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. But when he mentioned "arks," the strain</seg><seg type="columnLine">was relieved, and a smile broke out on the broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the President. He shook his head, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to speak, when Cosmo, perceiving that he-had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost ground, changed his tactics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Still you are incredulous!" he exclaimed. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proof is before you! Look at the blazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens! The annals of meteorology do not record</seg><seg type="columnLine">another such summer as this. The vanguard of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatal nebula is already upon us. The signs of dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aster are in the sky. But, note what I say--this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is only the first sign. There is another following</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its heels which may be -here at any moment. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat will succeed cold, and as we rush through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenuous outer spirals the earth will alternately be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped with tempests of snow and sleet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorched by fierce outbursts of solar fire. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">three weeks the sun has been feeding its furnaces</seg><seg type="columnLine">with invisible vapor--but look out, I warn you, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the change that is impending!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These extraordinary words, pronounced with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild air of a prophet, completed the growing convic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the listeners that they really had a madman</seg><seg type="columnLine">to deal with, and Professor Pludder, having re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered his self-command, rose to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. President," he began, "the evidence which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have just seen of an unbalanced mind--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got no further. A pall of darkness suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped upon the room. An inky curtain seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have fallen from the sky. At the same time the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows were shaken by tremendous blasts of wind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, as the electric lights were hastily turned on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge snowflakes, intermingled with rattling hail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones, were seen careering outside. In a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds several large panes of glass were broken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the chilling wind, sweeping round the apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, made the teeth of the -thinly clad statesmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">chatter, while the noise of the storm became deaf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening. The sky lighted, but at the same moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreadful thunder-peals shook the building. Two or</seg><seg type="columnLine">three trees in the White House grounds were struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the bolts, and their broken branches were driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air and carried high above the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the whirling winds, and one of them was thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the building with such force that for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment it seemed as if the'wall had been shattered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the first stunning effect of *this outbreak</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the elements had passed, everybody rushed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows to look out-- everybody except Cosmo</seg><seg type="columnLine">Versal, who remained standing in the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told you!" he said; but nobody listened to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What they saw outside absorbed every faculty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The noise was so stunning that they could not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We have said that -the air lightened after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage of the first pall of darkness, but it w'as not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reappearance of the sun that caused the bright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening. It was an awful light, which seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">born out of the air itself. It had a menacing, cop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pery hue, continually changing 'in character. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole 'upper atmosphere was choked with dense</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds, which swirled and -tumbled, and twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves into great vortical rolls, .spinning like</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic mill-shafts. Once, one of these vortexes</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot downward, with projectile speed, rapidly as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suming the terrible form of the trombe of a tornado,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and where it struck -the ground it tore everything to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces--trees, houses, the very earth itself, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground to powder and then whirled aloft by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistless suction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Occasionally the darkness returned for a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, as if a cover had been clapped upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky, and then, again, the murk would roll off, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reddish gleam would reappear.

Rivers had careered over</seg><seg type="columnLine">their banks, low-lying towns were flooded, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swollen sewers of cities exploded and inundated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets, and gradually news came in from country</seg><seg type="columnLine">districts showing that vast areas of land had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">submerged, and hundreds drowned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The downfall of rain far exceeded everything that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meteorological bureaus had ever recorded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The vagaries of the lightning, and the frightful</seg><seg type="columnLine">power that it exhibited, were especially terrifying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In London the Victoria Tower was partly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mantled by a bolt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In Moscow the ancient and beautiful Church of</seg><seg type="columnLine">St. Basil was nearly destroyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The celebrated Leaning Tower of Pisa, the wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of centuries, was flung to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The vast dome of St, Peter's at Rome was said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been encased during three whole minutes with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blinding armor of electric fire, though the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">harm done was the throwing down of a statue in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the chapels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, strangest freak of all, in New York a tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous bolt, which seems to have entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pennsylvania tunnel on the Jersey side, followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rails under the river, throwing two trains from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the track, and, emerging in the great station in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of the city, expanded into a rose-colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere, which exploded with an awful report, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blew the great roof to pieces.

No such cometary monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever before been seen. People shuddered when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they looked at it. It moved with amazing speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping across the firmament like a besom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked out into the park near my house with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intention of viewing the great comet. The park</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my side (the west), is bordered with a dense</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen of tall trees, and I advanced toward the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">place in the center in order to have an unobstructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of the flaming stranger. As I passed across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the shadow of the trees--the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead being brilliantly illuminated by the light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the comet--I suddenly noticed, with an involuntary</seg><seg type="columnLine">start, that I was being preceded by a double shadow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which forked away from my feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I cast my eyes behind me to find the cause of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the phenomenon, and saw, to my inexpressible</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement, that the comet had divided into two.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were two distinct heads, already widely separ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated, but each, it seemed to me, as brilliant as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">original one had been, and each supplied with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast plume of fire a hundred degrees in length, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequently stretching far past the zenith. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of the double shadow was evident at once--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but what can have produced this sudden disruption</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the comet? It must have occurred since last</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening, and already, if the calculated distance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the comet is correct, the parts of the severed head</seg><seg type="columnLine">are 300,000 miles asunder!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Underneath this entry was scribbled:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can this have anything to do with Cosmo Ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sal's flood?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whether it had anything to do with the flood or</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, at any rate the public believed that it had.</seg><seg type="columnLine">People went about with fear written on their faces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The double shadoivs had a surprising effect.

The fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was nothing really mysterious about it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">made no difference. Even those who knew well that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was an inevitable optical result of the division</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bright comet were thrilled with instinctive</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread when they saw that forked shadow, mimick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their every movement. There is nothing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">so upsets the mind as a sudden change in the as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect of familiar things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The astronomers now took their turn. Those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were absolutely incredulous about Casmo's predic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and genuinely desirious of allaying the popular</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm, issued statements in which, with a disin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuousness that may have been unintentional, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to sidetrack his arguments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Pludder led the way with a pronuncia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mento declaring that "the absurd vaporings of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern Nostradamus of New York" had now demon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strated their own emptiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A comet," said Professor Pludder, with reassur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing seriousness, "cannot down the earth.

In this case there cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">even be an encounter; the comet is now moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Its division is not an unprecedented, occur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rence, for many previous comets have met with</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar accidents. This comet happened to be of</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual size, and the partition of the head occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it was relatively near-by--whence the start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling phenomena observed. There is nothing to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It will be remarked that Professor Pludder en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely avoided the real issue.

But when he read</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Pludder's statement, followed by others</seg><seg type="columnLine">of similar import, he took up the cudgels with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vengeance. All over the world, translated into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen languages, he scattered his reply, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect was startling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My fellow-citizens of the world in all lands, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of every race," he began, "you are face to face with</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction!

Curious multitudes constantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted and descended the long approaches, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept moving by the guards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside they wandered about astonished at what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three lower decks were devoted to the storage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of food and of fuel for the electric generators, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which Cosmo Vers&amp;l had been accumulating for</seg><seg type="columnLine">months.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above these were two decks, which the visitors</seg><seg type="columnLine">were informed would be occupied by animals, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">by boxes of seeds, and prepared roots of plants, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it was intended to restore the vegetable life</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planet after the water should have sufficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">receded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The five remaining decks were for human beings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were roomy quarters for the commander and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his officers, others for the crew, several large</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloons, and five hundred sets of apartments of vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous sizes to be occupied by the passengers whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo should choose to accompany him. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had all the convenience of the most luxurious state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms of the transoceanic liners. Many joking re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks were exchanged by the visitors as they in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected these rooms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo ran about among his guests, explaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything, showing great pride in his work, point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out a thousand particulars in which his fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight had been displayed--but, to everybody's</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment, he uttered no more warnings, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no appeals. On the contrary, as some ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servant persons noticed, he seemed to avoid any</seg><seg type="columnLine">reference to the fate of those who should not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">included in his ship's company.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some sensitive souls were disturbed by detecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eyes a look that seemed to express deep pity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and regret. Occasionally he would draw apart, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze at the passing crowds with a compassionate</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression, and then, slowly turning his back, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fingers worked nervously, would disappear, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">downcast head, into his private room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The comparatively few who particularly noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">this conduct of Cosmo's were deeply moved--more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than they had been by all the enigmatic events of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the past months. One man, Amos Blank, a rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">manufacturer, who was notorious for the merciless</seg><seg type="columnLine">methods that he had pursued in eliminating his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weaker competitors, was so much disturbed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo Vers&amp;Fs change of manner that he sought an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity to speak to him privately. Cosmo re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived him with a reluctance that he could not but</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice, and which, somehow, increased his anxiety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "--I--thought," said the billionaire hesitatingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that I ought--that is to say, that I might, perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquire--might inform myself--under what condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions one could, supposing the necessity to arise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtain a passage in your--in your ark. Of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question of cost does not enter in the matter--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not with me"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo gazed at the man coldly, and all the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passion that had recently softened his steely eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared. For a moment he did not speak. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, measuring his words and speaking with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">emphasis that chilled the heart of his listener:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Blank, the necessity has arisen"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you say--so you say--" began Mr. Blank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So I say," interrupted Cosmo sternly, "and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">say further that this ark has been constructed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save those who are worthy of salvation, in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all that is good and admirable in humanity may</seg><seg type="columnLine">not perish from the earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly, exactly," responded the other smiling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rubbing his hands.

He placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentinels at all entrances, and began the construc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of a shallow ditch, entirely enclosing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grounds. Public curiosity was intensely excited by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this singular proceeding, especially when it became</seg><seg type="columnLine">known that the workmen were stringing copper</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires the w'hole length of the ditch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the deuce is he up to now?" was the ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion on everybody's lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Cosmo and his employees gave evasive replies</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all inquiries. A great change had come about in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Como's treatment of the public. No one was any</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer encouraged to watch the operations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the wires were all placed and the ditch was</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished, it was covered up so that it made a broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat-topped dyke encircling the field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Speculation was rife for several days concerning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purpose of the mysterious ditch and its wires,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but no universally satisfactory explanation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One enterprising reporter worked out an elab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orate scheme, which he ascribed to Cosmo Vers&amp;l,</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to which the wired ditch was to serve as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cumulator of electricity, which would, at the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per moment, launch the ark upon the waters, thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoiding all danger of a fatal detention in case</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flood should rise too rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This seemed so absurd on its face that it went far</seg><seg type="columnLine">to quiet apprehension by reawakening doubts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo's sanity--the more especially since he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no attempt to contradict the assertion that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme was his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nobody guessed what his real intention was; if</seg><seg type="columnLine">people had guessed, it might have been bad for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace of mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next move of Cosmo Versal was taken with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out any knowledge or suspicion on the part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">public. He had now established himself in his apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments in the ark, and was never seen in the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One evening, when all was quiet about the ark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">night work being now unnecessary, Cosmo and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joseph Smith sat facing one another at a square</seg><seg type="columnLine">table lighted by a shaded lamp. Smith had a pile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of writing paper before him, and was evidently pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared to take notes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo's great brow was contracted with thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he leaned his cheek upon his hand. It was clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his meditations were troublesome. For at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least ten minutes he did not open his lips, and Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him anxiously. At last he said, speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Joseph, this is the most trying problem that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have had to solve. The success of all my work de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pends upon my not making a mistake now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The burden of responsibility that rests on ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders is such as no mortal has ever borne. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is too great for human capacity--and yet how can I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast it off?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am to decide who shall be saved! I, I alone, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo Versal, hold in my hands the fate of a race</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbering two thousand million souls the fate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of a planet which, without my intervention, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">become simply a vast tomb. It is for vie to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether the genus homo shall be perpetuated, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in what form it shall bo perpetuated. Joseph, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is terrible! These are the functions of deity, not of</seg><seg type="columnLine">man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joseph Smith seemed no longer to breathe, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">intense was his attention. His eyes glowed under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark brows, and his pencil trembled in his fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers. After a slight pause Cosmo Versal went on:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If I felt any doubt that Providence has fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordained me to do this work, and given me extra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary facilities, and extraordinary knowledge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enable me to perform it, I would, this instant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow out my brains."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Again he was silent, the secretary, after fidgeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, bending and unbending his brows, and tap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping nervously upon the table, at last said, solemnly:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Cosmo, you are ordained; you must do the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must," returned Cosmo Versal, 'I know that;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet the sense of my responsibility sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">covers me with a cloud of despair. The other day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the ark was crowded with curiosity seekers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought that not one of all those tens of thous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ands could escape, and that hundreds of millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">others must also be lost, overwhelmed me. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to reproach myself for not having been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">more effective agent in warning my fellows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their peril. Joseph, I have miserably failed. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to have produced universal conviction, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have not done it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is not your fault, Cosmo," said Joseph Smith,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching out his long arm to touch his leader's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. "It is an unbelieving generation. They have</seg><seg type="columnLine">rejected even the signs in the heavens. Tho voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an archangel would not have convinced them."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is true," replied Cosmo. "And the truth is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the more bitter to me because I spoke in the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">of science, and the very men who represent science</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been my most determined opponents, blinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people's eyes--after wilfully shutting their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You say you have been weak," interposed Smith,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"which you have not been; but you would be weak</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you now shrank from your plain duty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True!" cried Cosmo, in a changed voice. "Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">us then proceed. I had a lesson the other day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amos Blank came to me, puffed with his pillaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions. I saw then what I had to do. I told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly that he was not among the chosen. Hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that book."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The secretary pushed a large volume within</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo's reach.

You will</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember, Joseph, that the same conditions are said</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have prevailed in the time of Noah. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no science then, and we do not know exactly on what</seg><seg type="columnLine">principles the choice was made of those who should</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape; but the simple history of Noah shows that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and his friends represented the best manhood of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that age.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the seeds of corruption were not eliminated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the same problem recurs today.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have to determine whom I will save. I attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question by inquiring who represent the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">elements of humanity? Let us first consider men</seg><seg type="columnLine">by classes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And why not by races?" asked Smith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall not look to see whether a man is black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white or yellow; whether his skull is brachycephalic</seg><seg type="columnLine">or dolichocephalic," replied Cosmo. "I shall look</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside. No race has ever shown itself permanently</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then by classes you mean occupations?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, yes, for the occupation shows the tendency,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quintessence of character. Some men are born</seg><seg type="columnLine">rulers and leaders; others are born followers. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">are necessary, and I must have both kinds."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will begin perhaps with'the kings, the presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dents ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not at all.

"If my scientific brethren</seg><seg type="columnLine">have not seen as clearly as I have, the fault lies not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in science, but in lack of comprehension. Never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theless, they are on the right track; they have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gist of the matter in them; they are trained in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right method.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aged people and the children--there's the dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficulty. If I invite a man who possesses unquestion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able qualifications, but has a large family, what am</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	to do? I can't crowd out others as desirable as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the sake of carrying all of his stripes.

In a little while he .spoke again:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Another thing that I must fix is an age limit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But that will have to be subject to certain excep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions.

He knew that it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a drop in the bucket--although sufficient to</seg><seg type="columnLine">start the flood--and that the great thing to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared was the condensation of the aqueous nebula,</seg><seg type="columnLine">already beginning to enwrap the planet in its stifl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing folds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The public could understand the melting ice, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it could not fully understand the nebula; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could understand the swelling sea, and the raging</seg><seg type="columnLine">rivers, and the lakes breaking over their banks--*s</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the terror and despair became universal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what should they do?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those who had thought of building arks hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried to see if the work might not yet be completed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but most of them had begun their foundations on</seg><seg type="columnLine">low land, which was already submerged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a cry arose, terrible in its significance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its consequences--one of those cries that the van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished but unconquerable god Pan occasionally sets</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring, nobody can tell how:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cosmo's ark!

They came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from various directions, and united in a yelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">mob. They meant to carry the ark with a rush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would not be denied. As the excited throngs</seg><seg type="columnLine">neared the great vessel they saw its huge form ris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing like a mount of safety, with an American flag</seg><seg type="columnLine">flapping about it, and they broke into a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheer. On they sped, seized with the unreason of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd, shouting, falling over one another, strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling, fighting for places, men dragging their</seg><seg type="columnLine">wives and children through the awful crush, many</seg><seg type="columnLine">trampled helpless under the myriads of struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet--driving the last traces of sanity from one an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's minds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The foremost ranks presently spied Cosmo Vers&amp;l,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching them from an open gangway sixty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">above their heads.

Wicked blue-green sparks</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasionally flashed above the struggling mass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The explanation was clear. Cosmo, foreseeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the probability of a despairing attack, had sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded the ark with an impassable electric barrier.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sound of a whirring dynamo could be heard. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous current was flowing through the hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires and transmitting its paralyzing energy to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic crest of the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still those behind pushed on, until rank after</seg><seg type="columnLine">rank had sunk helpless at the impregnable line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">defense.

Many lay for a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless upon the sodden ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo and Joseph Smith, who had now appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his side, continued to shout warnings, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to be heeded when the nature of the obstacle</seg><seg type="columnLine">became known. The rush was stopped, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitude stood at bay, dazed, and uncertain what</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do. Then a murmur arose, growing louder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more angry and threatening, until suddenly a shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">was heard in the midst of the crowd, and Cosmo</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seen to start backward, while Joseph Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly dodged out of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A cry arose:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shoot him! That's right! Shoot the devil!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's a witch! He's drowning the world!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They meant it--at least, half of them did. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the logic of terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hundreds of shots were now fired from all</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters, and heads that had been seen flitting be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the various portholes instantly disappeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bullets rattled on the huge sides of the ark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they came from small pistols and had not force</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to penetrate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo Versal alone remained in sight.

One after</seg><seg type="columnLine">another they whistled by Cosmo's head and flatten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed themselves upon the metal-work behind. Cosmo</seg><seg type="columnLine">Versal, untouched, folded his arms and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight at his foe. The man, staring a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusedly, as if he could not comprehend his</seg><seg type="columnLine">failure, threw up his arms with a despairing ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, and fell prone upon the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then yells and shots once more broke out. Cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mo stepped back, and a great metallic door swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to, closing the gang-way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But three minutes later the door opened, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mob saw two machine-guns trained upon them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once more Cosmo appeared, with the trumpet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you fire again," he cried, "I shall spray you</seg><seg type="columnLine">with bullets. I have told you how you can pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">long your lives. Now go!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not another shot was fired. In the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns, whose terrible power all comprehended, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one dared to make a hostile movement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, perhaps, if Cosmo Versal had not set new</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts running in the minds of the assailants by</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling them there was temporary safety to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found by seeking high ground, even the terror of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guns would not have daunted them. Now their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopefulness was reawakened, and many began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponder upon his words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He says we must perish, and yet that we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">find safety in the hills and mountains," said one</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. "I believe half of that is a lie. We are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to be drowned. The water won't rise much</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher.

Then in the case of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">excisions you have'all kinds of secondary changes,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pigmentary disturbances, modifications of the pas-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sions, alterations in the secretion of fatty tissue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I have no doubt you have heard of these thing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Of course," said I.

There is building up as well as breaking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down and changing. You have heard, perhaps, of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a common surgical opera-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion resorted to in cases</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">where the nose has been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">destroyed: a flap of skin</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is cut from the forehead,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turned down on the nose,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and heals in the new posi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion. This is a kind of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grafting in a new position</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of part of an animal ap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on itself. Grafting of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">freshly obtained material</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from another animal is al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so possible,--the case of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">teeth, for example. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grafting of skin and bone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is done to facilitate healing: the surgeon places in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the middle of the wound pieces of skin snipped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from another animal, or fragments of bone from a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">victim freshly killed. Hunter's cockspur--possibly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you have heard of that--flourished on the bull's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">neck; and the rhinoceros rats of the Algerian</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">zouaves are also to be thought of,--monsters manu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">factured by transferring a slip from the tail of an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ordinary rat to its snout, and allowing it to heal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in that position."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Monsters manufactured!'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mean to tell me--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said I.

It all lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the surface of practical anatomy years ago, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one had the temerity to touch it. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">not simply the outward form of an animal which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can change. The physiology, the chemical rhythm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the creature, may also be made to undergo an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enduring modification,--of which vaccination and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other methods of inoculation with living or dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter are examples that will, no doubt, be familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you. A similar operation is the transfusion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood,--with which subjeot, indeed, I began. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">are all familiar cases. Less so, and probably far</seg><seg type="columnLine">more extensive, were the operations of those mediae-</seg><seg type="columnLine">val practitioners who made dwarfs and beggar-crip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ples, show-monsters,--some vestiges of whose art</seg><seg type="columnLine">still remain in the preliminary manipulation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young mountebank or contortionist. Victor Hugo</seg><seg type="columnLine">gives an account of them in 'L'Homme qui Hit.'--</seg><seg type="columnLine">But perhaps ray meaning grows plain now. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin to see that it is a possible thing to transplant</seg><seg type="columnLine">tissue from one part of an animal to another, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one animal to another; to alter its chemical</seg><seg type="columnLine">reactions and methods of growth; to modify the</seg><seg type="columnLine">articulations of its limbs; and, indeed, to change</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in its most intimate structure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And yet this extraordinary branch of knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">has never been sought as an end, and systematically,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by modern investigators until I took it up! Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such things have been hit upon in the last re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of surgery; most of the kindred evidence that</seg><seg type="columnLine">will recur to your mind has been demonstrated as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were by accident,--by tyrants, by criminals, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breeders of horses and dogs, by all kinds of un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained, clumsy-handed men working for their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediate ends. I was the first man to take up this</seg><seg type="columnLine">question armed with antiseptic surgery, and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">really scientific knowledge of the laws of growth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet one would imagine it must have been practised</seg><seg type="columnLine">in secret before. Such creatures as the Siamese</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twins--And in the vaults of the Inquisition. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt their chief aim was artistic torture, but some</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least of the inquisitors must have had a touch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific curiosity."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," said I, "these things--these animals talk!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said that was so, and proceeded to point out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the possibility of vivisection does not stop at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mere physical metamorphosis. A pig may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">educated. The mental structure is even less deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minate than the bodily. In our growing science of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypnotism we find the promise of a possibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">superseding old inherent instincts by new sugges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, grafting upon or replacing the inherited fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas. Very much indeed of what we call moral</seg><seg type="columnLine">education, ho said, is such an artificial modification</seg><seg type="columnLine">and perversion of instinct; pugnacity is trained in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to courageous self-sacrifice, and suppressed sexual-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity into religious emotion. And the great differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence between man and monkey is in the larynx,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he continued,--'in the incapacity to frame deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cately different sound-symbols by which thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be sustained. In this I failed to agree with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but with a certafh incivility he declined to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">notice my objection. He repeated that the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so, and continued his account of his work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I asked him why he had taken the human form</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a model.

"I might just as well have worked to form</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheep into llamas and llamas into sheep. I suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is something in the human form that appeals</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the artistic turn more powerfully than any</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal shape can.

But what does it</seg><seg type="columnLine">show? The capacity for pain is not needed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscle, and it is not placed there,--is but little</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed in the skin, and only here and there over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thigh is a spot capable of feeling pain.

Pain, pain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure, they are for us only so long as we wriggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see, I went on with this research just the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way it led me. That is the only way I ever heard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">true research going. I asked a question, devised</seg><seg type="columnLine">some method of obtaining an answer, and got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh question. Was this possible or that possible?</seg><seg type="columnLine">You cannot imagine what this means to an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigator, what an intellectual passion grows up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him! You cannot imagine the strange, colourless</seg><seg type="columnLine">delight of these intellectual desires! The thing be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore you is no longer an animal, a fellow-creature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a problem! Sympathetic pain,--all I know of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">I remember as a thing I used to suffer from years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago. I wanted--it was the one thing I wanted--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out the extreme limit of plasticity in a living</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," said I, "the thing is an abomination--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To this day I have never troubled about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ethics of the matter," he continued. "The study</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Nature makes a man at last as remorseless as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nature. I have gone on, not heeding anything but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question I was pursuing; and the material has</seg><seg type="columnLine">--dripped into the huts yonder. It is really eleven</seg><seg type="columnLine">years since we came here, I and Montgomery and</seg><seg type="columnLine">six Kanakas. I remember the green stillness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island and the empty ocean about us, as though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was yesterday. The place seemed waiting for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The stores were landed and the house was</seg><seg type="columnLine">built. The Kanakas founded some huts near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravine. I went to work here upon what I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought with me. There were some disagreeable</seg><seg type="columnLine">things happened at first. I began with a sheep, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed it after a day and a half by a slip of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scalpel. I took another sheep, and made a thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pain and fear and left it bound up to heal. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked quite human to me when I had finished it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but when I went to it I was discontented with it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It remembered me, and was terrified beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination; and it had no more than the wits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a sheep. The more I looked at it the clumsier</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed, until at last I put the monster out of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">misery. These animals without courage, these fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunted, pain-driven things, without a spark of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pugnacious energy to face torment,--they are no</seg><seg type="columnLine">good for man-making.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I took a gorilla I had; and upon that, work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with infinite care and mastering difficulty after</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty, I made my first man. All the week, night</seg><seg type="columnLine">and day, I moulded him. With him it was chiefly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brain that needed moulding; much had to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">added, much changed. I thought him a fair speci-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">men of the negroid type when I had finished him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he lay bandaged, bound, and motionless before</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. It was only when his life was assured that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">left him and came into this room again, and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montgomery much as you are. He had heard some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cries as the thing grew human,--cries like</seg><seg type="columnLine">those that disturbed you so. I didn't take him</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely into my. confidence at first. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kanakas too, had realised something of it. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were scared out of their wits by the sight of me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got Montgomery over to me--in a way; but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he had the hardest job to prevent the Kanakas</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserting. Finally they did; and so we lost the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yacht. I spent many days educating the brute,--</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether I had him for three or four months.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I taught him the rudiments of English; gave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas of counting; even made the thing read the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alphabet. But at that he was slow, though I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">met with idiots slower. He began with a clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheet, mentally; had no memories left in his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what he had been. When his scars were quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">healed, and he was no longer anything but painful</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stiff, and able to converse a little, I took him</seg><seg type="columnLine">yonder and introduced him to the Kanakas as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting stowaway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They were horribly afraid of him at first, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how,--which offended me rather, for I was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceited about him; but his ways seemed so mild, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was so abject, that after a time they received</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and took his education in hand. He was quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn, very imitative and adaptive, and built him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self a hovel rather better, it seemed to me, than</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own shanties. There was one among the boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit of a missionary, and he taught the thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">read, or at least to pick out letters, and gave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">some rudimentary ideas of morality; but it seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beast's habits were not all that is desirable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I rested from work for some days after this, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in a mind to write an account of the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair to wake up English physiology. Then I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the creature squatting up in a tree and gibber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at two of the Kanakas who had been teasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. I threatened him, told him the inhumanity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a proceeding, aroused his sense of shame, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came home resolved to do better before I took my</seg><seg type="columnLine">work back to England. I have been doing better.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But somehow the things drift back again: the stub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">born beast-flesh grows day by day back again.

This puma--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But that's the story. All the Kanaka boys are</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead now; one fell overboard off the launch, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">died of a wounded heel that he poisoned in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">way with plant-juice. Three went away in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yacht, and I suppose and hope were drowned. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other one--was killed.

It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">purely an experiment. It was a limbless thing, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a horrible face, that writhed along the ground in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a serpentine fashion. It was immensely strong, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in infuriating pain. It lurked in the woods for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, until we hunted it; and then it wriggled into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the northern part of the island, and we divided</seg><seg type="columnLine">the party to close in upon it. Montgomery insisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon coming with me. The man had a rifle; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when his body was found, one of the barrels was</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved into the shape of an S and very nearly bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten through.

After</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I stuck to the ideal of humanity--except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">little things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He became silent. I sat in silence watching his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So for twenty years altogether--counting nine</seg><seg type="columnLine">years in England--I have been going on; and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is still something in everything I do that defeats</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, makes me dissatisfied, challenges me to further</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort. Sometimes I rise above my level, sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">I fall below it; but always I fall short of the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">I dream. The human shape I can get now, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">with ease, so that it is lithe and graceful, or thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strong; but often there is trouble with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and the claws,--painful things, that I dare</seg><seg type="columnLine">not shape too freely. But it is in the subtle graft-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and reshaping one must needs do to the brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my trouble lies. The intelligence is often odd-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly low, with unaccountable blank ends, unexpected</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaps. And least satisfactory of all is something</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I cannot touch, somewhere--I cannot deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine where--in the seat of the emotions. Cravings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instincts, desires that harm humanity, a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden reservoir to burst forth suddenly and inun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">date the whole being of the creature with anger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate, or fear. These creatures of mine seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange and uncanny to you so soon as you began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to observe them; but to me, just after I make them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they seem to be indisputably human beings. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterwards, as I observe them, that the persuasion</seg><seg type="columnLine">fades. First one animal trait, then another, creeps</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the surface and stares out at me. But I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquer yet! Each time I dip a living creature into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bath of burning pain, I say, 'This time I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">burn out all the animal; this time I will make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rational creature of my own!' After all, what is</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten years? Men have been a hundred thousand in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the making." He thought darkly. "But I am draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing near the fastness. This puma of mine--" After</seg><seg type="columnLine">a silence, "And they revert. As soon as my hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">is taken from them the beast begins to creep back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">begins to assert itself again." Another long silence,,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you take the things you make into those</seg><seg type="columnLine">dens?" said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They go.

There is a kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of travesty of humanity over there. Montgomery</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows about it, for he interferes in their affairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He has trained one or two of them to our service.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's ashamed of it, but I believe he half likes some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those beasts. It's his business, not mine. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">only sicken me with a sense of failure. I take no</seg><seg type="columnLine">iotcrodt in there. I fancy they follow in the lines</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kanaka missionary marked out, and have a kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mockery of a rational life, poor beasts!

They build themselves their dens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathor fruit, and pull herbs---marry even. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can see through it all, see into their very souls, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">see there nothing but the souls of beasts, beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">that perish, anger and the lusts to live and gratify</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves.--Yet they're odd; complex, like every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else alive. There is a kind of upward striving</seg><seg type="columnLine">in them, part vanity, part waste sexual emotion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">part waste curiosity. It only mocks me. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">some hope of that puma. I have worked hard at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head and brain--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now," said he, standing up after a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">gap of silence, during which we had each pursued</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own thoughts, "what do you think? Are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fear of me still?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked at him, and saw but a white-faced, white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired man, with calm eyes. Save for his serenity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the touch almost of beauty that resulted from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">set tranquillity and his magnificent build, he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have passed muster among a hundred other com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable old gentlemen. Then I shivered. By way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of answer to his second question, I handed him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver with either hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep them," he said, and snatched at a yawn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stood up, stared at me for a moment, and smiled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You have had two eventful days," said he. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should advise some sleep. I'm glad it's all clear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good-night." He thought me over for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then went out by the inner door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I immediately turned the key in the outer one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sat down again; sat for a time in a kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stagnant mood, so weary, emotionally, mentally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and physically, that I could not think beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point at which he had left me. The black window</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at me like an eye. At last with an effort I</seg><seg type="columnLine">put out the light and got into the hammock. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon I was asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XV</seg><seg type="columnLine">Concerning the Beast Folk</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I WOKE early. Moreau's explanation stood be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore my mind, clear and definite, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment of my awakening. I got out of the»</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammock and went to the door to assure myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the key was turned. Then I tried the window-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar, and found it firmly fixed. That these man-liko</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures were in truth only bestial monsters, mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">grotesque travesties of men, filled me with a vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertainty of their possibilities which was far</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse than any definite fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A tapping came at the door, and I heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glutinous accents of M'ling speaking. I pocketed</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the revolvers (keeping one hand upon it),</seg><seg type="columnLine">and opened to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-morning, sair," he said, bringing in, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">addition to the customary herb-breakfast, an ill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooked rabbit. Montgomery followed him. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">roving eye caught the position of my arm and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled askew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The puma was resting to heal that day; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreau, who was singularly solitary in his habits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not join us. I talked with Montgomery to clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ideas of the way in which the Beast Folk</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lived. In particular, I was urgent to know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">these inhuman monsters were kept from falling up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Moreau and Montgomery and from rending ono</seg><seg type="columnLine">another. He explained to me that the comparative</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety of Moreau and himself was due to the limited</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental scope of these monsters. In spite of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased intelligence and the tendency of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal instincts to reawaken, they had certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed ideas implanted by Moreau in their minds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which absolutely bounded their imaginations. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were really hypnotised; had been told that certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">things were impossible, and that certain things</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not to be done, and these prohibitions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">woven into the texture of their minds beyond any</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility of disobedience or dispute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Certain matters, however, in which old instinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at war with Moreau's convenience, were in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">less stable condition. A series of propositions called</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Law (I had already heard them recited) battled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their minds with the deep-seated, ever-rebellious</seg><seg type="columnLine">cravings of their animal natures. This Law they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ever repeating, I found, and ever breaking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both Montgomery and Moreau displayed particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">solicitude to keep them ignorant of the taste of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood; they feared the inevitable suggestion's of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that flavour. Montgomery told me that the Law,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially among the feline Beast People, became</seg><seg type="columnLine">oddly weakened about nightfall; that then the ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal was at its strongest; that a spirit of adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang up in them at the dusk, when they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare things they never seemed to dream about by</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. To that I owed my stalking by the Leopard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, on the night of my arrival. But during these</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier days of my stay they broke the Law only</seg><seg type="columnLine">furtively and after dark; in the daylight there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a general atmosphere of respect for its multifarious</seg><seg type="columnLine">prohibitions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And here perhaps I may give a few general facts</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the island and the Beast People. The island,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was of irregular outline and lay low upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide sea, had a total area, I suppose, of seven or</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight square miles.1 It was volcanic in origin, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now fringed on three sides by coral reefs; some</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumaroles to the northward, and a hot spring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the only vestiges of the forces that had long</seg><seg type="columnLine">since originated it. Now and then a faint quiver</seg><seg type="columnLine">of earthquake would be sensible, and sometimes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascent of the spire of smoke would be rendered</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumultuous by gusts of steam; but that was all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The population of the island, Montgomery informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, now numbered rather more than sixty of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange creations of Moreau's art, not counting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smaller monstrosities which lived in the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth and were without human form. Altogether</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had made nearly a hundred and twenty; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">many had died, and others--like the writhing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Footless Thing of which he had told me--had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">by violent ends. In answer to my question, Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gomery said that they actually bore offspring, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these generally died. When they lived, Moreau</seg><seg type="columnLine">took them and stamped the human form upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. There was no evidence of the inheritance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their acquired human characteristics. The females</seg><seg type="columnLine">were less numerous than the males, and liable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">much furtive persecution in spite of the monogamy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Law enjoined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would be impossible for me to describe these</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  'This description corresponds in every respect to Noble's Isle--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Beast People in detail; my eye has had no training</seg><seg type="columnLine">in details, and unhappily I cannot sketch. Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking, perhaps, in their general appearance was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disproportion between the legs of these crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures and the length of their bodies; and yet--</seg><seg type="columnLine">so relative is our idea of grace--my eye became</seg><seg type="columnLine">habituated to their forms, and at last I even fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">in with their persuasion that my own long thighs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ungainly. Another point was the forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriage of the head, and the clumsy and inhuman</seg><seg type="columnLine">curvature of the spine. Even the Ape-man lacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">that inward sinuous curve of the back which makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the human figure so graceful. Most had their</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders hunched clumsily, and their short fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms hung weakly at their sides. Few of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were conspicuously hairy, at least until the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my time upon the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next most obvious deformity was in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces, almost all of which were prognathous, mal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed about the ears, with large and protuberant</seg><seg type="columnLine">noses, very furry or very bristly hair, and often</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely-coloured or strangely-placed eyes. None</seg><seg type="columnLine">could laugh, though the Ape-man had a chattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">titter. Beyond these general characters their heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">had little in common; each preserved the quality of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its particular species: the human mark distorted</seg><seg type="columnLine">but did not hide the leopard, the ox, or the sow, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">other animal or animals, from which the creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been moulded. The voices, too, varied exceed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly. The hands were always malformed; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">though some surprised me by their unexpected</seg><seg type="columnLine">human appearance, almost all were deficient in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of the digits, clumsy about the finger-nails,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lacking any tactile sensibility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two most formidable Animal Men were my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leopard-man and a creature made of hyena and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swine. Larger than these were the three bull-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures who rowed in the boat. Then came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silvery-hairy-man, who was also the Sayer of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Law, M'ling, and a satyr-like creature of ape and</seg><seg type="columnLine">goat. There were three Swine-men and a Swine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, a mare-rhinoceros-creature, and several</seg><seg type="columnLine">other females whose sources I did not ascertain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were several wolf-creatures, a bear-bull, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Saint-Bernard-man. I have already described</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ape-man, and there was a particularly hateful</seg><seg type="columnLine">(and evil-smelling) old woman made of vixen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear, whom I hated from the beginning.

Both of us carried whips and loaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolvers. While going through a leafy jungle on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our road thither, we heard a rabbit squealing. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">■stopped and listened, but we heard no more; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently we went on our way, and the incident</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped out of our minds. Montgomery called</seg><seg type="columnLine">my attention to certain little pink animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">with long hind-legs, that went leaping through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the undergrowth. He told me they were creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of the offspring of the Beast People, that Mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eau had invented. He had fancied they might serve</seg><seg type="columnLine">for meat, but a rabbit-like habit of devouring their</seg><seg type="columnLine">young had defeated this intention. I had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">encountered some of these creatures,--once during</seg><seg type="columnLine">my moonlight flight from the Leopard-man, and once</seg><seg type="columnLine">during my pursuit by Moreau on the previous day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By chance, one hopping to avoid us leapt into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole caused by the uprooting of a wind-blown tree;</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it could extricate itself we managed to catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. It spat like a cat, scratched and kicked vigor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously with its hind-legs, and made an attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bite; but its teeth were too feeble to inflict more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a painless pinch. It seemed to me rather a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty little creature; and as Montgomery stated</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it never destroyed the turf by burrowing, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very cleanly in its habits, I should imagine it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might prove a convenient substitute for the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">/mon rabbit in gentlemen's parks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We also saw on our way the trunk of a tree</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">barked in long strips and splintered deeply.

"Much</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some of them care for it!" It was after this, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">think, that we met the Satyr and the Ape-man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Satyr was a gleam of classical memory on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">part of Moreau,--his face bovine in expression, like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the coaser Hebrew type; his voice a harsh bleat,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his nether extremities Satanic.

"It is a pretty sight!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moreau said not a word on the way, but the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression of his heavy, white-fringed face was grim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly set.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We crossed the ravine down which smoked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream of hot water, and followed the winding path-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way through the canebrakes until we reached a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">area covered over with a thick, powdery yellow sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance which I believe was sulphur. Above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder of a weedy bank the sea glittered. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to a kind of shallow natural amphitheatre, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">here the four of us halted.

Then at three</seg><seg type="columnLine">or four points on the edge of the sulphurous area</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared the grotesque forms of the Beast People</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurrying towards us. I could not help a creeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror, as I perceived first one and then another trot</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from the trees or reeds and come shambling</seg><seg type="columnLine">along over the hot dust. But Moreau and Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gomery stood calmly enough; and, perforce, I stuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First to arrive was the Satyr, strangely unreal</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all that he cast a shadow and tossed the dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his hoofs. After him from the brake came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a monstrous lout, a thing of horse and rhinoceros,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chewing a straw as it came; then appeared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swine-woman and two Wolf-women; then the Fox-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear witch, with her red eyes in her peaked red</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, and then others,--all hurrying eagerly.

As soon as they had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">approached within a distance of perhaps thirty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yards they halted, and bowing on knees and elbows</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">began flinging the white dust upon their heads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Imagine the scene if you can!

"None escape," repeated the kneel-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing circle of Beast People.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Who is he?" cried Moreau, and looked round at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their faces, cracking his whip. I fancied the Hyena-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swine looked dejected, so too did the Leopard-man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Moreau stopped, facing this creature, who cringed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">towards him with the memory and dread of infinite</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">torment. "Who is he?" repeated Moreau, in a voice</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of thunder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Evil is he who breaks the Law," chanted the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Sayer of the Law.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Moreau looked into the eyes of the Leopard-man,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and seemed to be dragging the very soul out of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">creature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who breaks the Law--" said Moreau, taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes off his victim, and turning toward us (it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to me there was a touch of exultation in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice).</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Goes back to the House of Pain," they all clam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oured,--"goes back to the House of Pain, 0 Mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Back to the House of Pain,--back to the House</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Pain," gabbled the Ape-man, as though the idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sweet to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you hear?" said Moreau, turning back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the criminal, "my friend--Hullo!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the Leopard-man, released from Moreau's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye, had risen straight from his knees, and now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with eyes aflame and his huge feline tusks flashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from under his curling lips, leapt towards his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tormentor. I am convinced that only the madness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unendurable fear could have prompted this at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack. The whole circle of threescore monsters</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to rise about us. I drew my revolver. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">two figures collided. I saw Moreau reeling back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Leopard-man's blow. There was a furious</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelling and howling all about us. Every one was</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving rapidly. For a moment I thought it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">general revolt. The furious face of the Leopard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man flashed by mine, with M'ling close in pursuit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw the yellow eyes of the Hyena-swine blazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with excitement, his attitude as if he were half re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved to attack me. The Satyr, too, glared at me</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the Hyena-swine's hunched shoulders. I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crack of Moreau's pistol, and saw the pink flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">dart across the tumult. The whole crowd seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to swing round in the direction of the glint of fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I too was swung round by the magnetism of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the movement. In another second I was running,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of a tumultuous shouting crowd, in pursuit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the escaping Leopard-man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That is all I can tell definitely. I saw the Leo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pard-man strike Moreau, and then everything spun</seg><seg type="columnLine">about me until I was running headlong. M'ling</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ahead, close in pursuit of the fugitive. Behind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their tongues already lolling out, ran the Wolf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">women in great leaping strides. The Swine folk</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed, squealing with excitement, and the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bull-men in their swathings of white. Then came</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreau in a cluster of the Beast People, his wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brimmed straw hat blown off, his revolver in hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his lank white hair streaming out. The Hyena-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swine ran beside me, keeping pace with me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glancing furtively at me out of his canine eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the others came pattering and shouting behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Leopard-man went bursting his way through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long canes, which sprang back as he passed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rattled in M'ling's face. We others in the rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a trampled path for us when we reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brake. The chase lay through the brake for per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps a quarter of a mile, and then plunged into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense thicket, which retarded our movements ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceedingly, though we went through it in a crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">together,--fronds flicking into our faces, ropy</seg><seg type="columnLine">creepers catching us under the chin or gripping our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ankles, thorny plants hooking into and tearing cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flesh together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has gone on all-fours through this," panted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreau, now just ahead of me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None escape," said the Wolf-bear, laughing into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my face with the exultation of hunting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We burst out again among rocks, and saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarry ahead running lightly on all-fours and snarl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at us over his shoulder. At that the Wolf Folk</seg><seg type="columnLine">howled with delight. The Thing was still clothed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at a distance its face still seemed human; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the carriage of its four limbs was feline, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">furtive droop of its shoulder was distinctly that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hunted animal. It leapt over some thorny yellow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowering bushes, and was hidden. M'ling was half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way across the space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most of us now had lost the first speed of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chase, and had fallen into a longer and steadier</seg><seg type="columnLine">stride. I saw as we traversed the open that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuit was now spreading from a column into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">line. The Ilyena-swine still ran close to me, watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me as it ran, every now and then puckering its</seg><seg type="columnLine">muzzle with a snarling laugh. At the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks the Leopard-man, realising that he was mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for the projecting cape upon which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalked me on the night of my arrival, had doubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the undergrowth; but Montgomery had seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manceuvre, and turned him again. So, panting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumbling against rocks, torn by brambles, impeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by ferns and reeds, I helped to pursue the Leopard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had broken the Law, and the Hyena-swine</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran, laughing savagely, by my side. I staggered on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head reeling and my heart beating against my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribs, tired almost to death, and yet not daring to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose sight of the chase lest I should be left alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">with this horrible companion. I staggered on in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of infinite fatigue and the dense heat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropical afternoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the fury of the hunt slackened. We had</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinned the wretched brute into a corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island. Moreau, whip in hand, marshalled us all</seg><seg type="columnLine">into an irregular line, and we advanced now slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting to one another as we advanced and tight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening the cordon about our victim. He lurked</seg><seg type="columnLine">noiseless and invisible in the bushes through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had run from him during that midnight pursuit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steady!" cried Moreau, "steady!" as the ends</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the line crept round the tangle of undergrowth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hemmed the brute in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ware a rush!" came the voice of Montgomery</seg><seg type="columnLine">from beyond the thicket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was on the slope above the bushes; Montgomery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Moreau beat along the beach beneath. Slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">we pushed in among the fretted network of branches</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaves. The quarry was silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Back to the House of Pain, the House of Pain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the House of Pain!" yelped the voice of the Ape-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, some twenty yards to the right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I heard that, I forgave the poor wretch all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fear he had inspired in me. I heard the twigs</seg><seg type="columnLine">snap and the boughs swish aside before the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">tread of the Horse-rhinoceros upon my right. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly through a polygon of green, in the half</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness under the luxuriant growth, I saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature we were hunting. I halted. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched together into the smallest possible com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass, his luminous green eyes turned over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder regarding me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It may seem a strange contradiction in me,--I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot explain the fact,--but now, seeing the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture there in a perfectly animal attitude, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light gleaming in its eyes and its imperfectly human</seg><seg type="columnLine">face distorted with terror, I realised again the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its humanity. In another moment other of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuers would see it, and it would be overpowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and captured, to experience once more the horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">tortures of the enclosure. Abruptly I slipped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">my revolver, aimed between its terror-struck eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fired. As I did so, the Hyena-swine saw tho</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thing, and flung itself upon it with an eager cry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrusting thirsty teeth into its neck. All about me</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green masses of the thicket were swaying and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracking as the Beast People came rushing to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether. One face and then another appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't kill it, Prendick!" cried Moreau. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill it!" and I saw him stooping as he pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through under the fronds of the big ferns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another moment he had beaten off the Hyena-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swine with the handle of his whip, and he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montgomery were keeping away the excited carni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vorous Beast People, and particularly M'ling, from!</seg><seg type="columnLine">the still quivering body. The hairy-grey Thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">came sniffing at the corpse under my arms. Tho</seg><seg type="columnLine">other animals, in their animal ardour, jostled me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a nearer view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Confound you, Prendick!" said Moreau. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sorry," said I, though I was not. "It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impulse of the moment." I felt sick with exer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and excitement. Turning, I pushed my way out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crowding Beast People and went on alone up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slope towards the higher part of the headland.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Under the shouted directions of Moreau I heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three white-swathed Bull-men begin dragging the</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim down towards the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was easy now for me to be alone. The Beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">People manifested a quite human curiosity about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead body, and followed it in a thick knot; sniff-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and growling at it as the Bull-men dragged it</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the beach. I went to the headland and watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the Bull-men, black against the evening sky, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they carried the weighted dead body out to sea; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a wave across my mind came the realisation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unspeakable aimlessness of things upon the is-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. Upon the beach among the rocks beneath me</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the Ape-man, the Hyena-swine, and several</seg><seg type="columnLine">other of the Beast People, standing about Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gomery and Moreau. They were all still intensely</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited, and all overflowing with noisy expressions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their loyalty to the Law; yet I felt an absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">assurance in my own mind that the Hyena-swine</seg><seg type="columnLine">was implicated in the rabbit-killing. A strange per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suasion came upon me, that, save for the grossness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the line, the grotesqueness of the forms, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">here before me the whole balance of human life in</seg><seg type="columnLine">miniature, the whole interplay of instinct, reason,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fate in its simplest form. The Leopard-man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to go under; that was all the difference.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poor brute!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poor brutes! I began to see the viler aspect of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreau's cruelty. I had not thought before of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain and trouble that came to these poor victims</seg><seg type="columnLine">after they had passed from Moreau's hands. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivered only at the days of actual torment in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosure. But now that seemed to me the lesser</seg><seg type="columnLine">part. Before, they had been beasts, their instincts</seg><seg type="columnLine">712</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fitly adapted to their surroundings, and happy as</seg><seg type="columnLine">living things may he. Now they stumbled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shackles of humanity, lived in a fear that never</seg><seg type="columnLine">died, fretted by a law they could not understand;</seg><seg type="columnLine">their mock-human existence, begun in an agony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one long internal struggle, one long dread of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreau--and for what? It was the wantonness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it that stirred me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had Moreau had any intelligible object, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have sympathised at least a little with him. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so squeamish about pain as that. I could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgiven him a little even, had his motive been only</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate. But he was so irresponsible, so utterly care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less ! His curiosity, his mad, aimless investigations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove him on; and the Things were thrown out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live a year or so, to struggle and blunder and suffer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at last to die painfully. They were wretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">in themselves; the old animal hate moved them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble one another; the Law held them back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brief hot struggle and a decisive end to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural animosities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In those days my fear of the Beast People went</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way of my personal fear for Moreau. I fell in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed into a morbid state, deep and enduring, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">alien to fear, which has left permanent scars upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind. I must confess that I lost faith in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanity of the world when I saw it suffering the pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful disorder of this island. A blind Fate, a vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitiless Mechanism, seemed to cut and shape the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fabric of existence; and I, Moreau (by his passion</seg><seg type="columnLine">for research), Montgomery (by his passion for</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink), the Beast People with their instincts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental restrictions, were torn and crushed, ruth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly, inevitably, amid the infinite complexity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its incessant wheels. But this condition did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">come all at once: I think indeed that I anticipate a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little in speaking of it now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           CHAPTER XVII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           A Catastrophe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SCARCELY six weeks passed before I had lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">every feeling but dislike and abhorrence for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this infamous experiment of Moreau's. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">one idea was to get away from these horrible cari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">catures of my Maker's image, back to the sweet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholesome intercourse of men. My fellow-crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, from whom I was thus separated, began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">assume idyllic virtue and beauty in my memory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My first friendship with Montgomery did not in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crease. His long separation from humanity, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret vice of drunkenness, his evident sympathy</seg><seg type="columnLine">with thevBeast People, tainted him to me. Several</seg><seg type="columnLine">times I let him go alone among them. I avoided</seg><seg type="columnLine">intercourse with them in every possible way. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent an increasing proportion of my time upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach, looking for some liberating sail that never</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared,--until one day there fell upon us an ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">palling disaster, which put an altogether different</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspect upon my strange surroundings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was about seven or eight weeks after my land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing,--rather more, I think, though I had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled to keep account of the time,--when this</seg><seg type="columnLine">catastrophe occurred. It happened in the early</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning--I should think about six. I had risen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfasted early, having been aroused by the noise</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of three Beast Men carrying wood into the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After breakfast I went to the open gateway of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enclosure, and stood there smoking a cigarette</seg><seg type="columnLine">and enjoying the freshness of the early morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreau presently came round the corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosure and greeted me. He passed by me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard him behind me unlock and enter his labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory. So indurated was I at that time to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">abomination of the place, that I heard without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of emotion the puma victim begin another day</seg><seg type="columnLine">of torture. It met its persecutor with a shriek, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most exactly like that of an angry virago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly something happened,--I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what, to this day. I heard a short, sharp cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind me, a fall, and turning saw an awful face</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing upon me,--not human, not animal, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">hellish, brown, seamed with red branching scars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">red drops starting out upon it, and the lidless eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">ablaze. I threw up my arm to defend myself from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blow that flung me headlong with a broken fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm; and the great monster, swathed in lint and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with red-stained bandages fluttering about it, leapt</seg><seg type="columnLine">over me and passed. I rolled over and over down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beach, tried to sit up, and collapsed upon my</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken arm. Then Moreau appeared, his massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">white face all the more terrible for the blood that</seg><seg type="columnLine">trickled from his forehead. He carried a revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one hand. He scarcely glanced at me, but rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">off at once in pursuit of the-puma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried the other arm and sat up. The muffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure In front ran in great striding leaps along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach, and Moreau followed her. She turned her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and saw him, then doubling abruptly made for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bushes. She gained upon him at every stride.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw her plunge into them, and Moreau, running</seg><seg type="columnLine">slantingly to intercept her, fired and missed as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared. Then he too vanished in the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stared after them, and then the pain in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm flamed up, and with a groan I staggered to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. Montgomery appeared in the doorway, dressed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with his revolver in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great God, Prendick!" he said, not noticing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was hurt, "that brute's loose! Tore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fetter out of the wall! Have you seen him?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then sharply, seeing I gripped my arm, "What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was standing in the doorway," said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came forward and took my arm. "Blood on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sleeve," said he, and rolled back the flannel. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocketed his weapon, felt my arm about painfully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and led me inside. "Your arm is broken," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, "Tell me exactly how it happened--what</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told him what I had seen; told him in broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentences, with gasps of pain between them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">very dexterously and swiftly he bound my arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">meanwhile. He slung it from my shoulder, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and looked at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll do," he said. "And now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought. Then he went out and locked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gates of the enclosure. He was absent some time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was chiefly concerned about my arm. The in*</seg><seg type="columnLine">cident seemed merely one more of many horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. I sat down in the deck chair, and I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit swore heartily at the island. The first dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of injury in my arm had already given way</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISL'AND OF DR'. MOREAU</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">713</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to a burning pain when Montgomery reappeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His face was rather pale, and he showed more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lower gums than ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can neither see nor hear anything of him," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I've been thinking .he may want my help."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stared at me with his expressionless eyes. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a strong brute," he said. "It simply wrenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">its fetter out of the wall." He went to the window,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then to the door, and there turned to me. "I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">go after him," he said. "There's another revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can leave with you. To tell you the truth, I feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious somehow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He obtained the weapon, and put it ready to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand on the table; then went out, leaving a restless</seg><seg type="columnLine">contagion in the air. I did not sit long after he</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, but took the revolver in hand and went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning was as still as death. Not a whisper</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wind was stirring; the sea was like polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass, the sky empty, the beach desolate. In my</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-excited, half-feverish state, this stillness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things oppressed me. I tried to whistle, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune died away. I swore again,--the second time</seg><seg type="columnLine">that morning. Then I went to the corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosure and stared inland at the green bush that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had swallowed up Moreau and Montgomery. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">would they return, and how? Then far away up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach a little grey Beast Man appeared, ran down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the water's edge and began splashing about. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">strolled back to the doorway, then to the corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and so began pacing to and fro like a sentinel</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon duty. Once I was arrested by the distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice of Montgomery bawling, "Coo-ee-- Mor-eau!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">My arm became less painful, but very hot. I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">feverish and thirsty. My shadow grew shorter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I watched the distant figure until it went away</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Would Moreau and Montgomery never re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn? Three sea-birds began fighting for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranded treasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then from far away behind the enclosure I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pistol-shot. A long silence, and then came an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. Then a yelling cry nearer, and another dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal gap of silence. My unfortunate imagination set</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work to torment me. Then suddenly a shot close</seg><seg type="columnLine">by. I went to the corner, startled, and saw Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gomery,--his face scarlet, his hair disordered, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knee of his trousers torn. His face expressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">profound consternation. Behind him slouched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beast Man, M'ling, and round M'ling's jaws were</seg><seg type="columnLine">some queer dark stains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Has he come?" said Montgomery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Moreau?" said I. "No."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" The man was panting, almost sobbing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Go back in," he said, taking my arm. "They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad. They're all rushing about mad. What can</seg><seg type="columnLine">have happened? I don't know. I'll tell you, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">my breath comes. Where's some brandy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Montgomery limped before me into the room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down in the deck chair. M'ling flung himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">down just outside the doorway and began panting</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a dog. I got Montgomery some brandy-and-</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. He sat staring in front of him at nothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovering his breath. After some minutes he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to tell me what had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had followed their track for some way. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was plain enough at first on account of the crushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and broken bushes, white rags torn from the puma's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bandages, and occasional smears of blood on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves of the shrubs and undergrowth. He lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">the track, however, on the stony ground beyond tho</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream where I had seen the Beast Man drinking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went wandering aimlessly westward shouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreau's name. Then M'ling had come to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying a light hatchet. M'ling had seen nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the puma affair; had been felling wood, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard him calling. They went on shouting together*</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two Beast Men came crouching and peering at them</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the undergrowth, with gestures and a fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive carriage that alarmed Montgomery by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangeness. He hailed them, and they fled guiltily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stopped shouting after that and after wander-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing some time farther in an undecided way, deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined to visit the huts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found the ravine deserted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Growing more alarmed every minute, he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to retrace his steps. Then it was he encountered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two Swine-rmen I had seen dancing on the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my arrival; bloodstained they were about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, and intensely excited. They came crashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the ferns, and stopped with fierce faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they saw him. He cracked his whip in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">trepidation, and forthwith they rushed at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Never before had a Beast Man dared to do that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One he shot through the head; M'ling flung himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the other, and the two rolled grappling. M'ling</seg><seg type="columnLine">got his brute under and with his teeth in its throat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Montgomery shot that too as it struggled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">M'ling's grip. He had some difficulty in inducing</seg><seg type="columnLine">M'ling to come on with him. Thence they had hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried back to me. On the way, M'ling had suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed into a thicket and driven out an undersized</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackal-man, also blood-stained, and lame through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wound in the foot. This brute had run a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">way and then turned savgely at bay, and Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gomery--with a certain wantonness, I thought--«</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shot him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does it all mean?" said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook his head, and turned once more to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brandy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Finding of Moreau</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN I saw Montgomery swallow a third</seg><seg type="columnLine">dose of brandy, I took it upon myself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">interfere. He was already more than half</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuddled. I told him that some serious thing must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have happened to Moreau by this time, or he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have returned before this, and that it behooved us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascertain what that catastrophe was. Montgomery</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised some feeble objections, and at last agreed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had some food, and then all three of us started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is possibly due to the tension of my mind at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time, but even now that start into the hot still-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the tropical afternoon is a singularly vivid</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression. M'ling went first, his shoulder hunched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his strange black head moving with quick starts as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he peered first on this side of the way and then on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. He was unarmed; his axe he had dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he encountered the Swine-man, Teeth were</seg><seg type="columnLine">his weapons, when it came to fighting. Montgomery</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed with stumbling footsteps, his hands in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets, his face downcast; he was in a state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">muddled sullenness with me on account of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">714</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brandy. My left arm was in a sling (it was lucky</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was my left), and I carried my revolver in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. Soon we traced a narrow path through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild luxuriance of the island, going northwestward;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and presently M'ling stopped, and became rigid</seg><seg type="columnLine">with watchfulness. Montgomery almost staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">into him, and then stopped too. Then, listening in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tently, we heard coming through the trees the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of voices and footsteps approaching us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is dead," said a deep, vibrating voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is not dead; he is not dead," jabbered an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We saw, we saw," said several voices.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "HvJAo" suddenly shouted Montgomery, "Ilul-lo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Confound you!" said I, and gripped my pistol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a silence, then a crashing among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interlacing vegetation, first here, then there, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then half-a-dozen faces appeared,--strange faces, lit</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a strange light. M'ling made a growling noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his throat. I recognised the Ape-man: I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed already identified his voice, and two of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-swathed brown-featured creatures I had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Montgomery's boat. With these were the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">dappled brutes and that grey, horribly crooked crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture who said the Law, with grey hair streaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">down its cheeks, heavy grey eyebrows, and grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">locks pouring off from a central parting upon its</seg><seg type="columnLine">sloping forehead,--a heavy, faceless thing, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange red eyes, looking at us curiously from</seg><seg type="columnLine">amidst the green.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a space no one spoke. Then Montgomery</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiccoughed, "Who--said he was dead?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Monkey-man looked guiltily at the hair-grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thing. "He is dead," said this monster. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was nothing threatening about this detach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, at any rate. They seemed awe-stricken and</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is he?" said Montgomery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beyond," and the grey creature pointed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is there a Law now?" asked the Monkey-mari.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Is it still to be this and that? Is he dead indeed?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is there a Law?" repeated the man in white.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Is there a Law, thou Other with the Whip?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is dead," said the hairy-grey Thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And they all stood watching us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Prendick," said Montgomery, turning his dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes to me. "He's dead, evidently."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had been standing behind him during this</seg><seg type="columnLine">colloquy. I began to see how things lay with them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I suddenly stopped in front of Montgomery and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted up my voice:--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Children of the Law," I said, "he is not dead!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">M'ling turned his sharp eyes on me. "He has</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed his shape; he has changed his body," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on. "For a time you will not see him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">is--there," I pointed upward, "where he can watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. You cannot see him, but he can see you. Fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Law!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked at them squarely. They flinched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is great, he is good," said the Ape-man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">peering fearfully upward among the dense trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the other Thing?" I demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Thing that bled, and ran screaming and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbing,--that is dead too," said the grey Thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still regarding me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's well," grunted Montgomery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Other with the Whip--" began the grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Said he was dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Montgomery was still sober enough to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand my motive in denying Moreau's death. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not dead," he said slowly, "not dead at all. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">more dead than I am."	i</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some," said I, "have broken the Law: they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">die. Some have died. Show us now where his old</seg><seg type="columnLine">body lies,--the body he cast away because he had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more need of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is this way, Man who walked in the Sea,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the grey Thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And with these six creatures guiding us, we went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the tumult of ferns and creepers and tree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stems towards the northwest. Then came a yelling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crashing among the branches, and a little pink</seg><seg type="columnLine">homunculus rushed by us shrieking. Immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">after appeared a feral monster in headlong pursuit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-bedabbled, who was amongst us almost before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could stop his career. The grey Thing leapt</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside. M'ling, with a snarl, flew at it, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck aside. Montgomery fired and missed, bowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head, threw up his arm, and turned to run. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired, and the Thing still came on; fired again, point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank, into its ugly face. I saw its features vanish</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a flash: its face was driven in. Yet it passed me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped Montgomery, and holding him, fell head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">long beside him and pulled him sprawling upon it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in its death-agony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I found myself alone with M'ling, the dead brute,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-the prostrate man. Montgomery raised himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly and stared in a muddled way at the shattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beast Man beside him. It more than half sobered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He scrambled to his feet. Then I saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grey Thing returning cautiously through the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See," said I, pointing to the dead brute, "is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Law not alive ? This came of breaking the Law."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He peered at the body. "He sends the Fire that</seg><seg type="columnLine">kills," said he, in his deep voice, repeating part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ritual. The others gathered round and stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last we drew near the westward extremity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island. We came upon the gnawed and mutilated</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of the puma, its shoulder-bone smashed by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet, and perhaps twenty yards farther found at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last what we sought. Moreau lay face downward in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trampled space in a canebrake. One hand was&gt;</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost severed at the wrist, and his silvery hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dabbled in blood. His head had been battered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in by the fetters of the puma. The broken canes</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath him were smeared with blood. His revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could not find. Montgomery turned him over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Resting at intervals, and with the help of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven Beast People (for he was a heavy man), we</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried Moreau back to the enclosure. The night</seg><seg type="columnLine">was darkling. Twice we heard unseen creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">howling and shrieking past our little band, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">once the little pink sloth-creature appeared and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at us, and vanished again. But we were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacked again. At the gates of the enclosure our</seg><seg type="columnLine">company of Beast People left us, M'ling going with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest. We locked ourself in, and then took</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreau's mangled body into the yard and laid it</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a pile of brushwood. Then we went into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">715</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory and put an end to all we found living</seg><seg type="columnLine">there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIX</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montgomery's "Bank Holiday"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN this was accomplished, and we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed and eaten, Montgomery and I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">into my little room and seriously discussed</seg><seg type="columnLine">our position for the first time. It was then near</seg><seg type="columnLine">midnight. He was almost sober, but greatly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed in his mind. He had been strangely under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the influence of Moreau's personality: I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it had ever occurred to him that Moreau could</seg><seg type="columnLine">die. This disaster was the sudden collapse of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">habits that had become part of his nature in the ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">or more monotonous years he had spent on the is-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. He talked vaguely, answered my questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">crookedly, wandered into general questions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This silly ass of a world," he said; "what a</seg><seg type="columnLine">muddle it all is! I haven't had any life. I wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it's going to begin. Sixteen years being bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lied by nurses and schoolmasters at their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet will; five in London grinding hard at med-</seg><seg type="columnLine">icine, bad food, shabby lodgings, shabby clothes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shabby vice, a blunder,--I didn't know any better,</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and hustled off to this beastly island. Ten years</seg><seg type="columnLine">here! What's it all for, Prendick? Are we bubbles</seg><seg type="columnLine">blown by a baby?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was hard to deal with such ravings. "The thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have to think of now," said I, "is how to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from this island."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the good of getting away? I'm an out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast. Where am I to join on? It's all very well</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you, Prendick. Poor old Moreau! We can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave him here to have his bones picked. As it is--</seg><seg type="columnLine">And besides, what will become of the decent part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Beast Folk?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said I, "that will'do to-morrow. I've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking we might make that brush-wood into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pyre and burn his body--and those other things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then what will happen with the Beast Folk?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "7 don't know. I suppose those that were made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of beasts of prey will make silly asses of them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves sooner or later. We can't massacre the lot--•</seg><seg type="columnLine">can we? I suppose that's what your humanity</seg><seg type="columnLine">would suggest? But they'll change. They are sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">to change."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He talked thus inconclusively until at last I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">my temper going.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damnation!" he exclaimed at some petulance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine; "can't you see I'm in a worse hole than you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are?" And he got up, and went for the brandy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Drink!" he said returning, "you logic-chopping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chalky-faced saint of an atheist, drink!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not I," said I, and sat grimly watching his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the yellow paraffin flare, as he drank himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a garrulous misery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have a memory of infinite tedium. He wandered</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a maudlin defence of the Beast People and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">M'ling. M'ling, he said, was the only thing that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever really cared for him. And suddenly an idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm damned!" said he, staggering to his feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutching the brandy bottle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By some flash of intuition I knew what it was he</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended. "You don't give drink to that beast!" I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">said, rising and facing him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beast!" said he. "You're the beast. He takes</seg><seg type="columnLine">his liquor like a Christian.

We're on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of things. I'm bound to cut my throat to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow. I'm going to have a damned Bank Holiday</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-night." He turned and went out into the moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. "M'ling!" he cried; "M'ling, old friend!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three dim creatures in the silvery light came</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the edge of the wan beach,--one a white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped creature, the other two blotches of black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness following it. They halted, staring. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw M'ling's hunched shoulders as he came round</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner of the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Drink!" cried Montgomery, "drink, you brutes!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drink and be men! Damme, I'm the cleverest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreau forgot this; this is the last touch. Drink,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tell you!" And waving the bottle in his hand he</seg><seg type="columnLine">started off at a kind of quick trot to the westward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">M'ling ranging himself between him and the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim creatures who followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went to the doorway. They were already in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct in the mist of the moonlight before Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gomery halted. I saw him administer a dose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raw brandy to M'ling, and saw the five figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">melt into one vague patch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sing!" I heard Montgomery shout,--"sing all</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, 'Confound olds Prendick!' That's right;</seg><seg type="columnLine">now again, 'Confound old Prendick!'"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black group broke up into five separate fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures, and wound slowly away from me along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">band of shining beach. Each went howling at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own sweet will, yelping insults at me, or giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever other vent this new inspiration of brandy</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded. Presently I heard Montgomery's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting, "Right turn!" and they passed w'ith their</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouts and howls into the blackness of the landward</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees. Slowly, very slowly, they receded into silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The peaceful splendour of the night healed again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The moon was now past the meridian and travelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the west. It was at its full, and very bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding through the empty dark sky. The shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wall lay, a yard wide and of inky blackness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my feet. The eastward sea was a featureless</seg><seg type="columnLine">grey, dark and mysterious; and between the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the shadow the grey sands (of volcanic glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crystals) flashed and shone like a beach of dia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monds. Behind me the paraffin lamp flared hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ruddy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I shut the door, locked it, and went into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enclosure where Moreau lay beside his latest</seg><seg type="columnLine">victims,--the staghounds and the llama and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">other wretched brutes,--with his massive face calm</seg><seg type="columnLine">716</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">even after his terrible death, and with the hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes open, staring at the dead white moon above.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sat down upon the edge of the sink, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes upon that ghastly pile of silvery light and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ominous shadows began to turn over my plans. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning I would gather some provisions in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dingey, and after setting fire to the pyre before me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">push out into the desolation of the high sea once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. I felt that for Montgomery there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">help; that he was, in truth, half akin to these</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beast Folk, unfitted for human kindred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I do not know how long I sat there scheming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It must have been an hour or so. Then my plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning was interrupted by the return of Montgomery</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my neighbourhood. I heard a yelling from many</seg><seg type="columnLine">throats, a tumult of exultant cries passing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the beach, whooping and howling, and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cited shrieks that seemed to come to a stop near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water's edge. The riot rose and fell; I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy blows and the splintering smash of wood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it did not trouble me then. A discordant chant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My thoughts went back to my means of escape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got up, brought the lamp, and went into a shed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look at some kegs I had seen there. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">became interested in the contents of some biscuit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tins, and opened one. I saw something out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail of my eye,--a red figure,--and turned sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind me lay the yard, vividly black-and-white</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the moonlight, and the pile of wood and faggots</seg><seg type="columnLine">on which Moreau and his mutilated victims lay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one over another. They seemed to be gripping one</seg><seg type="columnLine">another in one last revengeful grapple. His-wounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaped, black as night, and the blood that had drip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped lay in black patches upon the sand. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw, without understanding, the cause of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">phantom,--a ruddy glow that came and danced and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went upon the wall opposite. I misinterpreted this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancied it was a reflection of my flickering lamp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned again to the stores in the shed. I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on rummaging among them, as well as a one-armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">man could, finding this convenient thing and that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and putting them aside for to-morrow's launch. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements were slow, and the time passed quickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Insensibly the daylight crept upon me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chanting died down, giving place to a clam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">our; then it began again, and suddenly broke into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tumult. I heard cries of "More! more!" a sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">like quarrelling, and a sudden wild shriek. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality of the sounds changed so greatly that it ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested my attention. I went out into the yard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened. Then cutting like a knife across the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion came the crack of a revolver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I rushed at once through my room to the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway. As I did so I heard some of the packing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases behind me go sliding down and smash to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether with a clatter of glass on the floor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed. But I did not heed these. I flung the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">open and looked out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up the beach by the boathouse a bonfire was</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning, raining up sparks into the indistinctness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dawn. Around this struggled a mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">black figures. I heard Montgomery call my name.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began to run at once towards this fire, revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hand. I saw the pink tongue of Montgomery's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol lick out out once, close to the ground. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was down. I shouted with all my strength and fired</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air. I heard some one cry, "The Master!".</seg><seg type="columnLine">The knotted black struggle broke into scattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">units, the fire leapt and sank down. The crowd of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beast People fled in sudden panic before me, up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beach. In my excitement I fired at their retreat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing backs as they disappeared among the bushes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I turned to the black heaps upon the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Montgomery lay on his back, with the hairy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grey" Beast-man sprawling across his body. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute was dead, but still gripping Montgomery's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat with its curving claws. Near by lay M'ling</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his face and quite still, his neck bitten open and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper part of the smashed brandy-bottle in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. Two other figures lay near the fire,--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one motionless, the other groaning fitfully, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then raising its head slowly, then dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">it again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I caught hold of the grey man and pulled him off</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montgomery's body; his claws drew down the torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat reluctantly as I dragged him away. Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gomery was dark in the face and scarcely breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I splashed sea-water on his face and pillow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed his head on my rolled-up coat. M'ling was dead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wounded creature by the fire--it was a Wolf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute with a bearded grey face--lay, I found, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fore part of its body upon the still glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">timber. The wretched thing was injured so dread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully that in mercy I blew its brains out at once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other brute was one of the Bull-men swathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in white. He too was dead. The rest of the Beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">People had vanished from the beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went to Montgomery again and knelt beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, cursing my ignorance of medicine. The fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside me had sunk down, and only charred beams</seg><seg type="columnLine">of timber glowing at the central ends and mixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a grey ash of brushwood remained. I won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered casually where Montgomery had got his wood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I saw that the dawn was upon us. The sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">had grown brighter, the setting moon was becom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing pale and opaque in the luminous blue of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. The sky to the eastward was rimmed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">, Suddenly I heard a thud and a hissing behind me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, looking round, sprang to my feet with a cry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror. Against the warm dawn great tumultuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses of black smoke were boiling up out of the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closure, and through their stormy darkness shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickering threads of blood-red flame. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thatched roof caught. I saw the curving charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flames across the sloping straw. A spurt of fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">jetted from the window of my room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knew at once what had happened. I remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crash I had heard. When I had rushed out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montgomery's assistance, I had overturned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hopelessness of saving any of the contents of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enclosure stared me in the face. My mind came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to my plan of flight, and turning swiftly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked to see where the two boats lay upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach. They were gone! Two axes lay upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands beside me; chips and splinters were scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadcast, and the ashes of the bonfire were black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening and smoking under the dawn. Montgomery</seg><seg type="columnLine">had burnt the boats to revenge himself upon me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and prevent our return to mankind!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden convulsion of rage shook me. I wag</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost moved to batter his foolish head in, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">717</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lay there at my feet. Then suddenly his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved, so feebly, so pitifully, that my wrath van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished. He groaned, and opened his eyes for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute. I knelt down beside him and raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. He opened his eyes again, staring silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the dawn, and then they met mine. The lids</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorry," he said presently, with an effort. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed trying to think. "The last," he murmured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"the last of this silly universe. What a mess--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I listened. His head fell helplessly to one side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought some drink might revive him; but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">■was neither drink nor vessel in which to bring drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">at hand. He seemed suddenly heavier. My heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">went cold. I bent down to his face, put my hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the rent in his blouse. He was dead;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even as he died a line of white heat, the limb</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun, rose eastward beyond the projection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bay, splashing its radiance across the sky and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning the dark sea into a weltering tumult of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazzling light. It fell like a glory upon his death-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrunken face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I let his head fall gently upon the rough pillow</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had made for him, and stood up. Before me was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glittering desolation of the sea, the awful soli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude from which I had already suffered so much;</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind me the island, hushed under the dawn, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beast People silent and unseen. The enclosure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all its provisions and ammunition, burnt noisi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, with sudden gusts of flame, a fitful crackling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now and then a crash. The heavy smoke drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the beach away from me, rolling low over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant tree-tops towards the huts in the ravine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beside me were the charred vestiges of the boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">and these four dead bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then out of the bushes came three Beast People,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hunched shoulders, protruding heads, mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapen hands awkwardly held, and inquisitive, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly eyes, and advanced towards me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitating gestures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XX</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alone with the Beast Folk</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 FACED these people, facing my fate in them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">single-handed now,--literally single-handed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I had a broken arm. In my pocket was a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver with two empty chambers. Among the chips</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered about the beach lay the two axes that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been used to chop up the boats. The tide was creep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in behind me. There was nothing for it but</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage. I looked squarely into the faces of the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vancing monsters. They avoided my eyes, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">quivering nostrils investigated the bodies that lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond me on the beach. I took half-a-dozen steps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up the blood-stained whip that lay beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body of the Wolf-man, and cracked it. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped and stared at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Salute!" said I. "Bow down!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They hesitated. One bent his knees. I repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">my command, with my heart in my mouth, and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced upon them. One knelt, then the other two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned and walked towards the dead bodies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping my face towards the three kneeling Beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men, very much as an actor passing up the stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces the audience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They broke the Law," said I, putting my foot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Sayer of the Law. "They have been slain,--</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the Sayer of the Law; even the Other with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Whip. Great is the Law! Come and see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None escape," said one of them, advancing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None escape," said I. "Therefore hear and do</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I command." They stood up, looking question-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly at one another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand there," said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I picked up the hatchets and swung them by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads from the sling of my arm; turned Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gomery over; picked up his revolver still loaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in two chambers, and bending down to rummage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">found half-dozen cartridges in his pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take him," said I, standing up again and point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with the whip; "take him, and carry him out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cast him into the sea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They came forward, evidently still afraid of Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gomery, but still more afraid of my cracking red</seg><seg type="columnLine">whip-lash; and after some fumbling and hesitation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some whip-cracking and shouting, they lifted him</seg><seg type="columnLine">gingerly, carried him down to the beach, and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashing into the dazzling welter of the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On!" said I, "on; Carry him far."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went in up to their armpits and stood re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garding me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let go," said I; and the body of Montgomery</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished with a splash. Something seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tighten across my chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good!" said I, with a break in my voice; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came back, hurrying and fearful, to the mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gin of the water, leaving long wakes of black in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silver. At the water's edge they stopped, turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and glaring into the sea as though they pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently expected Montgomery to arise therefrom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">exact vengeance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now these," said I, pointing to the other bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They took care not to approach the place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had thrown Montgomery into the water, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead, carried the four dead Beast People slant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly along the beach for perhaps a hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they waded out and cast them away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I watched them disposing of the mangled re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mains of M'ling, I heard a light footfall behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and turning quickly saw the big Hyena-swine</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps a dozen yards away. His head was bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, his bright eyes were fixed upon me, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumpy hands clenched and held close by his side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stopped in his crouching attitude when I turned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes a little averted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment we stood eye to eye. I dropped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whip and snatched at the pistol in my pocket; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">I meant to kill this brute, the most formidable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any left now upon the island, at the first excuse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It may seem treacherous, hut so I was resolved. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far more afraid of him than of any other two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Beast Folk. His continued life was I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">a threat against mine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was perhaps a dozen seconds collecting myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then cried I, "Salute! Bow down!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His teeth flashed upon me in a snarl. "Who are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you that I should--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps a little too spasmodically I drew my</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver, aimed quickly and fired. I heard him</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelp, saw him run sideways and turn, knew I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed, and clicked back the cock with my thumb</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the next shot. But he was already running</seg><seg type="columnLine">718</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">headlong, jumping from side to side, and I dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">not risk another miss. Every now and then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked back at me over his shoulder. He went</seg><seg type="columnLine">slanting along the beach, and vanished beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving masses of dense smoke that were still pour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out from the burning enclosure. For some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stood staring after him. I turned to my three</seg><seg type="columnLine">obedient Beast Folk again and signalled them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop the body they still carried. Then I went back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the place by the fire where the bodies had fallen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kicked the sand until all the brown blood-stains</seg><seg type="columnLine">were absorbed and hidden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I dismissed my three serfs with a wave of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and went up the beach into the thickets. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried my pistol in my hand, my whip thrust with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hatchets in the sling of my arm. I was anxious</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be alone, to think out the position in which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now placed. A dreadful thing that I was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to realise was, that over all this island</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was now no safe place where I could be alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and secure to rest or sleep. I had recovered strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazingly since my landing, but I was still inclined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be nervous and to break down under any great</seg><seg type="columnLine">stress. I felt that I ought to cross the island and</seg><seg type="columnLine">establish myself with the Beast People, and make</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself secure in their confidence. But my heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed me. I went back to the beach, and turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastward past the burning enclosure, made for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">point where a shallow spit of coral sand ran out</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the reef. Here I could sit down and think,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my back to the sea and my face against any sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise. And there I sat, chin on knees, the sun beat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down upon my head and unspeakable dread in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind, plotting how I could live on against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour of my rescue (if ever rescue came). I tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">review the whole situation as clamly as I could,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was difficult to clear the thing of emotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I began turning over in my mind the reason of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montgomery's despair. "They will change," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said; "they are sure to change." And Moreau,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was it that Moreau had said? "The stubborn</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast-flesh grows day by day back again." Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I came round to the Hyena-swine. I felt sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I did not kill that brute, he would kill me. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sayer of the Law was dead: worse luck. They knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">now that we of the Whips could be killed even as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they themselves were killed. Were they peering</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me already out of the green masses of ferns and</seg><seg type="columnLine">palms over yonder, watching until I came within</seg><seg type="columnLine">their spring? Were they plotting against me?</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was the Hyena-swine telling them? My</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination was running away with me into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">morass of unsubstantial fears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My thoughts were disturbed by a crying of sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds hurrying towards some black object that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been stranded by the waves on the beach near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosure. I knew what that object was, but I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the heart to go back and drive them off.- I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan walking along the beach in the opposite direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, designing to come round the eastward corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the island and so approach the ravine of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huts, without traversing the possible ambuscades</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the thickets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps half a mile along the beach I became</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of one of my three Beast Folk advancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the landward bushes towards me. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now so nervous with my own imaginings that I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately drew my revolver. Even the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitiatory gestures of the creature failed to disarm</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. He hesitated as he approached.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go away!" cried I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was something very suggestive of a dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cringing attitude of the creature. It re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated a little way, very like a dog being sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, and stopped, looking at me imploringly with</seg><seg type="columnLine">canine brown eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go away," said I. "Do not come near me,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May I not come near you?" it said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nof; go away," I insisted, and snapped my</seg><seg type="columnLine">whip. Then putting my whip in my teeth, I stoop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed for a stone, and with that threat drove the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So in solitude I came round by the ravine of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beast People, and hiding among the weeds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeds that separated this crevice from the sea I</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched such of them as appeared, trying to judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their gestures and appearance how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">death of Moreau and Montgomery and the destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the House of Pain had affected them. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know now the folly of my cowardice. Had I kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">my courage up to the l&lt;?vel of the dawn, had I</seg><seg type="columnLine">not allowed it to ebb away in solitary thought, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have grasped the vacant sceptre of Moreau</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ruled over the Beast People. As it was I lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opportunity, and sank to the position of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere leader among my fellows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Towards noon certain of them came and squat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted basking in the hot sand. The imperious voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hunger and thirst prevailed over my dread. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out of the bushes, and, revolver in hand,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked down towards these seated figures. One,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Wolf-woman, turned her head and stared at me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then the others. None attempted to rise or</seg><seg type="columnLine">salute me. I felt too faint and weary to insist, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I let the moment pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want food," said I, almost apologetically, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing near.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is food in the huts," said an Ox-boar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, drowsily, and looking away from me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I passed them, and went down into the shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and odours of the almost deserted ravine. In an</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty hut I feasted on some specked and half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">decayed fruit; and then after I had propped some</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches and sticks about the opening, and placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself with my face towards it and my hand up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my revolver, the exhaustion of the last thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours claimed its own, and I fell into a light</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumber, hoping that the flimsy barricade I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">erected v/ould cause sufficient noise in its removal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to save me from surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Reversion of the Beast FolK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN this way I became one among the Beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">People in the Island of Doctor Moreau. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">I awoke, it was dark about me. My arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">ached in its bandages. I sat up, wondering at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I might be. I heard coarse voices talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside. Then I saw that my barricade had gone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the opening of the hut stood clear. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver was still in my hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard something breathing, saw something</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched together close beside me. I held my</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">719</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">breath, trying to see what it was. It began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move slowly, interminably. Then something soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">and warm and moist passed across my hand. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">my muscles contracted. I snatched my hand away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A cry of alarm began and was stifled in ray throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I just realised what had happened sufficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stay my fingers on the revolver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who is that?" I said in a horse whisper, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver still pointed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--Master."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They say there is no Master now. But I know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know. I carried the bodies into the sea, 0</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walker in the Sea! the bodies of those you slew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am your slave, Master."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you the one I met on the beach?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The same, Master."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Thing was evidently faithful enough, for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have fallen upon me as I slept. "It is well,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said, extending my hand for another licking kiss.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began to realise what its presence meant, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tide of my courage flowed. "Where are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are mad; they are fools," said the Dog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. "Even now they talk together beyond there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They say, 'The Master is dead. The Other with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whip is dead. That Other who walked in the Sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">is as we are. We have no Master, no Whips, no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">House of Pain, any more. There is an end. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">love the Law, and will keep it; but there is no Pain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no Master, no Whips for ever again.' So they say.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I know, Master, I know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt in the darkness, and patted the Dog-man'S</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. "It is well," I said again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Presently you will slay them all," said the Dog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Presently," I answered, "I will slay them all,--</seg><seg type="columnLine">after certain days and certain things have come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pass. Every one of them save those you spare,</seg><seg type="columnLine">every one of them shall be slain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the Master wishes to kill, the Master</seg><seg type="columnLine">kills," said the Dog-man with a certain satisfaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that their sins may grow," I said, "let</seg><seg type="columnLine">them live in their folly until their time is ripe. Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">them not know that I am the Master."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Master's will is sweet," said the Dog-man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the ready tact of his canine blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But one has sinned," said I. "Him I will kill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whenever I may meet him. When I say to you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'That is he,' see that you fall upon him. And now</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will go to the men and women who are assembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">together."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment the opening of the hut was black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened by the exit of the Dog-man. Then I followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stood up, almost in the exact spot where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been when I had heard Moreau and his stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hound pursuing me. But now it was night, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the miasmatic ravine about me was black; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond, instead of a green, sunlit slope, I saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">red fire, before which hunched, grotesque figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved to and fro. Farther were the thick trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bank of darkness, fringed above with the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">lace of the upper branches. The moon was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding up on the edge of the ravine, and like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar across its face drove the spire of vapour that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was for ever streaming from the fumaroles of tho</seg><seg type="columnLine">island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Walk by me," said I, nerving myself; and side</seg><seg type="columnLine">by side we walked down the narrow way, taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">little heed of the dim Things that peered at us out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the huts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> None about the fire attempted to salute me. Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them disregarded me, ostentatiously. I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">round for the Hyena-swine, but he was not there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Altogether, perhaps twenty of the Beast Folk squat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted, staring into the fire or talking to one another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is dead, he is dead! the Master is dead!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the voice of the Ape-man to the right of me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The House of Pain--there is no House of Pain!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is not dead," said I, in a loud voice.' "Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">now he watches us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This startled them. Twenty pairs of eyes re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garded me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The House of Pain is gone," said I. "It will</seg><seg type="columnLine">come again. The Master you cannot see; yet even</seg><seg type="columnLine">now he listens among you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True, true!" said the Dog-man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were staggered at my assurance. An ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal may be ferocious and cunning enough, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes a real man to tell a lie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Man with tlie Bandaged Arm speaks a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange thing," said one of the Beast Folk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I tell you it is so," I said. "The Master and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">House of Pain will come again. Woe be to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">who breaks the Law!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They looked curiously at one another. With an</seg><seg type="columnLine">affectation of indifference I began to chop idly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground in front of me with my hatchet. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked, I noticed, at the deep cuts I made in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">turf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the Satyr raised a doubt. I answered him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then one of the dappled things objected, and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">animated discussion sprang up round the fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every moment I began to feel more convinced of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my present security. I talked now without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">catching in my breath, due to the intensity of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement, that had troubled me at first. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">course of about an hour I had really convinced sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral of the Beast Folk of the truth of my asser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, and talked most of the others into a dubious</seg><seg type="columnLine">state. I kept a sharp eye for my enemy the Hyena-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swine, but he never appeared. Every now and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a suspicious movement would startle me, but my</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence grew rapidly. Then as the moon crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from the zenith, one by one the listeners be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to yaw (showing the oddest teeth in the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sinldng fire), and first one and then another</seg><seg type="columnLine">retired towards the dens in the ravine; and I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreading the silence and darkness, went with them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing I was safer with several of them than</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this manner began the longer part of my so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">journ upon this Island of Doctor Moreau. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that night until the end came, there was but</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing happened to tell save a series of innumer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able small unpleasant details and the fretting of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">incessant-uneasiness. So that I prefer to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">no chronicle for that gap of time, to tell only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">cardinal incident of the ten months I spent as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">intimate of these half-humanized brutes. There is</seg><seg type="columnLine">much that sticks in my memory that I could write,</seg><seg type="columnLine">--things that I would cheerfully give my right</seg><seg type="columnLine">720</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to forget; but they do not help the telling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the retrospect it is strange to remember how</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon I fell in with these monsters' ways, and gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">my confidence again. I had my quarrels with them</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, and could show some of their teeth-mark3</seg><seg type="columnLine">still; but they soon gained a wholesome respect for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my trick of throwing stones and for the bite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hatchet. And my Saint-Bernard-man's loyalty</seg><seg type="columnLine">was of infinite service to me. I found their simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">scale of honour was based mainly on the capacity</seg><seg type="columnLine">for inflicting trenchant wounds. Indeed, I may</seg><seg type="columnLine">say--without vanity, I hope--that I held something</seg><seg type="columnLine">like pre-eminence among them. One or two, whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a rare access of high spirits I had scarred rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly, bore me a grudge; but it vented itself chiefly</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind my back, and at a safe distance from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">missiles, in grimaces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Hyena-swine avoided me, and I was always</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the alert for him. My inseparable Dog-man hated</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dreaded him intensely. I really believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at the root of the brute's attachment to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was soon evident to me that the former monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tasted blood, and gone the way of the Leopard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. He formed a lair somewhere in the forest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and became solitary. Once I tried to induce the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beast Folk to hunt him, but I lacked the authority</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make them co-operate for one end. Again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again I tried to approach his den and come upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him unaware; but always he was too acute for me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw 01* winded me and got away. He too made</seg><seg type="columnLine">-every forest pathway dangerous to me and my ally</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his lurking ambuscades. The Dog-man scarce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly dared to leave my side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the first month or so the Beast Folk, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared with their latter condition, were human</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, and for one 01* two besides my canine friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">I even conceived a friendly tolerance. The little</seg><seg type="columnLine">pink sloth-creature displayed an odd affection for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and took to following me about. The Monkey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man bored^ me, however; he assumed, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength of his five digits, that he was my equal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was forever jabbering at me,--jabbering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most arrant nonsense. One thing about him enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained me a little: he had a fantastic trick of</seg><seg type="columnLine">coining new words. He had an idea, I believe, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gabble about names that meant nothing was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper use of speech. He called it "Big Thinks"</seg><seg type="columnLine">to distinguish it from "Little Thinks," the sane</seg><seg type="columnLine">every-day interests of life. If ever I made a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark he did not understand, he would praise it very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much, ask me to say it again, learn it by heart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and go off repeating it, with a word wrong here or</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, to all the milder of the Beast People. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought nothing of what was plain and comprehen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible. I invented some very curious "Big Thinks"</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his especial use. I believe now that he was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silliest creature I never met; he had developed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most wonderful way the distinctive silliness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">man without losing one jot of the natural folly</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a monkey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This, I say, was in the earlier weeks of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">solitude among these brutes. During that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">they respected the usage established by the Law,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and behaved with general decorum. Once I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">another rabbit torn to pieces,--by the Hyena-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swine, I am assured,--but that was all. It was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> about May when I first distinctly perceived a grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing difference in their speech and carriage, a grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing coarseness of articulation, a growing disinclina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to talk. My Monkey-man's jabber multiplied</seg><seg type="columnLine">in volume, but grew less and less comprehensible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and more simian. Some of the others seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether slipping their hold upon speech, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they still understood what I said to them at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. (Can you imagine language, once clear-cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">and exact, softening and guttering, losing shape and</seg><seg type="columnLine">import, becoming mere lumps of sound again?)</seg><seg type="columnLine">And they walked erect with an increasing difficulty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though they evidently felt ashamed of themselves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">every now and then I would come upon one or</seg><seg type="columnLine">another running on toes and finger-tips, and quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to recover the vertical attitude. They held</seg><seg type="columnLine">things more clumsily; drinking by suction, feeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">by gnawing, grew commoner every day. I realised</seg><seg type="columnLine">more keenly than ever what Moreau had told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the "stubborn beast-flesh." They were re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verting, and reverting very rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My Dog-man imperceptibly slipped back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog again; day by day he became dumb, quad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupedal, hairy. I scarcely noticed the transition</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the companion on my right hand to the lurch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing dog at my side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the carelessness and disorganisation increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">from day to day, the lane of dwelling-places, at no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time very sweet, became so loathsome that I left</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and going across the island made myself a hovel</seg><seg type="columnLine">of boughs amid the black ruins of Moreau's en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closure. Some memory of pain, I found, still made</seg><seg type="columnLine">that place the safest from the Beast Folk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would be impossible to detail every step of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapsing of these monsters,--to tell how, day by</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, the human semblance left them; how they</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave up bandagings and wrappings, abandoned at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last every stitch of clothing; how the hair began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to spread over the exposed limbs; how their fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads fell away and their faces projected; how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quasi-human intimacy I had permitted myself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of them in the first month of my loneliness</seg><seg type="columnLine">became a shuddering horror to recall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The change was slow and inevitable. For them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for me it came without any definite shock. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">still went among them in safety, because no jolt</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the downward glide had released the increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of explosive animalism that ousted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human day by day. But I began to fear that soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">now that shock must come. My Saint-Bernard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute followed me to the enclosure every night, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his vigilance enabled me to sleep at times in some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like peace. The little pink sloth-thing became</seg><seg type="columnLine">shy and left me, to crawl back to its natural life</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more among the tree-branches. We were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">just the state of equilibrium that would remain in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of those "Happy Family" cages which animal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tamers exhibit, if the tamer were to leave it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course these creatures did not decline into</seg><seg type="columnLine">such beasts as the reader has seen in zoological</seg><seg type="columnLine">gardens,--into ordinary bears, wolves, tigers, oxen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swine, and apes. There was still something strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">about each; in each Moreau had blended this animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that. One perhaps was ursine chiefly; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">each was tainted with other creatures,--a kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">generalised animalism appearing through tho</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">721</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> specific dispositions. And the dwindling shreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the humanity still startled me every now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then,--a momentary recrudescence of speech per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps, an unexpected dexterity of the fore-feet, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitiful attempt to walk erect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I too must have undergone strange changes. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes hung about me as yellow rags, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose rents showed the tanned skin. My hair grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, and became matted together. I am told that</seg><seg type="columnLine">even now my eyes have a strange brightness, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift alertness of movement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first I spent the daylight hours on the south-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward beach watching for a ship, hoping and pray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for a ship. I counted on the "Ipecacuanha" re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning as the year wore on; but she never came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Five times I saw sails, and thrice smoke; but noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ever touched the island. I always had a bon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire ready, but no doubt the volcanic reputation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island was taken to account for that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was only about September or October that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to think of making a raft. By that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">my arm had healed, and both my hands were at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">service again. At first, I found my helplessness ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">palling. I had never done any carpentry or such-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like work in my life, and I spent day after day in</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimental chopping and binding among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees. I had no ropes, and could hit on nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherewith to make ropes; none of the abundant</seg><seg type="columnLine">creepers seemed limber or strong enough, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">all my litter of scientific education I could not de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vise any way of making them so. I spent more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a fortnight grubbing among the black ruins of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enclosure and on the beach where the boats had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been burnt, looking for nails and other stray pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of metal that might prove of service. Now and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">some Beast-creature would watch me, and go leaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">off when I called to it. There came a season of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder-storms and heavy rain, which greatly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarded my work; but at last the raft was completed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was delighted with it. But with a certain lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of practical sense which has always been my bane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had made it a mile or more from the sea; and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore I had dragged it down to the beach the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen to pieces. Perhaps it is as well that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was saved from launching it; but at the time my</seg><seg type="columnLine">misery at my failure was so acute that for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">days I simply moped on the beach, and stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water and thought of death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not, however, mean to die, and an incident</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred that warned me unmistakably of the folly</seg><seg type="columnLine">of letting the days pass so,--for each fresh day was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fraught with increasing danger from the Beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">People.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was lying in the shade of the enclosure wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring out to sea, when I was startled by something</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold touching the skin of my heel, and starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">round found the little pink sloth-creature blinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">into my face. He had long since lost speech and</seg><seg type="columnLine">active movement, and the lank hair of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute grew thicker every day and his stumpy claws</seg><seg type="columnLine">more askew. He made a moaning noise when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw he had attracted my attention, went a little way</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the bushes and looked back at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first I did not understand, but1 presently it</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred to me that he wished me to follow him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this I did at last,--slowly, for the day was hot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When we reached the trees he clambered into them,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> for he could travel better among their swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">creepers than on the ground. And suddenly in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trampled space I came upon a ghastly group. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saint-Bernard-creature lay on the ground, dead;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and near his body crouched the Hyena-swine, grip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping the quivering flesh with its misshapen claws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gnawing at it, and snarling with delight. As I ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached, the monster lifted its glaring eyes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine, its lips went trembling back from its red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stained teeth, and it growled menacingly. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not afraid and not ashamed; the last vestige of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human taint had vanished. I advanced a step</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther, stopped, and pulled out my revolver. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">last I had him face to face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The brute made no sign of retreat; but its ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back, its hair bristled, and its body crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">together. I aimed between the eyes and fired. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did so, the Thing rose straight at mo in a leap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was knocked over like a ninepin. It clutched</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me with its crippled hand, and struck me in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Its spring carried it over me. I fell under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hind part of its body; but luckily I had hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I meant, and it had died even as it leapt. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled out from under its unclean weight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up trembling, staring at its quivering body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That danger at least was over; but this, I knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only the first of the series of relapses that</seg><seg type="columnLine">must come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I burnt both of the bodies on a pyre of brush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood; but after that I saw that unless I left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island my death was only a question of time. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beast People by that time had, with one or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceptions, left the ravine and made themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">lairs according to their taste among the thickets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the island. Few prowled by day, most of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept, and the island might have seemed deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a new-comer; but at night the air was hideous</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their calls and howling. I had half a mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make a massacre of them; to build traps, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight them with my knife. Had I possessed sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">cartridges, I should not have hesitated to begin the</seg><seg type="columnLine">killing. There could now be scarcely a score left</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dangerous carnivores; the braver of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">were already dead. After the death of this poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog of mine, my last friend, I too adopted to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent the practice of slumbering in the daytime in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to be on my guard at night. I rebuilt my den</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the walls of the enclosure, with such a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening that anything attempting to enter must</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessarily make a considerable noise. The crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures had lost the art of fire too, and recovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fear of it. I turned once more, almost pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sionately now, to hammering together stakes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches to form a raft for my escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I	found a thousand difficulties. I am an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremely unhandy man (my schooling was over be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the days of Slojd); but most of the require-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of a raft I met at last in some clumsy, cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuitous way or other, and this time I took care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strength. The only insurmountable obstacle</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that I had no vessel to contain the water I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should need if I floated forth upon these untravelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas. I would have even tried pottery, but the is-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land contained no clay. I used to go moping about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island, trying with all my might to solve this</seg><seg type="columnLine">one last difficulty. Sometimes I would give way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild outbursts of rage, and hack and splinter some</seg><seg type="columnLine">722</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Unlucky tree in my intolerable vexation. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could think of nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then came a day, a wonderful day, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I spent in ecstasy. I saw a sail to the southwest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small sail like that of a little schooner; and forth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">with I lit a great pile of brushwood, and stood by it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the heat of it, and the heat of the midday sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching. All day I watched that sail, eating or</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinking nothing, so that my head reeled; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beasts came and glared at me, and seemed to won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, and went away. It was still distant when night</seg><seg type="columnLine">came and swallowed it up; and all night I toiled, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep my blaze bright and high, and the eyes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beasts shone out of the darkness, marvelling. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dawn the sail was nearer, and I saw it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirty lug-sail of a small boat. But it sailed strange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. My eyes were weary with watching, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered and could not believe them. Two men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the boat, sitting low down,--one by the bows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other at the rudder. The head was not kept to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind; it yawed and fell away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the day grew brighter, I began waving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last rag of my jacket to them; but they did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice me, and sat still, facing each other, I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lowest point of the low headland, and gesti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culated and shouted. There was no response, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat kept on her aimless course, making slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">very slowly, for the bay. Suddenly a great white</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird flew up out of the boat, and neither of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred nor noticed it; it circled round, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came sweeping overhead with its strong wings out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I stopped shouting, and sat down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">headland and rested my chin on my hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared. Slowly, slowly, the boat drove past towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the west. I would have swum out to it, but some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing--a cold, vague fear--kept me back, and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">it a hundred yards or so to the westward of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins of the enclosure. The men in it were dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been dead so long that they fell to pieces when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I. tilted the boat on its side and dragged them out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One had a shock of red hair, like the captain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "Ipecacuanha," and a dirty white cap lay in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I stood beside the boat, three of the Beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">came slinking out of the bushes and sniffing towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. One of my spasms of disgust came upon me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thrust the little boat down the beach and clam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered on board her. Two of the brutes were Wolf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts, and came forward with quivering nostrils</seg><seg type="columnLine">and glittering eyes; the third was the horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">nondescript of bear and bull.J When I saw them</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching those wretched remains, heard them</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarling at one another and caught the gleam of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their teeth, a frantic horror succeeded my repulsion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I turned my back upon them, struck the lug and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began paddling out to sea. I could not bring my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to look behind me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I lay, however, between the reef and the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night, and the next morning went round to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stream and filled the empty keg aboard with</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Then, with such patience as I could com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand, I collected a quantity of fruit, and waylaid</seg><seg type="columnLine">and killed two rabbits with my last three cartridges.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While I was doing this I left the boat moored to</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inward projection of the reef, for fear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beast People.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Man Alone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the evening I started, and drove out to sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">before a gentle w'ind from the southwest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, steadily; and the island grew smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smaller, and the lank spire of smoke dwindled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a finer and finer line against the hot sunset. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean rose up around me, hiding that low, dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">patch from my eyes. The daylight, the trailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">glory of the sun, went streaming out of the sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was drawn aside like some luminous curtain, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last I looked into the blue gulf of immensity</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the sunshine hides, and saw the floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">hosts of the stars. The sea was silent, the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">was silent. I was alone with the night and silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I drifted for three days, eating and drinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparingly, and meditating upon all that had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to me,--not desiring very greatly then to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">men again. One unclean rag was about me, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair a black tangle: no doubt my discoverers thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a madman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is strange, but I felt no desire to return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind. I was only glad to be quit of the foul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the Beast People. And on the third day I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was picked up by a brig from Apia to San Fran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisco. Neither the captain nor the mate would be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve my story, judging that solitude and danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made me mad; and fearing their opinion might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be that of others, I refrained from telling my ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture further, and professed to recall nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had happened to me between the loss of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lady Vain" and the time when I was picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">again,--the space of a year.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had to act with the utmost circumspection to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save myself from the suspicion of insanity. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory of the Law, of the two dead sailors, of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambuscades of the darkness, of the body in the cane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brake, haunted me; and, unnatural as it seems,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my return to mankind came, instead of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence and sympathy I had expected, a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">enhancement of the uncertainty and dread I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">experienced during my stay upon the island. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">one would believe me; I was almost as queer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">men as I had been to the Beast People. I may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught something of the natural wildness of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions. They say that terror is a disease, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyhow I can witness that for several years now a</seg><seg type="columnLine">restless fear has dwelt in my mind,--such a rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less fear as a half-tamed lion cub may feel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My trouble took the strangest form. I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">persuade myself that the men and women I met</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not also another Beast People, animals half</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrought into the outward image of human souls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that they would presently begin to revert,^</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show first this bestial mark and then that. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have confided my case to a strangely able man,--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man who had known Moreau, and seemed half to</seg><seg type="columnLine">credit my story; a mental specialist,--and he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped me mightily, though I do not expect that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terror of that island will ever altogether leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. At most times it lies far in the back of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, a mere distant cloud, a memory, and a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">distrust; but there are times when the little cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">spreads until it obscures the whole sky. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">look about me at my fellow-men; and I go in fear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I see faces, keen and bright; others, dull or dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous; others, unsteady, insincere,--pono</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">723.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have the calm authority of a reasonable soul. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel as though the animal was surging up through</seg><seg type="columnLine">them; that presently the degradation of the Is-</seg><seg type="columnLine">landers will be played over again on a larger scale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know this is an illusion; that these seeming men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women about me are indeed men and women,--</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and women for ever, perfectly reasonable</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures, full of human desires and tender solici-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude, emancipated from instinct and the slaves of</seg><seg type="columnLine">no fantastic Law,--beings altogether different from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Beast Folk. Yet I shrink from them, from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious glances, their inquiries and assistance, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">long to be away from them and alone. For that</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason I live near the broad free downland, and can</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape thither when this shadow is over my soul;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and very sweet is the empty downland then, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind-swept sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I lived in London the horror was well-nigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">insupportable. I could not get away from men:</seg><seg type="columnLine">their voices came through windows; locked doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">were flimsy safeguards. I would go out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets to fight with my delusion, and prowling wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men would mew after me; furtive, craving men</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance jealously at me; weary, pale workers go</seg><seg type="columnLine">coughing by me with tired eyes and eager paces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like wounded deer dripping blood; old people, bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dull, pass murmuring to themselves; and, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">unheeding, a ragged tail of gibing children. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would turn aside into some chapel,--and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, such was my disturbance, it seemed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">preacher gibbered "Big Thinks," even as the Ape-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had done; or into some library, and there the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intent faces over the books seemed but patient</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures waiting for prey. Particularly nauseous</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the blank, expressionless faces of people in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trains and omnibuses; they seemed no more mtf</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow-creatures than dead bodies would be, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not dare to travel unless I was assured of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being alone. And even it seemed that I too was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reasonable creature, but only an animal tormented</seg><seg type="columnLine">with some strange disorder in its brain which sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to wander alone, like a sheep stricken with gid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This is a mood, however, that comes to me now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thank God, more rarely. I have withdrawn my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self from the confusion of cities and multitudes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spend my days surrounded by wise books,--^</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright windows in this life of ours, lit by the shin*</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing souls of men. I see few strangers, and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a small household. My days I devote to reading</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to experiments in chemistry, and I spend many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the clear nights in the study of astronomy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is--though I do not know how there is or</seg><seg type="columnLine">why there is--a sense of infinite peace and protec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in the glittering hosts of heaven. There it must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, I think, in the vast and eternal laws of matter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not in the daily cares and sins and troubles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men, that whatever is more than animal within</seg><seg type="columnLine">us must find its solace and its hope.

But this manuscript must</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be too long, for even written as it is on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderfully thin and light material, yet I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a care that it is not too heavy for the winged</seg><seg type="columnLine">messenger to whom I intend to entrust it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have already described, to the best of my ability,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the personal or physical appearance of the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings among whom, I fear, I am destined to remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the rest of my life. Also, I have spoken of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their means of communicating with one another and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with myself, and here and there I have given short</seg><seg type="columnLine">accounts of their habits and occupations and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their wonderful inventions and accomplishments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as yet, I have said nothing of their social or</seg><seg type="columnLine">family life, their thoughts, laws, codes, public in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitutions and many other matters which have</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved vastly interesting to me, and may perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest my fellow men if Fate wills that this manu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">script ever reaches them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">There is so much to__</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">write that is strange, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credible and difficult to</seg><seg type="columnLine">describe, that I hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">know where to begin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Many long months passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I could carry on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thought conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly enough to get an</seg><seg type="columnLine">insight into many mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters ; but now that I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been here for over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">year, as nearly as I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure it out, I am able to make myself understood</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to understand them as readily as if we spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">a common language.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First perhaps, I should mention that these crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures are comparatively short lived. They seldom</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach an age which in my world would be forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, but as they mature in an incredibly short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time their lives are proportionately as long as our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own. That is, these creatures become fully grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with fully developed powers, both mentally and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">IN the concluding installment we find our explorer cn-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">meshed deeply in the talons--or should we say claws--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the crustacean civilisation. Imagine his feelings, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only&gt;human being, alone in such' a land of wonders--and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what is going to be the end? Will the lobster-like creat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ures stay beyond the pole, or will they, perhaps, overrun</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the other habited part of the earth? All of this, of course,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you zvill find out as you go on reading the tale with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">breathless interest. It is the best scientifietion story of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the year, so far, and we know you will like it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">physically, in only a few weeks after emerging from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their eggs, so that their life of full mental and</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical power is about forty years, whereas hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man beings who require from twenty to thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years to reach full mental and physical power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to live to sixty or seventy years in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to equal these beings. Moreover, their mental and</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical powers remain unimpaired until death, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">age, as we know it, does not exist. Thus their full</seg><seg type="columnLine">span of life is made available for their utmost en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deavors. I have spoken of them as hatching from</seg><seg type="columnLine">eggs and this was to me a most astounding thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I discovered it But after all it should not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have surprised me, for being crustacean-like, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no reason why they should not have crustacean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like traits of development and life. The eggs aro</seg><seg type="columnLine">deposited in places provided for the purposes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">are there carefully watched over by beings whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives are devoted to the purpose, and the young,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they emerge from the eggs, are separated</seg><seg type="columnLine">into groups, each group or collection being destined</seg><seg type="columnLine">for training, or I might say development, for special</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposes. Thus one group will be destined for</seg><seg type="columnLine">miners, another for chemists, others for artizans</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so on. And the number of young selected for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">_ each group is decided</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">by the demands for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">specific trades or pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessions for which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are destined. Thus, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are a normal num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber. of healthy and able</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodied miners and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity for more, none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the young of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular time will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">destined for that trade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereas, if there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">say two thousand artizans needed that many</seg><seg type="columnLine">young will be set apart for development as artizans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also, if the number of eggs exceeds the number</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the rulers deem necessary, the surplus are</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed before the young emerge. This is a mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter determined by calculations as to the number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings who are expected to die during the year,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the number of inhabitants who can be safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted to exist without danger of want or im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper accommodations. As a result, there is no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">725</seg><seg type="columnLine">726</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">poverty, no want, no idleness and no suffering in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire country and no surplus or lack of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade or profession. To me it seemed a most bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barous and inhuman practice at first, but after all</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are not human. And in many ways it is a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">admirable idea and I cannot help comparing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinary well-being and universal content of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these creatures with the dissatisfaction, poverty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and suffering of the human race. Moreover, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no sickness or illness among them. Any member</seg><seg type="columnLine">injured or ill is at once done away with, for, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">they argue, to cure a sick or injured being neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitates the services of one or more others, even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ill or injured creature survives and recovers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereas, should he or she remain a cripple or unfit</seg><seg type="columnLine">for duty, he or she is an impediment and may re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quire the constant services of others, as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sustenance and support which might be better</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoted to healthy, perfect individuals. It may</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem a merciless system, but these beings have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentiment, affection or love as we know them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their entire lives are devoted to the well being</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the whole community and to performing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">duties alloted them. But I do not mean by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are lacking in pleasures or recreations or are</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceaseless workers like the ants. They realize that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceaseless labor drains their powers and that change</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a necessity, and their hours of work and recrea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion are regulated. But their recreations are to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me most strange. They consist largely of frolick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the water, like genuine water creatures, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">of racing madly about in a sort of dance until utter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly exhausted. Also, they have queer games and</seg><seg type="columnLine">athletic contests, and in these they are often so</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously injured as to result in their being done</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with. Not that the loss of a limb or of sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral limbs amounts to much for these creatures can</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose nearly all their exterior organs and be none</seg><seg type="columnLine">the worse after a few weeks, for like lobsters and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crabs, they grow new limbs or appendages readily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after shedding their skins or shells, appear as</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole as ever. This shedding process was of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">an astounding thing to me at first, though quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural, but it was, I am told, one of the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawbacks to their development and well-being and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in years long past was a terrific problem to solve.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In those days thousands of the creatures shed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">old skins at the same time, and for days thereafter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were soft, tender, almost helpless and unfit for</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty, and thus the entire nation was at a standstill</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was exposed to the attacks of their enemies,--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant ants and other creatures. Gradually, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, by changing diet and regulating the develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of eggs and young, the creatures managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce a race whose members did not shed all at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, but cast off their shells at various seasons, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that only a portion of their numbers were helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">at one time. Moreover, they found that garments</seg><seg type="columnLine">or coverings could be devised to protect their tender</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies and permit them to perform certain duties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, though it was amazing to me at first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are no real family ties and no such things as</seg><seg type="columnLine">love or marriage. The males and females perform</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal work and are on perfect equality and merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate at the call of nature for the purpose of pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pagating the race. At one time, I understand, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings mated for life and reared their own eggs and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">young, but the females gradually rebelled at being</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to take no part in the industries and being</seg><seg type="columnLine">compelled to devote their time to domestic duties,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tfye rulers, finding that the race was dying out</seg><seg type="columnLine">through neglect of eggs and young; and that count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less numbers of the dissatisfied females produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">no offspring, were compelled to accede to the fe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">males' demands and take over all eggs and young</seg><seg type="columnLine">as government wards. This soon led to the females</seg><seg type="columnLine">refusing to mate for any considerable length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, and gradually all family relations were done</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with. Also, this led to the necessity of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">government predetermining the life and occupation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each young individual, and of destroying thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands of eggs each Season. In the old days the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young of an artizan or a miner became miners or</seg><seg type="columnLine">artizans and inherited many of their parents' traits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the fact that the females were obliged to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear their own young resulted in limited numbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of progeny. But with the new order of things it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible to say who were the parents of the ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumulated eggs, and released from all care the</seg><seg type="columnLine">females produced far greater numbers of eggs than</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be raised without overcrowding the country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, I am told, the females in former times were</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite distinct from the males both in physical and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental characters. They were smaller, weaker and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more delicate and were quiet, docile and somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">affectionate. But now I find that it is with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">utmost difficulty'that the two sexes can be distin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guished and that if anything, the females are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger, stronger and more hardy of the two. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, I was amazed to find that most of the soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">or police, as well as many of the miners and laborers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were females, and, so I was told, whatever troubles</seg><seg type="columnLine">01* dissensions had arisen were always caused by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aggressive females.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indeed, I was informed confidentially that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rulers had decided to limit the number of females</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were surreptitiously destroying all female</seg><seg type="columnLine">young not absolutely necessary for the propagation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the race. This was a most difficult matter, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several members of the government were females</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were anxious to increase the numbers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their sex until all power should be in female hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To destroy a young creature after it had emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the egg unless it is malformed, is a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious crime and hitherto no one had been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguish a male from a female egg. But, so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was told, one of the greatest chemists or scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">had discovered a means of determining the egg sex</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fortunately this scientist was a male. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret had been assiduously kept from reaching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">females and so when eggs were to be destroyed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">males could select the female eggs for destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another rather astounding trait that I discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that these creatures are stone deaf when their</seg><seg type="columnLine">skins are first slied and that their ears are quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless until they have placed small pebbles within</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whether the presence of these stones enables</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to communicate with one another, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, without sounds, I cannot say, but it is such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a remarkable habit that I feel sure it must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">some bearing on the matter" (See foot note by Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lyman)1.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 (Foot note by Dr. Lyman)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It 13 apparent tliat Mr. Bishop's studies along the lines of science</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND THE POLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This habit and their habit of shedding led to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">most amusing incident soon after my arrival in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. Feeling in need of a bath I made my way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lake, and disrobing, plunged into the water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I emerged I found a group of the creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered about my ragged clothing and examining</seg><seg type="columnLine">the garments with the greatest interest and evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement. Then they insisted upon feeling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my naked body and expressed the greatest amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that I had changed so greatly in appearance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they were still more amazed when I again put</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my clothes. Then one of the beings brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">several pebbles which he--with kindly intentions</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt--tried to insert in my ears. It was with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greatest difficulty that I prevented this and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the creatures found that I could hear without</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bits of stone they were absolutely dumbfounded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neither could they understand--and cannot to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">day--why I should not be able to remain under</seg><seg type="columnLine">water for hours and crawl about on the bottom as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But to return to their lives and habits. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">government, as I have called it, is not like anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">on our part of the earth. There are to be sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain members of the race to whom I have re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred as rulers, but they are not rulers in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary sense. The goverment, if such it may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">called, consists of a great number of individuals</seg><seg type="columnLine">chosen by the inhabitants to perform certain duties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus one lot had charge of the eggs, another</seg><seg type="columnLine">regulates the production of metal, another looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the food supplies, another has charge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings and so on. Each community appoints a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain number of the members of each of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">groups, and those appointed cannot do anything nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">make any rules or decisions without the knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and consent of the communities from which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are appointed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moreover, as these regulators or committeemen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I may call them, are reared from the eggs with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sole purpose of fulfilling such duties, they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no other objects or purposes in life and carry out</seg><seg type="columnLine">their duties honestly and to the best of their abili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each one is delegated to his post for life, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he or she fails to carry out his or her duties,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or in any way disobeys the orders of the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munity, dire punishment results.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In former times this was death, but the beings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though so heartless and cold blooded in many ways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done away with the death penalty now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">have hit upon a far more sensible plan which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a credit to human beings. To destroy life, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">argue, is, if the being is healthy and uninjured, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss to the community and necessitates a vast</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and xoSJogy had not brought to his attention tho well known fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that many if not all crustaceans possess this same habit. Indeed, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">common decapods--lobsters and crabs--are altnost helpless nnd appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lack the sense of direction and the power of definite movements</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hearing until tiny grains of sand had been inserted in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Possibly, in the super-developed crustaeean-like creatures Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bishop describes, the pebbles in the ears have soino bearing upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">their strange means of inter-communication, .acting possibly as sensi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive detectors to vibratory waves or as sound amplifiers to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves audible. Mr. Bishop also forgot, or was not aware, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher vertebrates and even human beings possess small bones or 6ony</seg><seg type="columnLine">objectS'in the ears. The exact use of these has never been definitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascertained; although_it is known that they control the sense of bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">11 is .^Possible that they also serve to pick up iti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cudiblc waves and thus give human beings and other mammals a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of direction or the "sixth sense" so much more developed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">eomc individuals than others. It is even within the bounds of pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cioility that the inexplicable feats of mental telepathy and mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading may depend upon the development or sensitiveness of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear boues.--A. E.

So, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of killing offenders, the violator of law or</seg><seg type="columnLine">customs is sent to a far distant part of the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is devoted entirely to such offenders, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is forced to rely upon his or her own resources</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live and succeed. It is in this way that all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">communities are first established. These convict</seg><seg type="columnLine">colonies, as I might call them, are under the super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision of the chief settlement and each year are</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If all is going well a certain number of the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">of both sexes and different professions is alloted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them, while if matters are not being carried out</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfactorily the colony is broken up and the mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers divided among other new colonies in still more</seg><seg type="columnLine">isolated parts of the land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moreover, any disturbances or troubles which</seg><seg type="columnLine">may arise or any rebellions against the authorities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are quickly quelled without loss of life or bloodshed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is done by simply turning off the power in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the community where the trouble occurs, and, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the power from the great central station, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings are utterly helpless. They cannot have light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot prepare food, cannot use their airships and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot exist for any length of time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have spoken of the soldiers or police, and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that as there is no further need for them they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are being given up, and that no new members of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the force are being raised. Wars among themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">are things of the distant past and the only use for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the police today is to regulate sanitary and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">rules and to act as escorts or guards and to prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">injuries in crowds or through accidents. But such</seg><seg type="columnLine">things are now so rare and the beings are so well</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained and so careful to follow out all rules and</seg><seg type="columnLine">regulations, which they make themselves, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police have little to do. Indeed, I was told that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion of my arrival was the first time that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">body had been called out in more than twenty years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have so often spoken of things occurring in</seg><seg type="columnLine">years past or of happenings ages ago that a word</seg><seg type="columnLine">of explanation is necessary. There is, I found, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of the creatures whose sole duty is to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the history and records of the country and its deni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zens. These records are never written, but are re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained in the minds of the historians. And, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credible as it may appear, so long have these beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">been trained to this one duty that their power to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember the most minute details is simply amaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. They know nothing else to be sure, and are</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost too helpless even to move or feed themselves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for every sense is devoted to storing away facts</seg><seg type="columnLine">for future reference. Of course one would think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there must come a time when the historical</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts would become so numerous that no brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hold them, but this is overcome in a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">clever manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one member of the historian group is expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remember more than a certain number of facts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or more than a certain number of different facts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each member retains facts of his own particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">class which cover a certain period so that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings are like a number of volumes. Each year</seg><seg type="columnLine">the number of historians in each class is increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">by two, or, as I might say, the living volumes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nation's history are added to annually, one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new members of each class absorbing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">728</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">memorizing all the data of the oldest historian in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his class, while the other new member of each class</seg><seg type="columnLine">memorizes every event in his line which occurs dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the year following *his appointment. Thus the</seg><seg type="columnLine">material known to the older members is always</seg><seg type="columnLine">duplicated in a young new member and cannot be</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost if the former dies -or -meets with an accident,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while new events are recorded on fresh brains with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out adding to the burden on the older ones. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">present time there are approximately twenty-thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand of these living volumes of history and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of calculations--which I found far more in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volved than working out a ship's position by stars--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found that the history thus available covers a</seg><seg type="columnLine">period of about thirty-two thousand years, for in</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier days the new members were not appointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">annually. Of course it is a rather difficult matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look up any certain fact with such a mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">history to refer to, but the fact that each class or</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of incidents is in the mental charge of separate</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings renders it more easy. Thus there are beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">who knows nothing of history-with the exception of</seg><seg type="columnLine">industrial events, others know only those occur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rences related to politics, others to inventions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">others to wars and still others whose minds are</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with facts and data regarding scientific mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as I have said before there is no such time</seg><seg type="columnLine">as years as we know them, all time being divided</seg><seg type="columnLine">or calculated from generation to generation, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the new broods of the creatures arrive very</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly a year apart--as nearly as I can figure it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">--their computation of time corresponds roughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our years. And now, while I think of it, let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me mention a most remarkable thing which at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted my attention from the first, but which re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained a mystery to me for a long time. I men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned that when I first reached the land I noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">an intense blue quality to the light, and after my</seg><seg type="columnLine">first amazement at the strange inhabitants and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion at my surroundings had passed, I noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was no night. At first I thought that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mistaken in this and that I had merely slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twenty-four hours through, but I soon dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered that darkness never descended on this land,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that bright light streamed steadily from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. I had thought this=was most amazing and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun always shone. But I soon found that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not the case, and that there were streamers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light like the aurora which, however, remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadfast and like great bands of blinding flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">constantly'shedding their light upon the place. More-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, these bands gave, as I have said, a blue or</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather violet light, but whether this was the actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">color of the light itself or was due to some peculiar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity in the atmosphere I have never learned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I feel sure, however, that this ceaseless daylight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the fact that the warm and balmy climate</seg><seg type="columnLine">never varies ten degrees, was the cause of all animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">life growing to huge proportions, and also aided</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange crustacean-like beings to reach such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high state of development. It also accounted for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their dwelling being underground, while the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality of the light-was, I found, an important fac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor in many things. Later, as I shall explain, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered that without it many remarkable things</seg><seg type="columnLine">were impossible. But I am digressing and must re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to the subject of the inhabitants, although it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was the fact that the light had a great influence</seg><seg type="columnLine">on them that caused me to make a note of the double</seg><seg type="columnLine">suns and the light at this point of my narrative.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stated that each Class of the inhabitants was</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct, and that the appendages of a miner, arti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zan, chemist, etc., were adapted to the duties of each,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet I soon found that the newly hatched young</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all identical. ^Moreover, they bore no slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">resemblance to the adults. They were, in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulpy, soft, misshapen things with immense goggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, spiny heads, and with slender, worm-like,</seg><seg type="columnLine">naked bodies bearing ten little flipper-like append-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages. A few hours after hatching out they shed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their skins and altered in appearance, and every</seg><seg type="columnLine">day or two thereafter, their shells were cast, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with each shedding they became more and more like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the full grown creatures. But during this period</seg><seg type="columnLine">between hatching and- full development, they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be incredibly altered .or changed by being fed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain foods or chemicals and by being exposed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain forces, or I might say rays, produced by</seg><seg type="columnLine">combinations of the black mineral and sulphur com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds. Thus, if a batch of young is selected to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemists they are specially treated as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatched, and each time their skins are cast their ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendages become more and more like those of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemists, until when fully developed, they are per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly adapted to their predestined trade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I must not forget, too, to call attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that there are no rich or well-to-do members</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the community, that is, in the way that we under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand riches. Some of the beings have more luxur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious homes than others, some seem more brilliantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">garbed, and some possess air ships while others do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not. But anyone may if he or she desires, have as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as any of the others. It is all a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wishes and personal tastes, for the resources of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire country are equally at the disposal of all. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">that any inhabitant can demand a luxurious home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnificently colored garments and a ftuge airship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whatever is allowed the being is his or her just</seg><seg type="columnLine">dues as a pro-rata share of all and if a taste runs</seg><seg type="columnLine">to airships rather than luxuries at -home, the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividual can follow his or her taste in the matter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All power, light and sustenance are however equally</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided and there is no such thing as money or</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade. Services are the only values here, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">each trade or profession is predetermined, all ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vices are accounted of equal value and there are no</seg><seg type="columnLine">social cliques or lines and no aristocracy. A miner</seg><seg type="columnLine">or laborer is equal in every way to one of the rulers</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the guardians of the community, and is entitled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an equal share in everything needed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the large ships, such as the one in which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had traveled across the sea to the city, were I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">community craft. They are, so to speak, govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment airships and constantly patrol the entire coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try, or are used in carrying workers to far distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">places and distributing necessities and supplies</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the inhabitants. They are the only means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of transportation and I was amazed that these be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings should have invented such marvelous craft and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet know nothing of railways, motor cars, or in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact any form of wheeled vehicle. But I discovered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short time ago, why this is so, and my discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, in many ways, far more astonishing than any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing I had learned since reaching this remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">land.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND THE POKE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">729</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I FIND, that for some reason, I have become</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly changed since reaching this strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. I have become philosophical, or per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps I might better say pessimistic, and I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent many hours pondering on matters to which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitherto, I gave no thought. I have wondered why</seg><seg type="columnLine">these beings exist, why they toil and labor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress, and what part they play in the scheme ox</seg><seg type="columnLine">this universe. When I have asked what object they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had in view, why they strove, I have been told</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was for the good of the race, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefit of the nation, for the future of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind. Exactly the same answers that I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard to similar queries from humans. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I have wondered, is that good, that benefit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that future? Meaningless words, I think. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">are these creatures, laboring that they may live,</seg><seg type="columnLine">living that they may labor,--in an endless circle. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sure they have advanced in some ways far beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">my fellow men, and no doubt will advance still more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but of what avail? They are but giant crustaceans</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all, and they hatch from eggs, toil through</seg><seg type="columnLine">life at the tasks to which they are trained, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to their death and are forgotten after their</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief span of life has been spent, and the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows not even that they exist. And on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the world, in the land of men, human beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">are born, labor and die utterly unknown to these</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings. What does it all mean; what place has it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all in the scheme of the Universe, I wonder? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I think on such matters I feel that after all</seg><seg type="columnLine">my life is of little moment, that though I am here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my lot is cast among such weird beings, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes no difference to the world or to the future,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I am but an atom of the whole, one of countless</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions of cogs in the gigantic wheel of nature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And while I cannot fathom the riddle of life yet I</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel that I must have my place in the whole, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fate has seen fit to place me here and that, even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the puny efforts of men and of these creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to lead nowhere, yet must each one of us, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, be as essential to the machinery of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Universe as any cog in a real wheel, and without</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the whole vast mechanism would jar and jolt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and go wrong. So, instead of brooding upon my</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot and spending my time vainly wishing to regain</seg><seg type="columnLine">my fellow men, I have become resigned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I can find no affection, no liking, no fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling for these beings. They have treated me</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindly, my every want is provided for, and I occupy</seg><seg type="columnLine">a far more important place than ever I could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled in my world. And in brains, in attainments</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in many other ways these beings are even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">human than human beings. Yet so strongly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluenced are we by physical appearances that to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">these creatures are still but beasts and I feel apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them and with little in common. It is perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">akin to the feeling that one race of human beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">has for another, the same feeling that prevents the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white and black races from thorough sympathy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding, and that creates prejudices and ill</seg><seg type="columnLine">feelings in the nations of the world I knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And another thing. These beings, though so</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligent, so industrious, so far advanced, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">such brainless, silly creatures! Though they toil</seg><seg type="columnLine">and work feverishly and seem to have no idle mom-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ents to spare, yet they will cease all, will drop every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing and gather in crowds for the most trivial rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons. Yes, even without a reason. Let one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scurrying, hurrying workers stop and gaze about</seg><seg type="columnLine">and instantly a crowd collects, all gazing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same direction, though there is nothing unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be seen, and quite forgetting the tasks on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were sent. And they are childish to a degree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The simplest, most nonsensical things will fascinate</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to such an extent that everything is at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">standstill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Wishing to find exercise and recreation I devised</seg><seg type="columnLine">a set of ninepins and a ball, and at sight of these,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throngs grew wildly excited. They gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, waving their antennae, turning their long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalked eyes about, dropping everything, and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an entire day practically all work was abandoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the beings amused themselves with my crude</seg><seg type="columnLine">toys. Tossing a ball and catching it, spinning a</seg><seg type="columnLine">top, and a score of other simple amusements, proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally exciting and interesting to the beings, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rulers begged me to confine my activities at</seg><seg type="columnLine">such things to recreation hours for fear a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">calamity might result.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But after all in such matters they are much like</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and I wonder if the planets are inhabited and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if their denizens also possess similar characteristics</seg><seg type="columnLine">and peculiarities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  All this, however, is leading me from the course</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my narrative. I have mentioned that I dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered why the beings had no vehicles, save air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships, and why, though they were so far in advance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of human science, they apparently knew nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of many of our most useful and important every</seg><seg type="columnLine">day matters and inventions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came about in this way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was seated upon the shores of the lake and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing across its broad and tranquil surface towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dim and distant mountain ranges. Sailor-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind turned to boats. What a pleasure it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, I thought, to have some good craft in which to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sail those waters, to go where I willed and to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plore the shores. I had traveled much in the beings'</seg><seg type="columnLine">airships, but I could not handle the contraptions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I longed for the feel of a keel under my feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And why shouldn't my desires be satisfied? To be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, I knew that to secure wood to build a boat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the question; but there was the metal sul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phur. This could be made in thin sheets and a metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat could be constructed. But then, I thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how would I manage to make the creatures under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand what I wanted? And even if I did could</seg><seg type="columnLine">they bend and form and rivet the plates? Then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant idea came to me. Why shouldn't the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">be fashioned of one single piece, moulded or cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">into form? It could be. And thus made it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger and better in every way than if built up</seg><seg type="columnLine">of plates. Strange that I had not thought of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner. The airships' hulls were thus formed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had only to make a model of the craft I wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order to have the creatures turn out a seamless</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal boat of incredible lightness and strength.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a time, however, even the simple matter of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">model puzzled me until it occurred to me to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">this from a very thin sheet of metal which, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable trouble, I pounded and bent into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired shape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The result of my work, and rny efforts to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">730</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the artizans grasp my ideas, was a boat about eigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen feet in length and five feet beam drawing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">three feet aft. I cannot say the lines of the craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">were beautiful and I had no expectation of finding</seg><seg type="columnLine">her speedy, but she was staunch and buoyant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thoroughly enjoyed fitting her up. Metal tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were used for mast and spars, twisted fibre or yarns</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the same material as the beings used for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">textiles formed ropes and lines, and the sails were</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of the same fabric. All the time I was work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the creatures regarded my labors with intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest, though at an entire loss to know what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about. But of all things the tackle and blocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to fascinate them the most. And when at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last my craft was ready and I hoisted sails, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasping the tiller, trimmed the sheets and sped off</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a fresh breeze, the creatures went almost mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">with excitement. Here, indeed, was a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition of affairs. Beings who had gone far</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond man's dreams in accomplishments, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquered the air and yet knew nothing of boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">or of sails and had never even seen blocks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tackle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of my cruises in the craft I need say little. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">her I navigated the chain of great lakes or inland</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas, visiting out of the way spots and landing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very place where I had first thrown myself upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beach to drink the water after my terrible jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney. Here I again attempted to scale the mountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">as have already mentioned. But either the climate</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the air had affected me, for before I had ascended</seg><seg type="columnLine">half way to the summits of the ridge I was utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent and was forced to retrace my steps. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a great blow to me for I had hoped that sooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">or later I would be able to make my way back over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountains to the Antarctic and that I thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">might rejoin my fellow men. The perils I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">were terrible and there was not one chance in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">million of my succeeding, but even this slim chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was I felt better than to remain forever among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weird beings. Even when I found it impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was not utterly discouraged. Possibly, I thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there might be lower spots in the mountain range,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in the end I found that the country was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely girded by towering mountains and that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot where I had crossed was the only point where</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a crossing had been possible. But all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is apart from what I was about to set down. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">my explorations, however, I found that which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a direct bearing upon my discovery as to why most</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple mechanical devices were unknown to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures. In one spot I discovered a vast deposit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of coal, in another quantities of copper, and I also</seg><seg type="columnLine">found iron, silver, gold and many other metals and</seg><seg type="columnLine">minerals. Oddly enough, too, the ores seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been mined, for there were yawning openings</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with debris which appeared to be old shafts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tunnels, and yet I knew the beings used none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the metals nor coal. But the discovery of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter started a new train of thought in my mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Could I not equip my craft with power and thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to cruise about more rapidly and without</seg><seg type="columnLine">being dependent upon the wind ? Of course I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have induced the creatures to supply me with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange invisible power they utilized, but somehow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I longed for familiar things, for devices with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 was acquainted, and I cannot hope to express the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great comfort and happiness I found in my little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">boat. Moreover, I felt the necessity of keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and mind busy and so I at once decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">try my mechanical skill at designing and building</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small steam engine. Of course my knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery was limited, but I knew the principles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steam and steam engines, and after weeks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">weary work and innumerable disappointments I</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to turn out a crude sort of affair which</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually worked. To be sure it was far too cumber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some and heavy, not to mention its small power, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my craft, but once having mastered the affair I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a second attempt would prove far easier and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more satisfactory than the first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the creatures, who had ' patched every step of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work, showed indescribable excitement as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke rose from the funnel and the steam hissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the fly wheel revolved. From far and near</seg><seg type="columnLine">they flocked, more excited than I had ever seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and I realized how Watt or Fulton or other</seg><seg type="columnLine">great inventors must have felt when at last they</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved that their theories were right and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstrated to a wondering multitude that steam</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be harnessed and made to serve man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then came an astounding discovery. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rulers wished to take possession of my crude engine;</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to operate it, but to place it in a special build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, a sort of museum as I might say, as a prized</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure. This was, I considered, not unnatural,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but when one of the historians--he who held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most ancient records of the race,--explained that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dim history of the past the beings had made and</seg><seg type="columnLine">used such things, I was absolutely dumbfounded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No one, he informed me, had ever seen the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines; they were merely tradition and were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered fabulous, and all unwittingly I had material-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized something which by them was regarded very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as we regarded relics of the Pharaohs or</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our prehistoric ancestors. Then the living</seg><seg type="columnLine">volume of the nation's history went on to explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that legendary lore had it that the creatures'</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient forebears had possessed many other</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange and unknown devices and I was asked if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not also make some of these as fellow ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hibits in the historical museum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here then I found myself suddenly transformed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a great inventor, proud of exhibiting my</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior knowledge and mechanical ability, to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitive being, a being out of the dim past, a mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of a race whose greatest achievements had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">known, used and discarded by these super-crusta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceans so long ago that even history held no actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">records of them. It was a great shock to my pride,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I was quite willing to busy myself at any work</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would keep me occupied, even if it went only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prove how far behind the times I wras, and soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">I became vastly interested in the wrork and, by my</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts, reconstructing the forgotten past for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange beings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among the first things that I built was a cart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this amazed the creatures even more than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine. To them wheels were most marvelous</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, akin, I should say from their actions, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">magic or witchcraft, and I racked my brains to</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzle out how it was that the wheel, which I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">always considered man's most important mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">invention, should have been discarded and forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the lobster-like beings. Man cannot get on with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the wheel. It is the foundation, the basis, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND THE POLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">731</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">all industry, all machinery, all our most wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplishments. And yet, here was a nation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">highly intelligent creatures, a race which had ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced immeasurably beyond humans in annihilat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing space and time, beings who had tapped the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">source of nature's storehouse of power and who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made marvelous discoveries and never used a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel in any form. To them the wheel was as ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solete and as useless as a stone axe or a flint knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us, but instantly, as they saw wheels, they became</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinated with their uses and possibilities. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were of any real benefit in their lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">or occupations, but merely because they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange, antique curiosities which afforded the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings new amusements and sports. Soon, carts or</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagons were everywhere, and being most adaptable</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures, the inhabitants were not long in fitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vehicles with power receivers and were rattling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bumping about in crude motor cars, or rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor wagons, as pleased as a lot of kids with new</seg><seg type="columnLine">toys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could not help thinking how this same power</seg><seg type="columnLine">applied to modern automobiles would revolutionize</seg><seg type="columnLine">jnotor cars in our world, and I fell to work with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">will striving to construct some sort of car which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be an improvement over the solid wheeled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncomfortable things the creatures were using. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot say that the result of my labors and inven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive powers would have been a worthy rival even of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tin Lizzie, but it had a greater vogue among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings than even Ford's famous product had among</seg><seg type="columnLine">humans, and motoring became the favorite sport of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire country. Incredibly swift airships were</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned, save for utility and business, and just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we human beings--or a large number of us--</seg><seg type="columnLine">prefer sail boats or rowing, or even the primitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage canoe, to the steam or power boat when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes to recreation, or choose a slow-going horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carriage rather than a railway train or a motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">car for pleasure, so they preferred the crude vehicles</seg><seg type="columnLine">bumping over the earth to the silent, smooth sailing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteor-like airships. I cannot describe, cannot hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give a picture of the ridiculous, grotesque ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance the creatures presented in their new toys.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And accidents were innumerable. Indeed, I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is the danger, the risk in using land vehicles, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeals most strongly to the creatures. They seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to delight in collisions, in broken limbs, and are</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckless beyond words. No doubt the dangers are a</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief, for their airships are so constructed that ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cidents are next to impossible and collisions cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">occur, for there are devices which operate in such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way that if two ships come dangerously close the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanisms automatically operate to repel each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Few fatalities have, however, resulted from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of wheeled vehicles, but beings lacking one or</seg><seg type="columnLine">more appendages or even antennae are seen every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where. And they are marvelously expert in avoiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">mishaps by a hair's breadth. Never have I seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">such mad driving and the worst traffic jams of New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York's thoroughfares are nothing compared with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the congestion here in this metropolis of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange land. And the wheels are used for many</seg><seg type="columnLine">other amusements too. There are contraptions for</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I am responsible which might be called bicy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles, and hoop-rolling is a sport over which the be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ings grow as excited and become as interested as</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings over golf or tennis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And of course, having seen the wonderful results</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my efforts and my, to them, prehistoric knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge, I tried my hand at a thousand and one other</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters. Bows and arrows were most astounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">things to these beings, and you can imagine my</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement when, not content with using a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow, these weird creatures armed themselves with</seg><seg type="columnLine">three bows at once and discharged a perfect hail of</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows at the targets. What warriors they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make, I thought. What unconquerable foes, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ten appendages or limbs, eight of which could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be used for handling weapons. Each in fact would</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal eight men in one, and for the first time it</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawned upon me that herein was largely the secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their great .achievements, that they had been able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accomplish eight times as much work as</seg><seg type="columnLine">humans, and I wondered what the results would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been had Edison, Ford, Marconi or any of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">great inventors and geniuses been equipped by na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture to do eight times the work they have done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their aptitude with such primitive weapons as</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows and arrows aroused my interest as to what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would do with firearms, and I bent my energies</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inventive powers to the task of making such</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. There was an abundance of sulphur, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, saltpeter was to be had and charcoal was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">an impossibility, but it was a long time before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded in making a mixture that would do more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than sputter and burn. But at last I had an apology</seg><seg type="columnLine">for gunpowder and the rest was simple. I had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small cannon made, and having loaded it and placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sheet metal target before it, I touched it off. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder was poor, slow burning stuff, but it served</seg><seg type="columnLine">to throw the ball and made a respectable detonation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I was greatly disappointed at the effect upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembled creatures who had gathered to watch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstration. The noise and smoke did not sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise them in the least, but I might have foreseen</seg><seg type="columnLine">this as they possessed an explosive far more power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful than powder or even dynamite. In fact it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether too powerful for use in firearms, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered with almost fatal results to myself long</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I tried my hand at powder making. They ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amined the ragged hole torn by the missile in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal target and they showed some interest in this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but their greatest wonder appeared to be that an</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive capable of doing so much should have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">confined in the metal barrel of the gun. Aside from</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, however, the whole experiment failed to appeal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them. They had no use for such things as guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">and powder, no need of offensive or defensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons, and their own explosive was a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">times more valuable than powder for their pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And scores of other things which I made, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">endless failures and by dint of hardest work, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">as useless to them as the cannon. And then at last1</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came to me that in this strange place man's great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est inventions, human beings' most marvelous labor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">saving devices and our most prized luxuries and</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveniences had no place. That here was a race</seg><seg type="columnLine">or nation of beings where there was no struggle for</seg><seg type="columnLine">supremacy, no real industry for personal gain, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">riches, no poverty, no competition; that conditions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, everything, were totally unlike those of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">world and that these creatures, ages before my ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">732</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rival, had passed the stage of human civilization and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that to them our customs, habits and mode of life</seg><seg type="columnLine">would appear as barbarous and primitive as those</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the prehistoric cave dwellers to us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is no agriculture, so no demand for agri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cultural machinery. No vast transportation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">foodstuffs and raw materials, for with power wher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever required and food and all things needed--with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exception of sulphur--available anywhere, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is little to be carried and airships are all that are</seg><seg type="columnLine">required. All resources are equally at the disposal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of every member of the community and hence there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no struggle for existence or for wealth, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">every member of the nation is developed, trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">and predestined, from the day of hatching, for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite place in life, there is no ambition, no desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">for advancement. In short these beings are mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatons, machines endowed with life, intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence and minds, and nothing more. They only</seg><seg type="columnLine">differ from insensate mechanisms inasmuch as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have their times for rest and recreation, and I daily</seg><seg type="columnLine">thank God that human beings have not yet come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Often, when among my fellow men, I have heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">arguments and have read articles in favor of a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munistic or socialistic life and government, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">picturing the ideal Utopia that the earth would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">if men could all be equal, if all wealth could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally divided and there could be no class distinc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, no struggle for supremacy. Often, too, I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the past felt that such a state would be desirable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and many a time, when fortune frowned upon me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I compared my lot as a sailor with the ease and</seg><seg type="columnLine">luxury of wealthy passengers upon my ships, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the rich ship owners, I have felt bitterness</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some should be^so favored and others forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle through life in poverty. But now I realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">what dire results would follow were these socialists'</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas fulfilled. Now I realize that there could be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambition, no desire for betterment, no real happi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness in life and no pride if such conditions pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vailed. No, a thousand times no. Better dire</seg><seg type="columnLine">poverty, unending toil, the abuses and vices, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wars and strife, all the wrongs and woes of mankind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and civilization than to become the heartless, imper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal beings that such conditions would lead to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What would the world of men be without love, senti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, art, music, affection, ambition? What would</seg><seg type="columnLine">it be if the human race had no ideals beyond exis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tence and the propagation of the species? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">would it be if there was nothing to spur men on, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">send them to sleep weary with the day's work but</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with dreams and visions of accomplishments</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the morrow; to awaken them filled with deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mination to succeed, to force their way to the top?</seg><seg type="columnLine">What would life amount to if men had no aims, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideals in life, no necessity to exert themselves, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove superiority to their fellows, to force their</seg><seg type="columnLine">individuality upon the world and to choose their</seg><seg type="columnLine">path in life and to be independent, free, leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own lives as they see fit and with no limit, save</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own intelligences and their labors, to what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">may accomplish?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is this, this supposed idealistic sort of life of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these beings that made me so heartily sick of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence among them. Would that those who have</seg><seg type="columnLine">found such fault with our civilization, who have</seg><seg type="columnLine">endeavored to revolutionize human life and human</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ways, and to upset conditions that the Almighty in</seg><seg type="columnLine">His infinite wisdom has established, might be hero</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me. Would that those socialistic agitators</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be forced to exist here among these creatures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anything rather than this state of affairs. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">times it seems as if I should go mad, and I find my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self longing for something, anything, to upset this</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine-like monotonous life about me. Anger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">^strife, battle--aye, even a war with all its horrors</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be welcome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALONG time has passed since I penned my</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines. And now I know that beyond ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion I am doomed to spend all my days</seg><seg type="columnLine">among these weird beings. Over and over again</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have attempted to find a way out, to discover a</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of scaling the mountains, for desperation</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove me, and death upon the ice-covered wastes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the polar regions seemed preferable to life here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But though strong, healthy and as able-bodied as</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, yet, for some strange reason, I could not climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">those cliffs. Perhaps it is the food or drink that</seg><seg type="columnLine">has robbed me of the power to ascend even to</seg><seg type="columnLine">moderate heights, perchance dwelling in this air</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its unending blue light has had its effect, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the creatures who dwell here, I cannot live</seg><seg type="columnLine">where once I felt no ill effects. But whatever the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason, the fact remains that each time I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached a height of a few hundred feet, my muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">have failed me, my strength has given out, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been forced to' give up. I am as hopelessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">caged here as though in a prison and yet the birds</seg><seg type="columnLine">come and go at will and I envy them beyond words</seg><seg type="columnLine">to express, as I watch the broad-winged albatrosses</seg><seg type="columnLine">and great white molly-mokes and screeching gulls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and know on their pinions they can rise above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding mountains and leave this side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world for the other that I shall never see again;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no doubt they gaze upon my fellow men, upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wide blue sea, and upon white sailed ships and</seg><seg type="columnLine">great palatial steamships with the same express-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ionless eyes they turn upon me and upon the beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwelling here in this undreamed-of land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To one of these free winged creatures, these</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends of old who come over the edge of the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">each year, I shall soon entrust this narrative. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance it may never reach a human being. The bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">may meet with disaster or it may never look on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilized man. Or again, even though scores, hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds, of my fellow men see the creatures, yet it may</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass unnoticed and the message may not be read.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But there is a chance that, with the metal cylinder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which I shall place my story&gt; dangling from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg, the albatross will attract the attention of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. Perhaps its nesting ground may be near some</seg><seg type="columnLine">party of whalemen, or even near a settlement, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is this chance I cling to. I have no fear that tho</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder will become detached or even broken, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite the rough treatment it will no doubt receive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even if the bird is not found or the cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">.discovered for years, it and its contents will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">intact. I have selected the toughest and hardest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the many varieties of metal for the cylinder, a metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is far harder than steel and which can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened or broken only by tremendous force or by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat greater than fire, and I have used a trails-</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND THE POLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">733</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">parent grade of the metal in order that any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding it may see that it contains a manuscript,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I -well know how curious human beings are to</seg><seg type="columnLine">read any scrap of writing that is picked up in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating or stranded bottle. The cylinder being air</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight will preserve the manuscript, and the writing</seg><seg type="columnLine">is done with a fluid I found among the waste or</seg><seg type="columnLine">by-products of the sulphur factory. It is indelible</seg><seg type="columnLine">and will not fade, while the cord by which I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">attach the cylinder to my bird messenger is of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">toughest woven metal and cannot be severed by any</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary means.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And what if my narrative is found and read?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Will any mortal man believe it? Will the finder, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">finder there be, credit such a story as will be dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed? No, I suppose not. It is too incredible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too ridiculous to pass as anything more than fiction</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the ramblings of a disordered mind. They will</seg><seg type="columnLine">think the writer crazy, a madman who has been set</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the delusions of his brain, or will think some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one is trying to perpetrate a gigantic hoax.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But again, perhaps, if God wills, my narrative</seg><seg type="columnLine">may fall into the hands of some person who will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">attracted by the strangeness of its container. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">transparent metal cylinder will perhaps arouse cu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riosity, the material on which it is written may give</seg><seg type="columnLine">credence to my tale. And if so, then will it be</seg><seg type="columnLine">known beyond a doubt that it is no wild fancy, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">product of a crazy man; for nowhere in the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men are such materials known. Often I smile to</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself to think what a sensation will be created</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the newspapers print accounts of the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery of the strange manuscript in a still more</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable container. No doubt, in that case, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">story will be read by thousands, perhaps millions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my fellow men. And yet, the cylinder in which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">send it may prove of greater interest and value to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world than my story. I can picture the scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tists' excitement as they analyze the metal and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussions grow hot as to its origin, while inventors</seg><seg type="columnLine">strive to produce the same material for the benefit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mankind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such thoughts are a diversion and a comfort to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and many hours I spend trying to picture in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind the results of my story and its effect upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world in case it ever reaches civilized men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I must cut short my imaginings, my hopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fears, for it is all aside from my tale and I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">confine myself to the story of my life here on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown, mountain-walled continent among these</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird beings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-x- -:&lt;■ *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since I last took up my manuscript to write, many</seg><seg type="columnLine">events have occurred, but that which is of greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance, though the creatures here make little of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, is the escape of the captive ants from the zoo</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherein they were confined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To me there is something threatening in this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I cannot rid myself of a feeling of a dire</seg><seg type="columnLine">calamity impending. Always I had been fascinated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the gigantic insects, and hours after hours I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have spent, watching them as they labored and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed about, drilling, carrying on strange evolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, marching and countermarching, seemingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">aimlessly, within their fenced enclosure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That they could escape, no one dreamed; for as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have said, they were hedged in by network of ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terial fatal to them. But escape they did, and not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an ant remains within the pen nor was there a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant to tell of the insects having touched the death</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealing netting. No, they had been far too intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent for that, and their apparently aimless labors</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been but a clever ruse, a means of concealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">their true purpose of tunelling to great depths and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by means of an unsuspected subterranean passage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanishing, no one knows where. And I feel sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that their constant drilling, their military-like ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, were no more purposeless than their work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To be sure they are few--not more than two hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred at most--and the inhabitants have no fears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They assure me that the ants will soon be recaptur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, that in airships these beings can locate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fugitives and either take or destroy them, and that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if such means fail, the ants may be destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by scattering the deadly compound about their</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunts and by preventing them from securing food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moreover, they point out, the ants are few and</seg><seg type="columnLine">are no menace unless in vast numbers, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">long before they can increase enough to be danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous they will again be under control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> _ But I cannot put aside my fears, my premoni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. Who can say where the ants have gone?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who can say what their numbers may be? For all</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone knows they may have been increasing by</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands beneath the earth, may have been waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for months or years until they had reared a horde</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their kind in the dark, unseen passages under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. And their strength, activity and tireless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, are prodigious. One of the great insects has</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strength of a score of men or the muscular</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers of several giant lobster-like beings. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">they multiply with amazing rapidity. Even now</seg><seg type="columnLine">they may number countless thousands, may be bid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their time in some hidden subterranean lair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">storing food, making plans, drilling; only waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the time when they will be ready and prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to overwhelm the country with their armies. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strangest part of it is that such thoughts should</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble me. Why should it matter to me whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">these lobster-like beings or the giant ants are in</seg><seg type="columnLine">supremacy? Why should I care what takes place in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this country in which I have no interest and which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have grown to hate and detest? It is not fear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal injuries or death, but I shudder at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of being made captive or being destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the ants, for death I feel, might prove bettor</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a life among these creatures. I have tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">analyze my feelings, to fathom the cause of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">worries and, though it sounds ridiculous, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">even to me it seems impossible, yet I feel sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is due to a sense of patriotism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Patriotism for a land that is my prison, for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">race of beings with whom I have nothing in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon! And yet it is so. Although I chafe at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">enforced life here, although I long to be away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country and its denizens, although their life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways and personalities are all repugnant to me, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a strange thing is the human mind that I feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">as greatly concerned over the impending danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if these beings were of my own race and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was my own country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, and if it comes to battle, to a war between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ants and these supercrustaceans, I know in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart that I shall find myself battling against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants, using my every effort to aid these monstrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings in overthrowing their hereditary enemies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">734</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Little did I dream, when I wrote, months ago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that even war would be welcome, how soon my</seg><seg type="columnLine">words were to be borne out, for war, bloody, merci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, relentless and horrible beyond words to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">press is, I feel sure, near at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                   *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A month or more has passed since last I wrote,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, during that interval events have moved rapidly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ants have been discovered. Scouts have found</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and my worst fears have been more than ful-</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled. In incalculable thousands they are swarm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on a vast uninhabited area in the north, drill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, gathering vast stores and evidently preparing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a campaign. And yet these beings are not dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed, have no fears and have made little effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to repel or destroy their enemies. From airships</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantities of the death dealing chemicals were drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped upon the ants but with little result. A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">were killed but instantly the alarm was given the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants vanished like magic, seeking safe refuge in</seg><seg type="columnLine">subterranean burrows. I have urged these crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures to set forth and attack, to take the offensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the ants, to drop explosives from airships</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thus shatter the burrows and destroy the occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pants. And I have sought to induce them to sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">round themselves with barriers of the ant poison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">, But my words have been unheeded so far. So long</seg><seg type="columnLine">have these creatures lived in peace, so long have</seg><seg type="columnLine">they been in complete control, and so many years</seg><seg type="columnLine">have passed since they battled with the ants that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have forgotten the terrible power and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sources of their enemies and underrate them. Too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late, I fear, will they awaken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But I have not been idle. With the aid of a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">who have given ear to my advice I have taken what</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps we can to protect the city. We have laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">mines about it which can be exploded, and in two</seg><seg type="columnLine">airships we have attempted to destroy the ants' re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treats with explosive, but our puny efforts have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been of little avail. Moreover, in our last assault,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the airships was disabled by a premature</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion and fell to earth, and I shudder as I write</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I think of the awful scene I witnessed when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ants rushed upon the occupants of the airship</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with ravenous jaws tore them in pieces while</seg><seg type="columnLine">still alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And if the ants are victorious that will be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate of all, yes even of myself. But I have no mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to meet with such a fearful death. I have provision-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed my boat and if worst comes to worst I shall flee</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her. Across the water the ants cannot follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and miles distant I know of a large island where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall seek safety--there to pass the remaining days</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my life alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A week since I wrote those last lines. The ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">are advancing now. Already they have over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelmed two outlying towns and against them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poison and even the explosives seem useless. Slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly but inexorably they come, making their way by</seg><seg type="columnLine">underground passages, scurrying to safe retreats</seg><seg type="columnLine">far under the earth at first sight of an airship. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is tei'rible, nightmarish, this invisible, silent ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance of the vast hordes of terrible creatures, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inhabitants are now terror stricken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Barriers of the poison have been passed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants tunnelling beneath them; hundreds of the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitants of the countryside have fallen victims to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the relentless insects, and each day their numbers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">increase and they draw nearer to this metropolis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They are within a few miles of the power plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at any moment may take possession of the sul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phur mines. And then the doom of the beings will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sealed. Without resources, without power, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be helpless, doomed to perish miserably or be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come prisoners of the ants. And there is no retreat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The insects have overrun the land, have thrown out</seg><seg type="columnLine">great encircling armies and our scouts report them</seg><seg type="columnLine">on every side</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now a new and more terrible thing has oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred. The ants are swarming. Their queens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">winged and capable of flight, are filling the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkening the skies and dropping here, there, every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where to establish new colonies. Hundreds of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">have even dropped within the city and although they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been destroyed yet their numbers seem un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminished. Unseen, they drop at night, hurrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hidden spots they deposit their eggs, and ere</seg><seg type="columnLine">their presence is suspected the warriors have emerg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed and fall upon the surprised inhabitants and tear</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to bits. In their extremity the creatures have</seg><seg type="columnLine">besought me to equip them with bows and arrows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns, anything in the form of weapons. And these</seg><seg type="columnLine">have helped. With their arrows, with the bullets</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the crude firearms, they have managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the ant army in check, for these are things</seg><seg type="columnLine">new to the ants and they have no means of resisting</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Desperate as our case is, yet I have smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think how history repeats itself, how these be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings have been forced to resort to prehistoric, prim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itive means to preserve their homes and lives, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the armies of Europe, despite modern weapons</seg><seg type="columnLine">high explosives, poisonous gasses and every latest</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific device, were forced to resort to armor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grenades, medieaval weapons and methods to com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bat the Germans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And even the wagons, the motor vehicles, have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been brought into play against the ants, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">airships are next to useless. Let an airship rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloft and the swarming queen ants light upon it by</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds and bear it to earth with their weight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the wheeled vehicles, protected, transformed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to miniature forts of metal and filled with armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings, carry terror and destruction among the ants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushing them beneath the wheels while arrows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets strike them down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But despite all I feel that we are losing, that our</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts have been made too late and that at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment the horde of insects will everwhelm the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power plant and we will be incapable of making</seg><seg type="columnLine">food, of producing light, of manufacturing any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, even of operating our vehicles. Long have I</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreseen this and in preparation for the calamity</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have had steam engines built, but these are all too</seg><seg type="columnLine">few to serve all our wants. Would that these beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">had but given heed to my words long ago and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">all might have been well. Too long they waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then panic stricken turned to me begging me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take charge, beseeching me to save them. The fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the country, of the inhabitants depends upon me</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I feel that no human effoi'ts, nothing that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings under my directions can accomplish, will do</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than delay the end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">* * -x-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What I dreaded most has befallen.

Not in one generation, but in several. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the time when the chemists of the Inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">national Geophysical Institute announced that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportion of carbon dioxide in the air had increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">from .04 per cent to .1 per cent and the time when</seg><seg type="columnLine">at sea-level six per cent of the atmosphere was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly gas, more than two hundred years intervened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Coming gradually, as it did, the poisonous effects</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the deadly stuff increased with insidious slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. First the lassitude, then the heaviness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain, then the weakness of body. Mankind ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">to grow in numbers. After a long period, the race</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen to a fraction of its former size. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was room in plenty on the mountain-tops--but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger-level continued to creep up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was but one solution. The human body</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to inure itself to the poison, or it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doomed to extinction. It finally developed a tolera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion for the gas that had wiped out race after race</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nation after nation, but at a terrible cost.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lungs increased in size to secure the oxygen on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which life depended, but the poison, inhaled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">every breath, left the few survivors sickly and filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a perpetual weariness. Their minds lacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the energy to cope with new problems or transmit</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knowledge they possessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And after thirty thousand years, Burl, a direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">descendant of the first president of the Universal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Republic, crept through a forest of toadstools and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungus growths. He was ignorant of fire, of metals,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the uses of stone and wood. A single garment</seg><seg type="columnLine">was worn by him. His language was a scanty group</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a few hundred labial sounds, conveying no ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stractions and few concrete ideas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was ignorant of the uses of wood. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no wood in the scanty territory furtively inhabited</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his tribe. With the increase in heat and humidity</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees had begun to die out. Those of northern</seg><seg type="columnLine">climes went first, the oaks, the cedars, the maples.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the pines--the beeches went early--the cypresses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finally even the forests of the jungles vanished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only grasses and reeds, bamboos and their kin, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to flourish in the new, steaming atmosphere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thick jungles gave place to dense thickets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasses and ferns, now become tree-ferns again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then the fungi took their place. Flourishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">as never before, flourishing on a planet of torrid</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat and perpetual miasma, on whose surface the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun never shone directly because of an ever-thicken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing bank of clouds that hung sullenly overhead, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungi sprang up. About the dank pools that fest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered over the surface of the earth, fungus growths</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to cluster. Of every imaginable shade and</seg><seg type="columnLine">color, of all monstrous forms and malignant pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poses, of huge size and flabby volume, they spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The grasses and ferns gave place to them. Squat</seg><seg type="columnLine">toadstools, flaking molds, evil-smelling yeasts, vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounds of fungi inextricably mingled as to species,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but growing, forever growing and exhaling an odor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dark places.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The strange growths now grouped themselves in</seg><seg type="columnLine">forests, horrible travesties on the vegetation they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had succeeded. They grew and grew with feverish</seg><seg type="columnLine">intensity beneath a clouded or a haze-obscured sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while above them fluttered gigantic butterflies and</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge moths, sipping daintily of their corruption.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The insects alone of all the animal world above</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, were able to endure the change. They multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied exceedingly, and enlarged themselves in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickened air. The solitary vegetation--as distinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">from fungus growths--that had survived was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">a degenerate form of the cabbages that had once</seg><seg type="columnLine">fed peasants. On those rank, colossal masses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">foliage, the stolid grubs and caterpillars ate them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves to maturity, then swung below in strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocoons to sleep the sleep of metamorphosis from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they emerged to spread their wings and fly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tiniest butterflies of former'days^had "in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased their span until their gaily colored wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be described in terras of feet, while the larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">emperor moths extended their purple sails to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">breadth of yards upon yards. Burl himself would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been dwarfed beneath the overshadowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">fabric of their wings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was fortunate that they, the largest flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures, were harmless or nearly so. Burl's fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low tribesmen sometimes came upon a cocoon just</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to open, and waited patiently beside it until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beautiful creature within broke through its</seg><seg type="columnLine">matted shell and came out into the sunlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, before it had gathered energy from the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and before its wings had swelled to strength and</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmness, the tribesmen fell upon it, tearing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAD PUANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">739</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">filmy, delicate wings from its body and the limbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its carcass. Then, when it lay helpless before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, they carried away the juicy, meat-filled limbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be eaten, leaving the still living body to stare</seg><seg type="columnLine">helplessly at this strange world through its many-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faceted eyes and become a prey to the voracious</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants who would soon clamber upon it, and carry it</seg><seg type="columnLine">away in tiny fragments to their underground city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not all the insect world was so helpless or so</seg><seg type="columnLine">unthreatening. Burl knew of wasps almost the</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of his own body who possessed stings that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were instantly fatal. To every species of wasp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, some other insect is predestined prey, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the furtive members of Burl's tribe feared them</seg><seg type="columnLine">but little, as they sought only, the prey to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">their instinct led them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bees were similarly aloof. They were hard put</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it for existence, those bees. Few flowers bloomed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were reduced to expedients once considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs of degeneracy in their race. They gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubbling yeasts and fouler things, occasionally from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nectarless blooms of the rank, giant cabbages.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl knew the bees. They droned over, nearly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">large as he was himself, their bulging eyes gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him with abstracted preoccupation. And crickets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beetles, and spiders--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl knew spiders! His grandfather had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prey of one of the hunting tarantulas, which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped with incredible ferocity from his excavated</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel in the earth. A vertical pit in the ground, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in diameter, went down for twenty feet. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom of that lair the black-bellied monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited for the tiny sounds that would warn him of</seg><seg type="columnLine">prey approaching his hiding-place. (Lycosa fas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">data).</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl's grandfather had been careless, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible shrieks he uttered as the horrible monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted from the pit and seized him had lingered</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguely in Burl's mind ever since. Burl Tiad seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, the monster webs of another species of spider,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watched from a safe distance as the misshapen</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of the huge creature sucked the juices from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a three-foot cricket that had become entangled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its trap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl had remembered the strange stripes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow and black and silver that crossed upon its</seg><seg type="columnLine">abdomen. (Eyiera fasciata). He had been fas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cinated by the struggles of the imprisoned insect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coiled in a hopeless tangle of sticky, gummy ropes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thickness of Burl's finger, cast about its body</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the spider made any attempt to approach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl knew these dangers. They were a part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life. It was his accustomedness to them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of his ancestors, that made his existence pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible. He was able to evade them; so he survived.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A moment of carelessness, an instant's relaxation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his habitual caution, and .he would be one with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his forebears, forgotten meals of long-dead, inhuman</seg><seg type="columnLine">monsters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three days before, Burl had crouched behind a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulky, shapeless fungus growth while he watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">a furious duel between two huge horned beetles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their jaws, gaping wide, clicked and clashed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">each others' impenetrable armor. Their legs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed like so many cymbals as their polished sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces ground and struck against each other. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fighting over some particularly attractive bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of carrion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl had watched with all his eyes until a gaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">orifice appeared in the armor of the smaller of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two. It uttered a shrill cry, or seemed to cry out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The noise was actually the tearing of the horny</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff beneath the victorious jaws of the adversary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wounded beetle struggled more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">feebly. At last it collapsed, and the conqueror</seg><seg type="columnLine">placidly began to eat the conquered before life was</seg><seg type="columnLine">extinct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl waited until the meal was finished, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached the scene with caution. An ant--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forerunner of many--was already inspecting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carcass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl usually ignored the ants. They were stupid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">short-sighted insects, and not hunters. Save when</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacked, they offered no injury. They were scaven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers, on the look-out for the dead and dying, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would fight viciously if their prey were ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned, and they were dangerous opponents. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were from three inches in length for the tiny black</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants, to a foot for the large termites.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl was hasty when he heard the tiny clickings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their limbs as they approached. He seized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp-pointed snout of the victim, detached from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body, and fled from the scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, he inspected his find with curiosity. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller victim had been a Minotaur beetle, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp-pointed horn like that of a rhinoceros to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inforce his offensive armament, already dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of his wide jaws. The jaws of a beetle</seg><seg type="columnLine">work from side to side, instead of up and down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this had made the protection complete in no</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than three directions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl inspected the sharp, danger-like instrument</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand. He felt its point, and it pricked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger. He flung it aside as he crept to the hiding-</seg><seg type="columnLine">place of his tribe. There were only twenty of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">four or five men, six or seven women, and the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls and children.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Burl had been wondering at the strange feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings that came over him when he looked at one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girls. She was younger than Burl--perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighteen--and fleeter of foot than he. They talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, sometimes, and once or twice Burl shared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her an especially succulent find of foodstuffs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next mprning he found the horn where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thrown it, sticking in the flabby side of a toad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stool. He pulled it out, and gradually, far back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind, an idea began to take shape. He sat for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time with the thing in his hand, considering it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a far-away look in his eyes. From time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he stabbed at a toadstool, awkwardly, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering skill. His 'imagination began to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitfully. He visualized himself stabbing food with</seg><seg type="columnLine">it as the larger beetle had stabbed the former owner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the weapon in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl could not imagine himself coping with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fighting insects. He could only picture him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, dimly, stabbing something that was food with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this death-dealing thing. It was longer than his</seg><seg type="columnLine">740</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">arm and though clumsy to the hand, an effective and</seg><seg type="columnLine">terribly sharp implement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought. Where was there food, food that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived, that would not fight back? Presently he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose and began to make his way toward the tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. Ydlow-bellied newts swam in its waters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The swimming larvze of a thousand insects floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">about its surface or crawled upon its bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were deadly things there, too. Giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">crayfish snapped their horny claws at the unwary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mosquitoes of four-inch wing-spread sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">made their humming way above the river. The last</seg><seg type="columnLine">survivors of their race, they were dying out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of the plant-juices on which the male of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">species lived, but even so they were formidable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl had learned to crush them with fragments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He crept slowly through the forest of toadstools.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brownish fungus was underfoot. Strange orange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">red, and purple molds clustered about the bases</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the creamy toadstool stalks. Once Burl paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run his sharp-pointed weapon through a fleshy</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalk and reassure himself that what he planned was</seg><seg type="columnLine">practicable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made his way furtively through the forest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">misshapen growths. Once he heard a tiny clicking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and froze into stillness. It was a troop of four or</seg><seg type="columnLine">five ants, each some eight inches long, returning</seg><seg type="columnLine">along their habitual pathway to their city. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved sturdily, heavily laden, along the route</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked with the odorous formic acid exuded from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bodies of their comrades. Burl waited until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had passed, then went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came to the bank of the river. Green scum</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered a great deal of its surface, scum occasionally</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken by a slowly enlarging bubble of some gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">released from decomposing matter on the bottom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the center of the placid stream the current ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little more swiftly, and the water itself was visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over the shining current water-spiders ran swift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. They had not shared in the general increase</seg><seg type="columnLine">of size that had taken place in the insect world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Depending upon the capillary qualities of the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">to support them, an increase in size and weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have deprived them of the means of locomo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the spot where Burl first peered at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water the green scum spread out for many yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the stream. He could not see what swam and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wriggled and crawled beneath the evil-smelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering. He peered up and down the banks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps a hundred and fifty yards below, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current came near the shore. An out-cropping of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock there made a steep descent to the river, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which yellow shelf-fungi stretched out. Dark-red</seg><seg type="columnLine">and orange above, they were light-yellow below, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they formed a series of platforms above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothly flowing stream. Burl made his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously toward them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On his way he saw one of the edible mushrooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">that formed so large a part of his diet, and paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">to break from the flabby flesh an amount that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">feed him for many days. It w^s too often the cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom of his people to find a store of food, carry it to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their hiding-place, and then gorge themselves for</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, eating, sleeping, and waking only to eat again</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the food was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Absorbed as he was in his plan of trying his new</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon, Burl was tempted to return with his booty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would give Saya of this food, and they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat together. Saya was the maiden who roused un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual emotions in Burl. He felt strange impulses</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirring within him when she was near, a desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch her, to caress her. He did not understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went on, after hesitating. If he brought her</seg><seg type="columnLine">food, Saya would be pleased, but if he brought her</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the things that swam in the stream, she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be still more pleased. Degraded as his tribe had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become, Burl was yet a little more intelligent than</seg><seg type="columnLine">they. He was an atavism, a throwback to ancestors</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had cultivated the earth and subjugated its</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals. He had a vague idea of pride, unformed</seg><seg type="columnLine">but potent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No man within memory had hunted or slain for</seg><seg type="columnLine">food. They knew of meat, yes, but it had been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragments left by an insect-hunter, seized and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried away by the men before the perpetually alert</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant-colonies had sent their foragers to the scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Burl did what no man before him had done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he brought a whole carcass to his tribe, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would envy him. They were preoccupied solely</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their stomachs, and after that with the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servation of their lives. The perpetuation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">race came third in their consideration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were herded together in a leaderless group,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming to the same hiding-place that they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">share in the finds of the lucky and gather comfort</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their numbers. Of weapons, they had none.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They sometimes used stones to crack open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs of the huge insects they found partly de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voured, cracking them open for the sweet meat to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be found inside, but they sought safety from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies solely in flight and hiding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their enemies were not as numerous as might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been imagined. Most of the meat-eating in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects have their allotted prey. The sphex--a hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wasp--feeds solely upon grasshoppers. Other</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasps eat fires only. The pirate-bee eats bumble-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bees only. Spiders were the principal enemies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, as they devour with a terrifying impartiality</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that falls into their clutches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl reached the spot from which he might gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the water. He lay prostrate, staring into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shallow depths. Once a huge crayfish, as long</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Burl's body, moved leisurely across his vision.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Small fishes and even the huge newts fled before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voracious creature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a long time the tide of underwater life</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed its activity. The wriggling grubs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragon-flies reappeared. Little flecks of silver swam</seg><seg type="columnLine">into view--a school of tiny fish. A larger fish ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared, moving slowly through the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl's eyes glistened and his mouth watered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He reached down with his long weapon. It barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the water. Disappointment filled him, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearness and the apparent practicability of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme spurred him on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He considered the situation. There were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelf-fungi below him. He rose and moved to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAD PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">741</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">point just above them, then thrust his spear down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They resisted its point. Burl felt them tentatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">■with his foot, then dared to thrust his weight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. They held him firmly. He clambered down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lay flat upon them, peering over the edge as</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The large fish, as long as Burl's arm, swam slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to and fro below him. Burl had seen the former</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner of his spear strive to thrust it into his op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponents, and knew that a thrust was necessary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had tried his weapon upon toadstools--had prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tised with it. When the fish swam below him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust sharply downward. The spear seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bend when it entered the water, and missed its</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark by inches, to Burl's astonishment. He tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grew angry with the fish below him for elud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his efforts to kill it. Repeated strokes had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">it untouched, and it was unwary, and did not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to run away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl became furious. The big fish came to rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly beneath his hand. Burl thrust downward</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all his strength. This time the spear, enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing vertically, did not seem to bend. It went</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight down. Its point penetrated the scales of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swimmer below, transfixing that lazy fish com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An uproar began. The fish, struggling to escape,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Burl, trying to draw it up to his perch, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge commotion. In his excitement Burl did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">observe a tiny ripple some distance away. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster crayfish was attracted by the disturbance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was approaching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The unequal combat continued. Burl hung on</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately to the end of his spear. Then there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tremor in Burl's support, it gave way, and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the stream with a mighty splash. Burl went</seg><seg type="columnLine">under, his eyes open, facing death. And as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank, his wide-open eyes saw waved before him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaping claws of the huge crayfish, large enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sever a limb with a. single stroke of their jagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Black-Bellied Spider</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE opened his mouth to scream, a replica of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrible screams of his grandfather,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized by a black-bellied tarantula years</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, but no sound came forth. Only bubbles</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated to the surface of the water. He beat the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unresisting fluid with his hands--he did not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to swim. The colossal creature approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">leisurely, while Burl struggled helplessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His arms struck a solid object, and grasped it</seg><seg type="columnLine">convulsively. A second later he had swung it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween himself and thc huge crustacean. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shock as the mighty jaws closed upon the cork-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like fungus, then felt himself drawn upward as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crayfish released his hold and the shelf-fungus float-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to the surface. Having given way beneath him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been carried below him in his fall, only to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise within his reach just when most needed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl's head popped above water and he saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger bit of the fungus floating near by. Less se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curely anchored to the rocks of the river-bank than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shelf to which Burl had trusted himself, it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been dislodged when the first shelf gave away. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was larger than the fragment to which Burl clung,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and floated higher in the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl was cool with a terrible self possession. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized it and struggled to draw himself on top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. It tilted as his weight came upon it, and nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">overturned, but he paid no heed. With desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">haste, he clawed with hands and feet until he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw himself clear of the water, of which he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever retain a slight fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he pulled himself upon the furry, orange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown upper surface, a sharp blow struck his foot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crayfish, disgusted at finding only what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it a tasteless morsel in the shelf-fungus, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a languid stroke at Burl's wriggling foot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water. Failing to grasp the fleshy member, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crayfish retreated, disgruntled and annoyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Burl floated down-stream, perched, weapon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less and alone, frightened and in constant danger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a flimsy raft composed of a degenerate fungus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating slowly down the stream of a river in whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters death lurked unseen, upon whose banks was</seg><seg type="columnLine">peril, and above whose reaches danger fluttered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden wings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a long time before he recovered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-possession, and when he did he looked first for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spear. It was floating in the water, still trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixing the fish whose capture had endangered Burl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. The fish now floated with its belly upward, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">life gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So insistent was Burl's instinct for food that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">predicament was forgotten when he saw his prey</seg><seg type="columnLine">just out of his reach. He gazed at it, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth watered, while his cranky craft went down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, spinning slowly in the current. He lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat on the floating fungoid, and strove to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and grasp the end of the spear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The raft tilted and nearly flung him overboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. A little later he discovered that it sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">more readily 011 one side than on the other. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was due, of course, to the greater thickness--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequently greater buoyancy--of the part which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had grown next the rocks of the river-bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl found that if he lay with his head stretch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing above that side, it did not sink into the water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wriggled into this new position, then, and waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the slow revolution of his vessel brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear-shaft near him. He stretched his fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his arm, and touched, then grasped it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later he was tearing strips of flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the side of the fish and cramming the oily</seg><seg type="columnLine">mess into his mouth with great enjoyment. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lost his edible mushroom. That danced upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waves several yards away, but Burl ate con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentedly of what he possessed. He did not worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">about what was before him. That lay in the future,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but suddenly he realized that he was being carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther and farther from Saya, the maiden of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe who caused strange bliss to steal over him</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he contemplated her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thought came to him when he visualized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">delight with which she would receive a gift of part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fish he had caught. He was suddenly stricken</seg><seg type="columnLine">with dumb sorrow. He lifted his head and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">longingly at the river banks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A long, monotonous row of strangely colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungus growths. No healthy green, but pallid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cream-colored toadstools, some bright orange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lavender, and purple molds, vivid carmine "rusts"</seg><seg type="columnLine">742</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and mildews, spreading up the banks from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">turgid slime. The sun was not a ball of fire, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely shone as a bright golden patch in the haze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled sky, a patch whose limits could not be defined</seg><seg type="columnLine">or marked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the faintly pinkish light that filtered down</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air a multitude of flying objects could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen. Now and then a cricket or a grasshopper</seg><seg type="columnLine">made its bullet-like flight from one spot to another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huge butterflies fluttered gayly above the silent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemingly lifeless world. Bees lumbered anxiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, seeking the cross-shaped flowers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster cabbages. Now and then a slender-waisted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow-stomached wasp flew alertly through the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl watched them with a strange indifference.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wasps were as long as himself. The bees, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">end, could match his height. The butterflies ranged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from tiny creatures barely capable of shading his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, to colossal things in the folds of whose wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could have been lost. And above him fluttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragon-flies, whose long, spindle-like bodies were</seg><seg type="columnLine">three times the length of his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl ignored them all. Sitting there, an incon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gruous creature of pink skin and soft brown hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon an orange fungus floating in midstream, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was filled with despondency because the current</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried him forever farther and farther from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain slender-limbed maiden of his tiny tribe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose glances caused an odd commotion in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day went on. Once, Burl saw upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue-green mold that there spread upward from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, a band of large, red, Amazon ants, marching</seg><seg type="columnLine">in orderly array, to raid the city of a colony of</seg><seg type="columnLine">black ants, and carry away the eggs they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">fhid there. The eggs would be hatched, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small black' creatures made the slaves of the bri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gands who had stolen them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Amazon ants can live only by the labor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their slaves, and for that reason are mighty war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors in their world. Later, etched against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steaming mist that overhung everything as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eye could reach, Burl saw strangely shaped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swollen branches rearing themselves from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. He knew what they were. A hard-rinded</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungus that grew upon itself in peculiar mockery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the vegetation that had vanished from the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And again he saw pear-shaped objects above</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of which floated little clouds of smoke. They,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, were fungus growths, puffballs, which when</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched emit what seems a puff of vapor. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have towered above Burl's head, had he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, as the day drew to an end, he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the distance what seemed a range of purple hills.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were tall hills to Burl, some sixty or seventy</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet high, and they seemed to be the agglomeration</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a formless growth, multiplying its organisms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forms upon itself until the whole formed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">irregular, cone-shaped mound. Burl watched them</seg><seg type="columnLine">apathetically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently, he ate again of the oily fish. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste was pleasant to him, accustomed to feed</seg><seg type="columnLine">mostly upon insipid mushrooms. He stuffed him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, though the size of his prey left by far the</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger part still un-eaten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He still held his spear firmly beside him. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him Into trouble, but Burl possessed §</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fund of obstinacy. Unlike most of his tribe, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">associated the spear with the food it had secured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than with the difficulty into which it had led</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. When he had eaten his fill he picked it up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and examined it again. The sharpness of its point</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unimpaired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Burl handled it meditatively, debating whether</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or not to attempt to fish again. The shakiness of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his little raft dissuaded him, and he abandoned the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">idea. Presently he stripped a sinew from the gar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment about his middle and hung the fish about his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">neck with it. That would leave him both hands</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">free. Then he sat cross-legged upon the soggily</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">floating fungus, like a pink-skinned Buddha, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">watched the shores go by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Time had passed, and it was drawing near sun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">set. Burl, never having seen the sun save as a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bright spot in the overhanging haze, did not think</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the coming of night as "sunset." To him it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the letting down of darkness from the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  To-day happened to be an exceptionally bright</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">day, and the haze was not as thick as usual. Far</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the west, the thick mist turned to gold, while</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">, the thicker clouds above became blurred masses of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dull-red. Their shadows seemed like lavender from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the contrast of shades. Upon the still surface of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">river, all the myriad tints and shadings were re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flected with an incredible faithfulness, and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shining tops of the giant mushrooms by the river</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brim glowed faintly pink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dragonflies buzzed over his head in their swift</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and angular flight, the metallic luster of their bodies</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">glistening in the rosy light. Great yellow butter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flies flew lightly above the stream. Here, there, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">everywhere upon the water appeared the shell-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">formed boats of a thousand caddis flies, floating</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon the surface while they might.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Burl could have thrust his hand down into their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cavities and seized the white worms that inhabited</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the strange craft. The huge bulk of a tardy bee</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">droned heavily overhead. Burl glanced upward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and saw the long proboscis and the hairy hinder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">legs with their scanty load of pollen. He saw the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">great, multiple-lensed eyes with their expression of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stupid preoccupation, and even the sting that would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mean death alike for him and for the giant insect,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">should it be used.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The crimson radiance grew dim at the edge of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the world. The purple hills had long been left be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hind. Now the slender stalks of ten thousand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">round-domed mushrooms lined the river-bank, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beneath them spread fungi of all colors, from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rawest red to palest blue, but all now fading slowly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to a monochromatic background in the growing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dusk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The buzzing, fluttering, and the flapping of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">insects of the day died slowly down, while from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a million hiding-places there crept out into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deep night soft and furry bodies of great moths,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">who preened themselves and smoothed their feathery</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">antenna before taking to the air. The strong-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">limbed crickets set up their thunderous noise--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grown gravely bass with the increasing size of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">organs by which the sound was made--and then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there began to gather on the water those slender</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spirals of tenuous mist that would presently blanket</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the stream in a mantle of thin fog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Night fell, ,The clouds above seemed to lower and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAD PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">743</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grow dark. Gradually, now a drop and then a drop,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the languid fall of large, warm raindrops that would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drip from the moisture-laden skies all through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">night began. The edge of the stream became a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">place where great disks of coolly glowing flame</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mushrooms that bordered on the river were</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly phosphoi*escent {Pleurotus phosphor eus)</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shone coldly upon the "rusts" and flake-fungi</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath their feet. Here and there a ball of lam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent flame appeared, drifting idly above the steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, festering earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thirty thousand years before, men had called</seg><seg type="columnLine">them "will-o'-the-wisps," but Burl simply stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, accepting them as he accepted all that passed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only a man attempting to advance in the scale of</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization tries to explain everything that he sees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The savage and the child are most often content</seg><seg type="columnLine">to observe without comment, unless the legends</seg><seg type="columnLine">told by wise folk who are possesed by the itch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge are repeated to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl watched for a long time. Great fireflies</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose beacons lighted up their surroundings for</seg><seg type="columnLine">many yards--fireflies Burl knew to be as long as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear--great fireflies shed their intermittent glows</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the stream. Softly fluttering wings, in great</seg><seg type="columnLine">beats that poured torrents of air upon him, passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">above Burl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air was full of winged creatures. The night</seg><seg type="columnLine">was broken by their cries, by the sound of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible wings, by their cries of anguish and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mating calls. Above him and on all sides the per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistent, intense life of the insect world went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceaselessly, but Burl rocked back and forth upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his frail mushroom boat and wished to weep be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause he was being carried from his tribe, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saya--Saya of the swift feet and white teeth, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shy smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl may have been homesick, "but his principal</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts were of Saya. He had dared greatly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring a gift of fresh meat to her, meat captured</seg><seg type="columnLine">as meat had never been known to be taken by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">member of the tribe. And now he was "being carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lay, disconsolate, upon his floating atom on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water for a great part of the night. It was long</seg><seg type="columnLine">after midnight when the mushroom raft struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently and remained grounded upon a shallow in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the light came in the morning, Burl gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him keenly. He Was some twenty yards from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shore, and the greenish scum surrounded his</seg><seg type="columnLine">now disintegrating vessel. The river had widened</seg><seg type="columnLine">out until the other bank was barely to be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the haze above the surface of the river, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearer shore seemed firm and no more full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangers than the territory his tribe inhabited. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the depth of the water with his spear, then was</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck with the multiple usefulness of that weapon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The water would come but slightly above his ankles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shivering a little with fear, Burl stepped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the water, then made for the bank at the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his speed. He felt a soft something clinging to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of his bare feet. With an access of terror, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran faster, and stumbled upon the shore in a panic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stared down at his foot. A shapeless, flesh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored pad clung to his heel, and, as Burl watched,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it began to swell slowly, while the pink of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrinkled folds deepened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was no more than a leech, sharing in the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">largement nearly all the lower world had under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, but Burl did not know that. He thrust at it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the side of his spear, then scraped frantically</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it, and it fell off, leaving a blotch of blood upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skin where it came away. It lay, writhing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsating upon the ground, and Burl fled from it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found himself in one of the toadstool forests</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which he was familiar, and finally paused,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disconsolately. He knew the nature of the fungus</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth about him, and presently fell to eating. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl the sight of food always produced hunger--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise provision of nature to make up for the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinct to store food, which he lacked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl's heart was small within him. He was far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his tribe, and far from Saya. In the par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lance of this day, it is probable that no more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty miles, separated them, but Burl did not think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of distances. He had come down the river. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a land he had never known or seen. And he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All about him was food. All the mushrooms that</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded him were edible, and formed a store of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sustenance Burl's whole tribe could not have eaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">in many days, but that very fact brought Saya to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind more forcibly. Pie squatted on the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolfing down the insipid mushroom in great gulps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when an idea suddenly came to him with all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of inspiration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would bring Saya here, where there was food,</seg><seg type="columnLine">food in great quantities, and she would be pleased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl had forgotten the large and oily fish that still</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung down his back from the sinew about his neck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but now he rose, and its flapping against him re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded him again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took and fingered it all over, getting his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and himself thoroughly greasy in the process, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could eat no more. The thought of Saya's pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure at the sight of that, too, reinforced his deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With all the immediacy of a child or a savage he</seg><seg type="columnLine">set off at once. lie had come along the bank of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream.

Several times he heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">omnipresent clicking of ants on their multifarious</seg><seg type="columnLine">businesses in the wood, but he could afford to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignore them. They were foragers rather than hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters. He only feared one land of ant, the army-ant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which sometimes travels in hordes of millions, eat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing all that it comes upon. In ages past, when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were tiny creatures not an inch long, even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">largest animals fled from them. Now that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">measured a foot in length, not even the gorged</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiders whose distended bellies were a yard in</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickness, dared offer them battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mushroom-forest came to an end. A cheerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasshopper (Ephigger) munched delicately at some</seg><seg type="columnLine">dainty it had found. Its hind legs were bunched</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath it in perpetual readiness for flight. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster wasp appeared above--as long as Burl him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self--poised aii instant, dropped, and seized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">luckless feaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a struggle, then the grasshopper be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">744</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">came helpless, and the wasp's flexible abdomen</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved delicately. Its sting entered the jointed ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mor of its prey, just beneath the head.

He clambered arduously up steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">slopes and made his way cautiously down their</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther sides. Once he had to climb through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangled mass of mushrooms so closely placed, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, that he had to break them apart with blows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his spear before he could pass, when they shed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him torrents of a fiery-red liquid that rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his greasy breast and sank into the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">(Lactarius deliciosus).</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A strange self-confidence now took possession of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl. He walked less cautiously and more boldly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The mere fact that he had struck something and</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed it provided him with a curious fictitious</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had climbed slowly to the top of a red-clay</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff, perhaps a hundred feet high, slowly eaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">away by the river when it overflowed. Burl could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the river. At some past flood-time it had lapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the base of the cliff on whose edge he walked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though now it came no nearer than a quarter-mile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cliffside was almost covered with shelf-fungi,</seg><seg type="columnLine">large and small, white, yellow, orange, and green, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">indescribable confusion and luxuriance. From a</seg><seg type="columnLine">point halfway up the cliff the inch-thick cable of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider's web stretched down to an anchorage on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground, and the strangely geometrical pattern</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the web glistened evilly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somewhere among the fungi of the cliffside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge creature waited until some unfortunate prey</seg><seg type="columnLine">should struggle helplessly in its monster snare. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider waited in a motionless, implacable patience,</seg><seg type="columnLine">invincibly certain of prey, utterly merciless to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">victims.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl strutted on the edge of the cliff, a silly little</seg><seg type="columnLine">pink-skinned creature with an oily fish slung about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his neck and a draggled fragment of a moth's wing</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his middle. In his hand he bore the long spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a minotaur beetle. He strutted, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">scornfully down upon the whitely shining trap be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low him. He struck mushrooms, and they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen before him. He feared nothing. He strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearlessly along. He would go to Saya and bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to this land where food grew in abundance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sixty paces before him, a shaft sank vertically</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sandy, clayey soil. It was a carefully rounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft, and lined with silk. It went down for per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps thirty feet or more, and there enlarged itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a chamber where the owner and digger of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft might rest. The top of the hole was closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a trap-door, stained with mud and earth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">imitate with precision the surrounding soil. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen eye would have been needed to perceive the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening. But a keen eye now peered out from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny crack, the eye of the engineer of the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground dwelling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eight hairy legs surrounded the body of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature that hung motionless at the top of the silk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined Shaft. A huge misshapen globe formed its</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, colored a dirty brown. Two pairB of ferocious</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mandibles stretched before its fierce mouth parts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two eyes glittered evilly in the darkness of the bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row. And over the whole body spread a rough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mangy fur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a thing of implacable malignance, of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credible ferocity. It was the brown hunting-spider,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the American tarantula {Mygale Hentzii). Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was two feet and more in diameter, and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs, outstretched, would cover a circle three yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">across. It watched Burl, its eyes glistening. Slaver</seg><seg type="columnLine">welled up and dropped from its jaws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Burl strutted forward on the edge of the cliff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffed up with a sense of his own importance. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">white snare of the spinning spider below him im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed him as amusing. He knew the spider would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not leave its web to attack him. He reached down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and broke off a bit of fungus growing at his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where he broke it, it was oozing a soupy liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was full of tiny maggots in a delirium of feast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Burl flung it down into the web, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed as the black bulk of the hidden spider</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung down from its hiding-place to investigate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tarantula, peering from its burrow, quivered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with impatience. Burl drew near, and nearer. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was using his spear as a lever, now, and prying off</seg><seg type="columnLine">bits of fungus to fall down the cliffside into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal web. The spider, below, went leisurely from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one place t,o another, investigating each new missile</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its palpi, then leaving them as they appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifeless and undesirable prey. Burl laughed again</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a particularly large lump of shelf-fungus nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowly missed the black-and-silver figure below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The trap-door fell into place with a faint click, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl whirled about. His laughter turned to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream. Moving toward him with incredible rapid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity, the monster tarantula opened its dripping jaws.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its mandibles gaped wide. The poison fangs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsheathed. The creature was thirty paces away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty paces--ten. It leaped into the air, eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittering, all its eight legs extended to seize, fangs</seg><seg type="columnLine">bared--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl screamed again, and thrust out his arms to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward off the impact of the leap. In his terror, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp upon his spear had become agonized. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear-point shot out and the tarantula fell upon it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nearly a quarter of the spear entered the body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ferocious thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It stuck upon the spear, writhing horribly, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling to reach Burl, who was transfixed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror. The mandibles clashed, strange sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from the beast. Then one of the attenuated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairy legs rasped across Burl's forearm. He gasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ultimate fear and stepped backward--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the cliff gave way beneath him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hurtled downward, still clutching the spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">which held the writhing creature from him. Down</seg><seg type="columnLine">through space, his eyes glassy with panic, the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures--the man and the giant tarantula--fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">together. There was a strangely elastic crash and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crackling. They had fallen into the web beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl had reached the end of terror. He could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more fear-struck. Struggling madly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gummy coils of an immense web, which ever bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">him more tightly, with a wounded creature shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering in agony not a yard from him--yet a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded creature that still strove to reach him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAD PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">745</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">its poison fangs--{Burl had reached the limit of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">panic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He fought like a madman to break the coils about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him. His arms and breast were greasy from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">oily fish, and the-sticlcy web did not adhere to them,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but his legs and body were inextricably fastened by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the elastic threads spread for just such prey as he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He paused a moment, in exhaustion. Then he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saw, five yards away, the silvery and black monster</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">waiting patiently for him to weary himself. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">judged the moment propitious. The tarantula and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the man were one in its eyes, one struggling thing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that had fallen opportunely into its snare. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were moving but feebly now. The spider advanced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">delicately, swinging its huge bulk nimbly along the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">web, paying out a cable after it as it came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Burl's arms were free, because of the greasy coat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing they had received. He waved them wildly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shrieking at the pitiless monster that approached.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The spider paused. Those moving arms suggested</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mandibles that might wound or slap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Spiders take few hazards. This spider was no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">exception to the rule. It drew cautiously near, then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stopped. It's spinnerets became busy, and with one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of its eight legs, used like an arm, it flung a gummy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">silk impartially over both the tarantula and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Burl fought against the descending shroud. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strove to thrust it away, but in vain. In a matter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of minutes he was completely covered in a silken</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cloth that hid even the light from his eyes. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and his enemy, the giant tarantula, were beneath</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the same covering, though the tarantula moved but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weakly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The shower ceased. The wed-spider had decided</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that they were helpless. Then Burl felt the cables</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the web give slightly, as the spider approached to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sting and suck the sweet juices from its prey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Army Ants</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THE web yielded gently as the added weight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the black-bellied spider approached.

Beneath the same silken shroud the taran-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tula writhed in agony upon the point of Burl's spear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It clashed its jaws, shuddering upon the horny</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">barb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Burl was quiet in an ecstasy of terror. He waited</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the poison-fangs to be thrust into him. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knew the process. Pie had seen the leisurely fashion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in which the giant spiders delicately stung their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">prey, then withdrew to wait without impatience for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the poison to do its work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When their victim had ceased to struggle they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drew near again, and sucked the sweet juices from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the body, first from one point and then another,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">until what had so recently been a creature vibrant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with life became a shrunken, withered husk--to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flung from the web at nightfall.

Now only the tarantula moved</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">| feebly. Its body was outlined by a bulge in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">concealing shroud, throbbing faintly as it still strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled with the spear in its vitals. The irregularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded protuberance offered a point of attack for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the web-spider. It moved quickly forward, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stung.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Galvanized into fresh torment by his new</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony, the tarantula writhed in a very hell of pain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its legs, clustered about the spear still fastened into</seg><seg type="columnLine">its body, struck out purposelessly, in horrible ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures of delirious suffering. Burl screamed as one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them touched him and struggled himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His arms and head were free beneath the silken</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheet because of the grease and oil that coated them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He clutched at the threads about him and strove to</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw himself away from his deadly neighbor. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">threads did not break, but they parted one from</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, and a tiny opening appeared. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarantula's attenuated limbs touched him again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the strength of utter panic he hauled himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, and the opening enlarged. Another struggle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Burl's head emerged into the open air, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared down for twenty feet upon an open space al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most carpeted with the chitinous remains of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">present captor's former victims.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl's head was free, and his breast and arms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fish slung over his shoulder had shed its oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him impartially.

The tarantula was no more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuddering now.

In a flash of inspiration, Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood. He reached over his shoulder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped the greasy fish; tore it in a dozen places</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smeared himself with the now rancid exuda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, pushing the sticky threads from his limbs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">oiling the surface from which he had thrust it</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt the web tremble.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinnerets became active and the sticky stuff about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl's feet gave way! He shot out of the open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and fell sprawling, awkwardly and heavily, upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth below, crashing upon the shrunken shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a flying beetle which had fallen into the snare</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had not escaped as he had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl rolled over and over, and then sat up.

The glut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inous stuff from the spider's shroud of silk still</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck to his feet and picked up small objects as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went along. Old ant-gnawed fragments of insect</seg><seg type="columnLine">armour pricked him even through his toughened</seg><seg type="columnLine">soles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked about cautiously and removed them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a dozen steps and had to stop again. Burl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain had been uncommonly stimulated of late. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gotten him into at least one predicament--due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his invention of a spear--but had no less readily</seg><seg type="columnLine">led to his escape from another. But for the reason-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that had led him to use the grease from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fish upon his shoulder in oiling his body when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled out of the spider's snare, he would now</seg><seg type="columnLine">be furnishing a meal for that monster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cautiously, Burl looked all about him. He seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be safe. Then, quite deliberately, he sat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think. It was the first time in his life that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done such a thing. The people of his tribe</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not given to meditation. But an idea had</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck Burl with all the force of inspiration--an</seg><seg type="columnLine">abstract idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he was in difficulties, something within him</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to suggest a way out. Would it suggest an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspiration now? He puzzled over the problem.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Childlike--and savage-like--the instant the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to him he proceeded to test it out. He fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gaze upon his foot, The sharp edges of pebbles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the remains of insect-armour, of a dozen things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt his feet when he walked. They had done so</seg><seg type="columnLine">even since he had been born, but never before had</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet been sticky so that the irritation continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">for more than a single step.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he gazed upon his foot, and waited for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought within him to develop. Meanwhile he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly removed the sharp-pointed fragments, one by</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. Partly coated as they were with the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid gum from his feet, they clung to his fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they had to his feet, except upon those portions</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the oil was thick as before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl's reasoning, before, was simple and of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">primary order. Where oil covered him, the web</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not. Therefore he would coat the rest of him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self with oil. Had he been placed in the same pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicament again, he would have used the same means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of escape. But to apply a bit of knowldge gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one predicament to another difficulty was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he had not yet done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dog may be taught that by pulling on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latch-string of a door he may open it, but the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog coming to a high and close-barred gate with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">latch-string attached will never think of pulling</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this second latch-string. He associates a latch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">string with the opening of the door. The opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a gate is another matter entirely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl had been stirred to one invention by immi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent peril. That is not extraordinary. But to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason in cold blood, as he presently did, that oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his feet would nullify the glue upon his feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">enable him again to walk in comfort--that was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumph. The inventions of savages are essentially</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters of life and death, of food and safety. Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort and luxury are only produced by intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a high order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl, in safety, had added to his comfort. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was truly a more important thing in his develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment than almost any other thing he could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done. He oiled his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an almost infinitesimal problem, but Burl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggles with the mental process of reasoning were</seg><seg type="columnLine">actual. Thirty thousand years before him, a wise</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had pointed out that education is simply train-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in thought, in efficient and effective thinking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl's tribe had been too much preoccupied with</seg><seg type="columnLine">food and mere existence to think, and now Burl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting at the base of a squat toadstool that all but</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealed him, reexemplified Rodin's "Thinker" for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time in many generations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For Burl to reason, that oil upon the soles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet would guard him against sharp stones wa3</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much a triumph of intellect as any masterpiece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of art in the ages before him. Burl was learning</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to think.	j</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood up, walked, and crowed in sheer delight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then paused a moment in awe of his own intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence. Thirty-five miles from his tribe, naked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unarmed, utterly ignorant of fire, of wood, of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons save a spear he had experimented with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day before, abysmally uninformed concerning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very existence of any art or science, Burl stopped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">assure himself that he was very wonderful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pride came to him. He wished to display himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Saya, these things upon his feet, and his spear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But his spear was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With touching faith in the efficacy of this new</seg><seg type="columnLine">pastime, Burl sat promptly down again and knitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAD PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">747</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his brows. Just as a superstitious person, once con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced that by appeal to a favorite talisman he will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be guided aright, will inevitably apply to that talis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man on all occasions, so Burl plumped himself down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These questions were easily answered. Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">was naked. He would search out garments for him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. He was weaponless. He would find himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spear. He was hungry--and would seek food, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was far from his tribe, so he would go to them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Puerile reasoning, of course, but valuable because</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was consciously reasoning, consciously appealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his mind for guidance in difficulty, deliberate</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress from a mental desire to a mental resolution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even in the high civilization of ages before, few</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had really used their brains. The great ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jority of people had depended upon machines and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their leaders to think for them. Burl's tribe-folk</seg><seg type="columnLine">depended on their stomachs. Burl, however, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually developing the habit of.thinking which</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes for leadership and which would be invalu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to his little tribe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood up again and faced up-stream, moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly and cautiously, his eyes searching the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him keenly and his ears alert for the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of danger. Gigantic butterflies, riotous in</seg><seg type="columnLine">coloring, fluttered overhead through the misty</seg><seg type="columnLine">haze. Sometimes a grasshopper hurtled through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air like a projectile, its transparent wings beat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the air frantically. Now and then a wasp sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">by, intent upon its hunting, or a bee droned heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, anxious and worried, striving in a nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowerless world to gather the pollen that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">feed the hive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here and there Burl saw flies of various sorts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somo no larger than his thumb, but others the size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his whole hand. They fed upon the juices that</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripped from the maggot-infested mushrooms, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">filth more to their liking was not at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very far away a shrill roaring sounded faintly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was like a multitude of clickings blended into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single sound, but was so. far away that it did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">impress itself upon Burl's attention. He had all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strictly localized vision of a child. What was*</seg><seg type="columnLine">near was important, and what was distant could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignored. Only the imminent required attention,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Burl was preoccupied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had he listened, he would have realized that army</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants were abroad in countless millions, spreading</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves out in a broad array and eating all they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came upon far more destructively than so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">locusts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Locusts in past ages had eaten all green things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were only giant cabbages and a few such</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenacious rank growths in the world that Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew. The locusts had vanished with civilization</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knowledge and the greater part of mankind, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the army ants remained as an invincible enemy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and insects, and the most of the fungus growths</seg><seg type="columnLine">that covered the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl did not notice the sound, however. He moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, briskly though cautiously, searching with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes for garments, food, and weapons. He con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidently expected to find all of them within a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Surely enough, he found a thicket--if one might</seg><seg type="columnLine">call it so--of edible fungi no more than half a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the spot where he had improvised his Ban-*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dais to protect the soles of his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without especial elation, Burl tugged at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">largest until he had broken off a food supply for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several days. He went on, eating as he did so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">past a broad plain a mile and more across, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken into odd little hillocks by gradually ripen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and suddenly developing mushrooms with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was unfamiliar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The earth seemed to be in process of being pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside by rounded protuberances of which only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tips showed. Blood-red hemispheres seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">forcing aside the earth so they might reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl looked at them curiously, and passed among</seg><seg type="columnLine">them without touching them. They were strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to Burl most strange things meant danger. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">any event, Burl was full of a new purpose now. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished garments and weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above the plain a wasp hovered, a heavy object</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangling beneath its black belly, ornamented by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single red band. It was a wasp--the hairy sand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasp--and it was bringing a paralyzed gray cater-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillar to its burrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl watched it drop down with the speed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sureness of an arrow, pull aside a heavy, flat stone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and descend into the ground. It had a vertical</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft dug down for forty feet or more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It descended, evidently inspected the interior, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, and vanished into the hole again, drag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging the gray worm after it. Burl, marching on</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the broad plain that seemed stricken with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">erupting disease from the number of red pimples</seg><seg type="columnLine">making their appearance, did not know what passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, but observed the wasp emerge again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">busily scratch dirt and stones into the shaft until</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was full.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wasp had paralyzed a caterpillar, taken it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the already prepared burrow, laid an egg upon it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and filled up the entrance. In course of time the egg</seg><seg type="columnLine">would hatch into a grub barely as long as Burl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">forefinger, which would then feed upon the torpid</seg><seg type="columnLine">caterpillar until it had waxed large and fat. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would weave itself a chrysalis and sleep a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep, only to wake as a wasp and dig its way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl reached the farther side of the plain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself threading the aisles of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungus forests in which the growths were hideous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">misshapen travesties upon the trees they had sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planted. Bloated, yellow limbs branched off from</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded, swollen trunks. Here and there a pear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped puff-ball, Burl's height and half as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, waited craftily until a chance touch should</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause it to shoot upward a curling puff of infinitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl went cautiously. There were dangers here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he moved forward steadily, none the less. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">great mass of edible mushroom was slung under</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of his arms, and from time to time he broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">off a fragment and ate of it, while his large eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched this way and that for threats of harm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind him, a high, shrill roaring had grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly in volume and nearness, but was still too</seg><seg type="columnLine">far away to impress Burl. The army ants were</seg><seg type="columnLine">working havoc in the distance. By thousands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions, myriads upon myriads, they were foraging</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country, clambering upon every eminence, des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cending into every depression, their antenna wav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">743</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing restlessly and their mandibles forever threaten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly extended. The ground was black with them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and each was ten inches and more in length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A single such creature would be formidable to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unarmed and naked man like Burl, whose wisest</seg><seg type="columnLine">move would be flight, but in their thousands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions they presented a menace from which no</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape seemed possible. They were advancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily and rapidly, shrill stridulations and a mul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titude of clickings marking their movements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great, helpless caterpillars upon the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabbages heard the sound of their coming, but were</seg><seg type="columnLine">too stupid to flee. The black multitudes covered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rank vegetables, and tiny but voracious jaws began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tear at the flaccid masses of flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each creature had some futile means of strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling. The caterpillars strove to throw off their</seg><seg type="columnLine">innumerable assailants by writhings and contor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, wholly ineffective. The bees fought their en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance to the gigantic hives with stings and wing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beats. The moths took to the air in helpless blind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness when discovered by the relentless throngs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">small black insects which reeked of formic acid and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the ground behind them denuded of every liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the oncoming horde was a world of teem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing life, where mushrooms and fungi fought with</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinning numbers of giant cabbages for foothold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind the black multitude was--nothing. Mush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms, cabbages, bees, wasps, cricket, every creep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and crawling thing that did not get aloft be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the black tide reached it was lost, tom to bits</seg><seg type="columnLine">by tiny mandibles. Even the hunting spiders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarantulas fell before the hosts of insects, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed many in their final struggles, but over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelmed by sheer numbers. And the wounded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying army ants made food for their sound com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rades.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is no mercy among insects. Only the web-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiders sat unmoved and immovable in their colos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sal snares, secure in the knowledge that their</seg><seg type="columnLine">gummy webs would discourage attempts at invasion</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the slender supporting cables.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Surging onward, flowing like a monstrous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">murky tide over the yellow, steaming earth, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">army ants advanced. Their vanguard reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, and recoiled. Burl was perhaps five miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant when they changed their course, communi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cating the altered line of march to those behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in some mysterious fashion of transmitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thirty thousand years before, scientists had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bated gravely over the means of communication</seg><seg type="columnLine">among ants. They had observed that a single ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding a bit of booty too large for him to handle</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone would return to the ant-city and return with</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. From that one instance they deduced a</seg><seg type="columnLine">language of gesture made with the antennas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl had no wise theories. He merely knew facts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he knew that the ants had some form of speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">or transmission of ideas. Now, however, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving cautiously along toward the stamping-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grounds of his tribe, in complete ignorance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black blanket of living creatures creeping over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground toward him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A million tragedies marked the progress of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect army. There was a tiny colony of mining</seg><seg type="columnLine">bees--Zebra bees--a single mother, some four feet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">long, had dug a huge gallery with some ten cells,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which she laid her eggs and fed her grubs with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard-gathered pollen. The grubs had waxed fat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and large, became bees, and laid eggs in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn, within the gallery their mother had dug out</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them./</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten such bulky insects now foraged busily for</seg><seg type="columnLine">grubs within the ancestral home, while the founder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the colony had grown draggled and wingless with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passing of time. Unable to forage, herself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old bee became the guardian of the nest or hive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as is the custom among the mining bees. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the opening of the hive with her head, mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a living barrier within the entrance, and with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing to give entrance and exit only to duly</seg><seg type="columnLine">authenticated members of the colony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ancient and draggled concierge of the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground dwelling was at her post when the wave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">army ants swept over her. Tiny, evil-smelling feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">trampled upon her. She emerged to fight with</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandible and sting for the sanctity of the hive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a moment she was a shaggy mass of biting ants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rending and tearing at her chitinous armour. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">old bee fought madly, viciously, sounding a buzzing</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm to the colonists yet within the hive. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged, fighting as they came, for the gallery lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down was a dark flood of small insects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a few moments a battle such as would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">an epic was in progress. Ten huge bees, each four</seg><seg type="columnLine">to five feet long, fighting with legs and jaw, wing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mandible, with all the ferocity of as many</seg><seg type="columnLine">tigers. The tiny, vicious ants covered them, snap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping at their multiple eyes, biting at the tender</seg><seg type="columnLine">joints in their armour--sometimes releasing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger prey to leap upon an injured comrade wound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed by the huge creature they battled in common.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fight, however, could have but one ending.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Struggle as the bees might, herculean as their ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forts might be, they were powerless against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible numbers of their assailants, who tore them</seg><seg type="columnLine">into tiny fragments and devoured them. Before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last shred of the hive's defenders had vanished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hive itself was gutted alike of the grubs it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained and the food brought to the grubs by</seg><seg type="columnLine">such weary effort of the mature bees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The army ants went on. Only an empty gallery</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained, that and a few fragments of tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">armour, unappetising even to the omnivorous ants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl was meditatively inspecting the scene of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">recent tragedy, where rent and scraped fragments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a great beetle's shiny casing lay upon the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A greater beetle had come upon the first and slain</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Burl was looking upon the remains of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three or four minims, little ants barely six</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches long, foraged industriously among the bits.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A new ant-city was to be formed, and the queen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant lay hidden a half-mile away. These were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first hatchlings, who would feed the larger ants on</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom would fall the great work of the ant-city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl ignored them, searching with his eyes for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear or weapon of some sort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind him the clicking roar, the high-pitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">stridulations of the horde of army ants, rose in</seg><seg type="columnLine">volume. Burl turned disgustedly away. The best</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could find in the way of a weapon was a fiercely</seg><seg type="columnLine">toothed hind-leg.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck it with the leg and crushed it. Two of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other minims appeared, attracted by the noise the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first had made. Discovering the crushed body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fellow, they unceremoniously dismembered it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bore it away in triumph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl went on, swinging the toothed limb in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. It made a fair club, and Burl was accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use stones to crush the juicy legs of such giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">crickets as his tribe sometimes came upon. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed a half-defined idea of a club. The sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth of the thing in his hand made him realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a sidewise blow was better than a spear-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound behind him had become a distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispering, high-pitched, and growing nearer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The army ants swept over a mushroom forest, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yellow, umbrella-like growths swarmed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">black creatures devouring the substance on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they found a foot-hold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A great blue-bottle fly, shining with a metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">luster, reposed in an ecstacy of feasting, sipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">through its long proboscis the dark-colored liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">that dripped slowly from a mushroom.

Burl stood over</seg><seg type="columnLine">it for an instant, pondering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The army ants came nearer, down into a tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley, swarming into and through a little brook</seg><seg type="columnLine">over which Burl had leaped. Ants can remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">under water for a long time without drowning, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">the small stream was but a minor obstacle, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the current of water swept many of them off their</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet until they choked the brook-bed and their com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rades passed over their struggling bodies dry-shod.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were no more than temporarily annoyed how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, and crawled out to resume their march.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About a quarter of a mile to the left of Burl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of march, and perhaps a mile behind the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he stood over the dead blue-bottle fly, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a stretch of an acre or more where the giant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rank cabbages had so far resisted the encroach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of the ever-present mushrooms. The pale,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross-shaped flowers of the cabbages formed food</seg><seg type="columnLine">for many bees, and the leaves fed numberless grubs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and worms, and loud-voiced crickets which crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">about on the ground, munching busily at the succu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent green stuff. The army ants swept into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green area, ceaselessly devouring all they came up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A terrific din arose. The crickets hurtled away</seg><seg type="columnLine">in rocket-like flight, in a dark cloud of wildly-beat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wings. They shot aimlessly in any direction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the result that half, or more that half, fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the midst of the black tide of devouring insects</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were seized as they fell. They uttered terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries as they were being torn to bits. Horrible in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">human screams reached Burl's ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A single such cry of agony would not have at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted Burl's attention--he lived in the very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere of tragedy--but the chorus of crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures in torment made him look up. This was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">minor horror. Wholesale slaughter was going on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He peered anxiously in the direction of the sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A stretch of sickly yellow fungus was here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there interspersed with a squat toadstool or a splash</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vivid color where one of the many "rusts" had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a foothold. To the left a group of awkward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">misshapen fungoids clustered in silent mockery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a forest of trees. There was a mass of faded green,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the giant cabbages stood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the true sun never shining upon them save</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a blanket of thick haze or heavy clouds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were pallid things, hut they were the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">green things Burl had seen. Their nodding white</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers with four petals in the form of a cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed against the yellowish-green leaves. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Burl gazed toward them, the green became slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From where he stood, Burl could see two or three</seg><seg type="columnLine">great grubs in lazy contentment, eating ceaselessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cabbages on which they rested. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">first one and then the other began to jerk spasmo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dically. Burl saw that about each of them a tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">rim of black had clustered. Tiny black motes milled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the green surfaces of the cabbages. The grubs</seg><seg type="columnLine">became black, the cabbages became black. Horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">contortions of the writhing grubs told of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agonies they were enduring. Then a black wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared at the further edge of the stretch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickly yellow fungus, a glistening, living wave, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved forward rapidly with the the roar of click-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings and a persistent overtone of shrill stridula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hair rose upon Burl's head. He knew what</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was! He knew all too well the meaning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that tide of shining bodies. With a gasp of terror,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his intellectual preoccupations forgotten, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and fled in ultimate panic. And the tide</seg><seg type="columnLine">came slowly on after him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Red Death</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE flung away the great mass of edible mush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, but clung to his sharp-toothed club</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately, and darted through the tangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">aisles of the little mushroom forest with a heedless</seg><seg type="columnLine">disregard of the dangers that might await him</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Flies buzzed about him loudly, huge crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, glittering with a metallic luster.

In Burl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the flies had not great heaps of putrid matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which to lay their eggs. The ants--busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">scavengers--carted away the debris of the mul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titudinous tragedies of the insect world long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could acquire the gamey flavor beloved by the fly</seg><seg type="columnLine">maggots. Only in isolated spots were the flies</seg><seg type="columnLine">really numerous, but there they clustered in clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">that darkened the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such a buzzing, whirling cloud surrounded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">madly-running figure of Burl. It seemed as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">a miniature whirlwind kept pace with the little pink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skinned man, a whirlwind composed of winged</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies and multi-faceted eyes. He twirled his club</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him, and almost every stroke was interrupted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by an -.mpact against a thinly-armoured body which</seg><seg type="columnLine">collapsed with a spurting of reddish liquid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An agonizing pain as of a red-hot iron struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Burl's back. One of the stinging flies had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust its sharp-tipped proboscis into Burl's flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">to suck the blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl uttered a cry and--ran full tilt into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick stalk of a blackened and draggled toadstool.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a curious crackling as of wet punk or</seg><seg type="columnLine">brittle, rotten wood. The toadstool collapsed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself with a strange splashing sound. Many flies</seg><seg type="columnLine">had laid their eggs in the fungoid, and it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeming mass of corruption and ill-smelling liquid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the crash of the toadstool's "head" upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, it fell into a dozen pieces, and the earth for</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards around was spattered with a stinking liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which tiny, headless maggots twitched convul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The buzzing of the flies took on a note of satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faction, and they settled by hundreds about the edges</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ill-smelling pools, becoming lost in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecstacy of feasting while Burl staggered to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and darted off again. This time he was but a minor</seg><seg type="columnLine">attraction to the flies, and but one or two came near</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. From every direction they were hurrying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the toadstool feast, to the banquet of horrible lique-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied fungus that lay spread upon the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl ran on. He passed beneath the wide-spread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing leaves of a giant cabbage. A great grass-hop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per crouched upon the ground, its tremendous jaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">crunching the rank vegetation voraciously. Half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen great worms ate steadily from their resting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">places among the leaves. One of them slung itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath an over-hanging leaf--which would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">thatched a dozen homes for as many men--and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">placidly anchoring itself in preparation for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinning of a cocoon in which to sleep the sleep of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metamorphosis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A mile away, the great black tide of army ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">was advancing relentlessly. The great cabbage, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge grasshopper, and all the stupid caterpillars up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the wide leaves would soon be covered with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny, biting insects. The cabbage would be reduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a chewed and destroyed stump, the colossal, furry</seg><seg type="columnLine">grubs would be torn into a myriad mouthfuls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoured by the black army ants, and the grass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopper would strike out with terrific, unguided</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength, crushing its assailants by blows of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful hind-legs and bites of its great jaws. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would die, making terrible sounds of torment as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vicious mandibles of the army ants found</seg><seg type="columnLine">crevices in its armour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clicking roar of the ants' advance oversha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dowed all other sound now. Burl was running</seg><seg type="columnLine">madly, his breath coming in great gasps, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide with panic. Alone of all the world about him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew the danger behind. The insects he passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">were going about their business with that terrify-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing efficiency found only in the insect world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is something strangely daunting in the ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of an insect. It moves so directly, with such</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncanny precision, with such utter indifference to</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything but the end in view. Cannibalism is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rule, almost without exception. The paralysis of</seg><seg type="columnLine">prey, so it may remain alive and fresh--though in</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony--for weeks on end, is a common practice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The eating piecemeal of still-living victims is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Absolute mercilessness, utter callousness, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credible inhumanity beyond anything known in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal world is the natural and commonplace</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice of the insects. And these vast cruelties</seg><seg type="columnLine">are performed by armoured, machine-like creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an abstraction and a routine air that suggests</seg><seg type="columnLine">a horrible Nature behind them all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl nearly stumbled upon a tragedy. He passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a dozen yards of a space where a female</seg><seg type="columnLine">dung-beetle was devouring the mate whose honey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon had begun that same day and ended in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gruesome fashion. Hidden behind a clump of mush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms, a great yellow-banded spider was coyly</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening a smaller male of her own species. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was discreetly ardent, but if he won the favor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gruesome creature he was wooing, he would fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nish an appetizing meal for her some time within</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-four hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl's heart was pounding madly. The breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistled in his nostrils--and behind him, the wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">of army ants was drawing nearer. They came upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feasting flies. Some took to the air and escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">but others were too engrossed in their delicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal. The twitching little maggots, stranded upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth by the scattering of their soupy broth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were torn in pieces. The flies who were seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished into little maws. The serried ranks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">black insects went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tiny clickings of their limbs, the perpetual</seg><seg type="columnLine">challenges and cross-challenges of crossed antenna;,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stridulations of the creatures, all combined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a high-pitched but deafening din. Now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then another sound pierced the noises made by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants themselves. A cricket, seized by a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny jaws, uttered cries of agony. The shrill note</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crickets had grown deeply bass with the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crease in size of the organs that uttered it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a strange contrast between the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the advancing horde and that immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind it. Before, a busy world, teeming with life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Butterflies floating overhead on lazy wings, grubs</seg><seg type="columnLine">waxing fat and huge upon the giant cabbages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crickets eating, great spiders sitting quietly in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lairs waiting with invincible patience for prey to</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw near their trap-doors or fall into their webs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal beetles lumbering heavily through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mushroom forests, seeking food, making love in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the monstrous, tragic fashion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And behind the wide belt of army ants--chaos.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The edible mushrooms gone. The giant cabbages</seg><seg type="columnLine">left as mere stumps of unappetizing pulp, the busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">life of the insect world completely wiped out save</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAD PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">751</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for the flying creatures that fluttered helplessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">over an utterly changed landscape. Here and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">little bands of stragglers moved busily over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">denuded earth, searching for some fragment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">food that might conceivably have been overlooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the main body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl was putting forth his last ounce of strength.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His limbs trembled, his breathing was agony, sweat</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood out upon his forehead. He ran, a little, naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with the disjointed fragment of a huge in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sect's limb in his hand, running for his insignifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cant life, running as if his continued existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the million tragedies of that single day were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purpose for which the universe had been created.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sped across an open space a hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">across. A thicket of beautifully golden mushrooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">(Agaricus coelareus) barred his way. Beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mushrooms a range of strangely colored hills began,</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple and green and black and gold, melting into</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other, branching off from each other, inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricably tangled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They rose to a height of perhaps sixty or seventy</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, and above them a little grayish haze had gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered. There seemed to be a layer of tenuous vapor</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon their surfaces, which slowly rose and coiled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gathered into a tiny cloudlet above their tips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hills, themselves, were but masses of fungus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mushrooms and rusts, fungoids of every descrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, yeasts, "musts," and every form of fungus</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth which had grown within itself and about</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself until this great mass of strangely colored,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spongy stuff had gathered in a mass that undulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">unevenly across the level earth for miles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl burst through the golden thicket and attacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ascent. His feet sank into the spongy sides of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hillock. Panting, gasping, staggering from ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haustion, he made his way up the top. He plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a little valley on the farther side, up another</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope. For perhaps ten minutes he forced himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, then collapsed. He lay, unable to move further,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a little hollow, his sharp-toothed club still clasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hands. Above him, a bright yellow butterfly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a thirty-foot spread of wings fluttered lightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lay motionless, breathing in great gasps, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs refusing to lift him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound of the army ants continued to grow</seg><seg type="columnLine">near. At last, above the crest of the last hillock</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had surmounted, two tiny antenna* appeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the black, glistening head of an army ant, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forerunner of its horde. It moved deliberately for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, waving it antennee ceaselessly. It made its</seg><seg type="columnLine">way toward Burl, tiny clickings coming from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements of its limbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little wisp of tenuous vapor swirled toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant, a wisp of the same vapor that had gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the whole range of hills as a thin, low cloud. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">enveloped the insect--and the ant seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacked by a strange convulsion. Its legs moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">aimlessly. It threw itself desperately about. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been a animal, Burl would have watched with</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering eyes while it coughed and gasped, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an insect breathing through air-holes in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">abdomen. It writhed upon the spongy fungus</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth across which it had been moving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl, lying in an exhausted, panting heap upori</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purple mass of fungus, was conscious of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange sensation. His body felt strangely warm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew nothing of fire or the heat of the sun, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the only sensation of warmth he had ever known</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that caused when the members of his tribe</seg><seg type="columnLine">had huddled together in their hiding place when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">damp chill of the night had touched their soft-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slcinned bodies. Then the heat of their breath and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bodies had kept out the chill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This heat that Burl now felt was a hotter, fiercer</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat. He moved his body with a tremendous effort,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for a moment the fungus was cool and soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath him. Then, slowly the sensation of heat be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan again, increased until Burl's skin was red</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inflamed from the irritation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The . thin and tenuous vapor, too, made Burl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs smart and his eyes water. He was breathing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in great, choky gasps, but the period of rest--short</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it was--had enabled him to rise and stagger on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He crawled painfully to the top of the slope, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hill-crest on which he stood was higher than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of those he had passed in his painful run, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see clearly the whole of the purple range.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where he was, he stood near the farther edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">range, which was here perhaps half a mile wide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a ceaseless, undulating mass of hills and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollows, ridges and spurs, all of them colored, pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple and brown and golden-yellow, deepest black and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dingy white. And from the tips of most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed hills little wisps of vapor rose up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A thin, dark cloud had gathered overhead. Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">could look to the right and left and see the hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">fading into the distance, growing fainter as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">haze above them seemed to grow thicker. He saw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, the advancing cohorts of the army ants, creep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over the tangled mass of fungus growth. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be feeding as they went, upon the fungus</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had gathered into these incredible monstros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hills were living. They were not upheavals</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ground, they were festering heaps of insanely</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing, festering mushrooms and fungus. Upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of them a purple mould had spread itself so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they seemed a range of purple hills, but here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there patches of other vivid colors showed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a large hill whose whole side was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant golden hue. Another had tiny bright-red</seg><seg type="columnLine">spots of a strange and malignant mushroom whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">properties Burl did not know, scattered all over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple with which it was covered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl leaned heavily upon his club and watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">dully. He could run no more. The army ants were</seg><seg type="columnLine">spreading everywhere over the mass of fungus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would reach him soon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far to the right the vapor thickened. A column</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smoke arose. What Burl did not know and would,</seg><seg type="columnLine">never know was that far down in the interior of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that compressed mass of fungus, slow oxidation</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been going on. The temperature of the interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been raised. In the darkness and the dampness</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep down in the hills, spontaneous combustion had</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just as the vast piles of coal the railroad com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panies of thirty thousand years before had gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">together sometimes began to burn fiercely in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">interiors, and just as the farmers' piles of damp</seg><seg type="columnLine">straw or hay suddenly burst into fierce flames from</seg><seg type="columnLine">no cause, so these huge piles of tinder-like mush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms had been burning slowly within themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There had been no flames, because the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">752</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">remained intact and nearly air-tight. But when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the army ants began to tear at the edible surfaces</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite the heat they encountered, fresh air found</seg><seg type="columnLine">its way to the smouldering masses of fungus. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow combustion became rapid combustion. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull heat became fierce flames. The slow trickle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin smoke became a huge column of thick, chok-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, acrid stuff that set the army ants that breathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it into spasms of convulsive writhing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From a dozen points the flames burst out. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen or more columns of blinding smoke rose to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens. A pall of fume-laden smoke gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the range of purple hills, while Burl watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">apathetically. And the serried ranks of army ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">marched on to the widening furnaces that awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had recoiled from the river, because their</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinct had warned them. Thirty thousand years</seg><seg type="columnLine">without danger from fire, however, had let their</seg><seg type="columnLine">racial fear of fire die out. They marched into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing orifices they had opened in the hills, snap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping with their mandibles at the leaping flames,</seg><seg type="columnLine">springing at the glowing tinder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blazing areas widened, as the purple surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">was undermined and fell in. Burl watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomenon without comprehension and even with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out thankfulness. He stood, panting more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more slowly, breathing more and more easily, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glow from the approaching flames reddened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin and the acrid smoke made tears flow from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he retreated slowly, leaning on his club and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking back. The black wave of the army ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sweeping into the fire, sweeping into the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credible heat of that carbonized material burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an open flame. At last there were only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little bodies of stragglers from the great ant-army,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scurrying here and there over the ground their</seg><seg type="columnLine">comrades had denuded of all living things. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies of the main army had vanished--burnt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">crisp ashes in the furnace of the hills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There had been agony in that flame, dreadful</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony such as no man would like to dwell upon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The insane courage of the ants, attacking with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">horny jaws the burning masses of fungus, rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and over with a flaming missile clutched in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their mandibles, sounding their shrill war-cry while</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries of agony came from them--blinded, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">antennae burnt off, their lidless eyes scorched by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">licking flames, yet going madly forward on flaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet to attack, ever attack this unknown and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowable enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl made his way slowly over the hills. Twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw small bodies of the army ants. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed between the widening surfaces their com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rades had opened, and they were feeding voraciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the hills they trod on. Once Burl was spied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a shrill war-cry was sounded, but he moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, and the ants were busily eating. A single ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed toward him. Burl brought down his club</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a writhing body remained, to be eaten later by</seg><seg type="columnLine">its comrades when they came upon it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again night fell. The sky grew red in the west,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the sun did not shine through the ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">present cloud bank. Darkness spread across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. Utter blackness fell over the whole mad world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">save where the luminous mushrooms shed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale light upon the ground and fireflies the length</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of Burl's arm shed their fitful gleams upon an earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fungus growths and monstrous insects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl made his way across the range of mush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room hills, picking his path with his large blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes whose pupils expanded to great size. Slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the sky, now a drop and then a drop, now a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop and then a drop, the nightly rain that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue until daybreak began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl found the ground hard beneath his feet. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened keenly for sounds of danger. Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustled heavily in a thicket of mushrooms a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred yards away. There were sounds of preening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of delicate feet placed lightly here and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the ground. Then the throbbing beat of huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings began suddenly, and a body took to the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fierce, down-coming current of air smote Burl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he looked upward in time to catch the outline</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a huge body--a moth--as it passed above him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned to watch the line of its flight, and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange glow in the sky behind him. The mush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room hills were still burning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He crouched beneath a squat toadstool and waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the dawn, his club held tightly in his hands, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears alert for any sound of danger. The slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping, sodden rain kept on. It fell with irre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gular, drum-like beats upon the tough top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">toadstool under which he had taken refuge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly, slowly, the sodden rainfall continued.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drop by drop, all the night long, the warn pellets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of liquid came from the sky. They boomed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hollow heads of the toadstools, and splashed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the steaming pools that lay festering all over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungus-covered earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And all the night long the great fires grew and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread in the mass of already half-carbonized mush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. The flare at the horizon grew brighter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer. Burl, naked and hiding beneath a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">mushroom, wondering, with wide eyes, what this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was, watched it grow near him. He had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen a flame before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The overhanging clouds were brightened by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames. Over a stretch at least a dozen miles in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length and from half a mile to three miles across,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seething furnaces sent columns of dense smoke up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the roof of clouds, luminous from the glow be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low them, and spreading out and forming an inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediate layer below the cloudbanks themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wras like the glow of all the many lighls of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast city thrown against the sky--but the last great</seg><seg type="columnLine">city had moulded into fungus-covered rubbish thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand years before. Like the flitting of air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes above a populous city, too, was the flitting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinated creatures above the glow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moths and great flying beetles, gigantic gnats</seg><seg type="columnLine">and midges, grown huge with the passing of time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they fluttered and danced the dance of death above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flames. As the fire grew nearer to Burl, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Colossal, delicately-formed creatures swooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the strange blaze. Moths with their riotously-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored wings of thirty-foot spread beat the air with</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty strokes, and their huge eyes glowed like</seg><seg type="columnLine">carbuncles as they stared with the frenzied gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">of intoxicated devotees into the glowing flames be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl saw a great peacock moth soaring above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning mushroom hills. Its wings were all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty feet across, and fluttered like gigantic sails</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAD PLANET.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">753</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as the moth gazed down at the flaming furnace be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. The separate flames had united, now, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single sheet of white-hot burning stuff spread across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country for miles, sending up its clouds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke, in which and through which the fascinated</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures flew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Feathery antennse of the finest lace spread out</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the head of the peacock moth, and its body</seg><seg type="columnLine">was softest, richest velvet. A ring of snow-white</seg><seg type="columnLine">down marked where its head began, and the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow from below smote on the maroon of its body</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a strange effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For one instant it was outlined clearly. Its eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed more redly than any ruby's fire, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great, delicate wings were poised in flight. Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the flash of the flumes upon two great irides-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent spots upon the wide-spread wings. Shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple and vivid red, the glow of opal and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheen of pearl, all the glory of chalcedony and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chrysoprase formed a single wonder in the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare of burning fungus. White smoke compassed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great moth all about, dimming the radiance of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorgeous dress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl saw it dart straight into the thickest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightest of the licking flames, flying madly, eagerly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the searing, hellish heat as a willing, drunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrifice to the god of fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Monster flying beetles with their horny wing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases stiffly stretched, blundered above the reeking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking pyre. In the red light from before them</seg><seg type="columnLine">they shone like burnished metal, and their clumsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies with the spurred and fierce-toothed limbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted like so many grotesque meteors through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous haze of ascending smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl saw strange collisions and still stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">meetings. Male and female flying creatures cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cled and spun in the glare, dancing their dance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">love and death in the wild radiance from the funeral</seg><seg type="columnLine">pyre of the purple hills. They mounted higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Burl could see, drunk with the ecstacy of liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, then descended to plunge headlong to death in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roaring fires beneath them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From every side the creatures came. Moths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightest yellow with soft and furry bodies pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitant with life flew madly into the column of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">that reached to the overhanging clouds, then moths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of deepest black with gruesome symbols upon their</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings came swiftly to dance, like motes in sunlight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the glow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Burl sat crouched beneath an overshadowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">toadstool and watched, Thc perpetual, slow, sod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den raindrops fell. A continual faint hissing pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated the sound of the fire--the raindrops being</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to steam. The air was alive with flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. From far away Burl heard a strange, deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">bass muttering. He did not know the cause, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a vast swamp, of the existence of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was ignorant, some ten or fifteen miles away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the chorus of insect-eating giant frogs reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears even at that distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night wore on, while the flying creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the fire danced and died, their numbers ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">recruited by fresh arrivals. Burl sat tensely still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wide eyes watching everything, his mind grop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for an explanation of what he saw. At last the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky grew dimly gray, then brighter, and day came</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. The flames of the burning hills grew faint as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire died down, and after a long time Burl crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his hiding-place and stood erect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hundred yards from where he was, a straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of smoke rose from the still smoldering fungus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Burl could see it stretching for miles in either</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction. He turned to continue on his way, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the remains of one of the tragedies of the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A huge moth had flown into the flames, been hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribly scorched, and floundered out again. Had it</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able to fly, it would have returned to its de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vouring deity, but now it lay immovable upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, its antenna* seared hopelessly, one beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful, delicate wing burned in gaping holes, its eyeg</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimmed by flame and its exquisitely tapering limbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken and crushed by the force with which it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the ground. It lay helpless upon the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the stumps of its antennse moving restlessly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its abdomen pulsating slowly as it drew pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">racked breaths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl drew near and picked up a stone. He moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">on presently, a velvet cloak cast over his shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming with all the colors of the rainbow. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorgeous mass of soft, blue moth fur was about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle, and he had bound upon his forehead two</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard-long, golden fragments of the moth's magnifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent antennae. He strode on slowly, clad as no man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been clad in all the ages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a little he secured a spear and took up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey to Saya, looking like a prince of Ind upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bridal journey--though no mere prince ever wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">such raiment in days of greatest glory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Conqueror</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR many long miles Burl threaded his way}</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a single forest of thin-stalked toad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stools. They towered three man-heights high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all about their bases were streaks and splashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rusts and molds that preyed upon them*</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twice Burl came to open glades, wherein open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubbling pools of green sfirae festered in corruption,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and once he hid himself fearfully as a monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarabeus beetle lumbered within three yards of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, moving heavily onward with a clanking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs as of some mighty machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl saw the mighty armor and the inward-curv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing jaws of the creature, and envied him his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons. The time was not yet come, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Burl would smile at the great insect and hunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for the juicy flesh contained in those armored</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl was still a savage, still ignorant, still timid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His principal advance had been that whereas he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fled without reasoning, he now paused to see if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">need flee. In his hands he bore a long, sharp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed, chitinous spear. It had been the weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a huge, unnamed flying insect scorched td</seg><seg type="columnLine">death in the burning of the purple hills, which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">floundered out of the flames to die. Burl had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked for an hour before being able to detach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weapon he coveted.

A mass of soft and beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">754</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful moth fur was about his middle, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strip of sinew about his waist the fiercely toothed</seg><seg type="columnLine">limb of a fighting beetle was thrust carelessly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had bound to his forehead twin sacks of a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">moth's feathery golden antennas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Against the play of color that came from his bor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowed plumage his pink skin showed in odd con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trast.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was still a fearful creature, no more than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous creatures about him save in the posses-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of latent intelligence. He was weak--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">therein lay his greatest promise. A hundred thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand years before him his ancestors had been forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">by lack of claws and fangs to develop brains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl was sunk as low as they had been, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to combat more horrifying enemies, more inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orable threatenings, and many times more crafty</seg><seg type="columnLine">assailants. His ancestors had invented knives and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears and flying missiles. The creatures about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl had knives and spears a thousand times more</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly than the weapons that had made his ances-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors masters of the woods and forests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl was in comparison vastly more weak than</seg><seg type="columnLine">his forbears had been, and it was that weakness</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in times to come would lead him and those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who followed him to heights his ancestors had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">known. But now--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard a discordant, deep bass bellow, coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a spot not twenty yards away. In a flash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic he darted behind a clump of the mushrooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hid himself, panting in sheer terror. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited for an instant in frozen fear, motionless and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense. His wide, blue eyes were glassy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bellow came again, but this time with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">querulous note. Burl heard a crashing and plunging</seg><seg type="columnLine">as of some creature caught in a snare. A mush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room fell with a brittle snapping, and the spongy</seg><seg type="columnLine">thud as it fell to the ground was followed by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous commotion. Something was fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately against something else, but Burl did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know what creature or creatures might be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">combat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waited for a long time, and the noise gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally died away. Presently Burl's breath came more</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, and his courage returned. He stole from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding-place, and would .have made away, but some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing held him back. Instead of creeping from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene, he crept cautiously over toward the source of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He peered between two cream-colored toadstool</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalks and saw the cause of the noise. A wide, fun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel-shaped snare of silk was spread out before him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some twenty yards across and as many deep. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual threads could be plainly seen, but in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass it seemed a fabric of sheerest, finest texture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Held up by the tall mushrooms, it was anchored to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground below, and drew away to a tiny point</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which a hole gave on some yet unknown re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess. And all the space of the wide snare was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung with threads, fine, twisted threads no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than half the thickness of Burl's finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was the trap of a labyrinth spider. Not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the interlacing threads was strong enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold the feeblest of prey, but the threads were there</seg><seg type="columnLine">by thousands. A great cricket had become en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangled in the maze of sticky lines. Its limbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrashed out, smashing the snare-lines at every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stroke, but at every stroke meeting and becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">entangled with a dozen more. It thrashed about</seg><seg type="columnLine">mightily, emitting at intervals the horrible, deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">bass cry that the chirping voice of the cricket had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become with its increase in size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl breathed more easily, and watched with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinated curiosity. Mere death--even tragic</seg><seg type="columnLine">death--as among insects held no great interest for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. It was a matter of such common and matter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">of-fact occurrence that he was not greatly stirred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But a spider and his prey was another matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were few insects that deliberately sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Most insects have their allotted victims, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">will touch no others, but spiders have a terrifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">impartiality. One great beetle devouring another</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a matter of indifference to Burl. A spider de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vouring some luckless insect was but an example</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what might happen to him. He watched alertly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gaze travelling from the emmeshed cricket to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange orifice at the rear of the funnel-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">snare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The opening darkened. Two shining, glistening</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes had been watching from the rear of the fun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel. It drew itself into a tunnel there, in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spider had been waiting. Now it swung out</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly and came toward the cricket. It was a gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider (Agelena labyrintkica), with twin black rib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bons upon its thorax, next the head, and with two</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripes of curiously speckled brown and white upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">its abdomen. Burl saw, too, two curious appendages</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a tail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It came nimbly out of its tunnel-like hiding-place</seg><seg type="columnLine">and approached the cricket. The cricket was strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling only feebly now, and the cries it uttered were</seg><seg type="columnLine">but feeble, because of the confining threads that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fettered its limbs. Burl saw the spider throw itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the cricket and saw the final, convulsive shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der of the insect as the spider's fangs pierced its</seg><seg type="columnLine">tough armor. The sting lasted a long time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally Burl saw that the spider was really feeding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the succulent juices of the now dead cricket were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being sucked from its body by the spider. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stung the cricket upon the haunch, and presently it</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the other leg and drained that, too, by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its powerful internal suction-pump. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second haunch had been sucked dry, the spider</seg><seg type="columnLine">pawed the lifeless creature for a few moments and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Food was plentiful, and the spider could afford</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be dainty in its feeding. The two choicest titbits</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been consumed. The remainder could be dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">carded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden thought came to Burl and quite took his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath away. For a second his knees knocked to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether in self-induced panic. He watched the gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider carefully, with growing determination in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. He, Burl, had killed a hunting-spider upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red-clay cliff. True, the killing had been an</seg><seg type="columnLine">accident, and had nearly cost him his own life a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes later in the web-spider's snare, but he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed a spider, and of the most deadly kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, a great ambition was growing in Burl'S</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. His tribe had always feared spiders too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to know much of their habits, but they knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or two things. The most important was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snare-spiders never left their lairs to hunt-^</seg><seg type="columnLine">never! Burl was about to make a daring applica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of that knowledge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAD PL'ANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">755</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ho drew back from the white and shining snare</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crept softly to the rear. The fabric gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself into a point and then continued for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty feet as a tunnel, in which the spider waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">while dreaming of its last meal and waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next victim to become entangled in the laby-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rinth in front. Burl made his way to a point where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel was no more than ten feet away, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently, through the interstices of the silk, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the gray bulk of the spider. It had left the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted body of the cricket, and returned to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting-place. It settled itself carefully upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft walls of the tunnel, w'ith its shining eyes fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the tortuous threads of its trap. Burl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair was standing straight up upon his head from</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer fright, but he was the slave of an idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drew near and poised his spear, his new and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp spear, taken from the body of an unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying creature killed by the burning purple hills.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl raised the spear and aimed its sharp and</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly point at the thick gray bulk he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly through the threads of the tunnel. He thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">it home with all his strength--and ran away at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of his speed, glassy-eyed from terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A long time later he ventured near again, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart in his mouth, ready to flee at the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound. All was still. Burl had missed the hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible convulsions of the wounded spider, had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the frightful gnashings of its fangs as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">gnashed at the piercing weapon, had not seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silken threads of the tunnel ripped and torn as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider--hurt to death--had struggled with insane</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength to free itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came back beneath the overshadowing toad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stools, stepping quietly and cautiously, to find a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great rent in the silken tunnel, to find the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray bulk lifeless and still, half-fallen through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening the spear had first made. A little puddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of evil-smelling liquid lay upon the ground below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body, and from time to time a droplet fell from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spear into the puddle with a curious splash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl looked at what he had done, saw the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of the creature he had slain, saw the ferocious</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandibles, and the keen and deadly fangs. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead eyes of the creature still stared at him malig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nantly, and the hairy legs were still braced as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">further to enlarge, the gaping hole through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had partly fallen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Exultation filled Burl's heart. His tribe had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">but furtive vermin for thousands of years, fleeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the mighty insects, and, hiding from them, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtaken, but waiting helplessly for death, scream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing shrilly in terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He, Burl, had turned the tables. He had slain</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the enemies of his tribe. His breast ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panded. Always his tribesmen went quietly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearfully, making no sound. But a sudden, exul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant yell burst from Burl's lips--the first hunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry from the lips of a man in a hundred centuries!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next second his pulse nearly stopped in sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic at having made such a noise. He listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearfully, but there was no sound. He drew near</seg><seg type="columnLine">his prey and carefully withdrew his spear. The vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cid liquid made it slimy and slippery, and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wipe it dry against a leathery toadstool. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl had 'to conquer his logical fear again before</seg><seg type="columnLine">daring to touch the creature he had slain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved off presently, with the belly of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider upon his back and two of the hairy legs over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulders. The other limbs of the monster hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">limp, and trailed upon the ground. Burl was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">a still more curious sight as a gayly colored object</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a cloak shining in iridescent colors, the golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">antennse of a great moth rising from his forehead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the hideous bulk of a gray spider for a burden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved through the thin-stalked mushroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest, and because of the thing he carried all crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures fled before him. They did not fear man--</seg><seg type="columnLine">their instinct was slow-moving--but during all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions of years that insects have existed, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">have existed spiders to prey upon them. So Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved on in solemn state, a brightly clad man bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the weight of a huge and horrible monster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came upon a valley full of torn and blackened</seg><seg type="columnLine">mushrooms. There was not a single yellow top</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them. Every one had been infested with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny maggots which had liquefied the tough meat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mushroom and caused it to drip to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground below. And all the liquid had gathered in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden pool in the center of the small depression.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl heard a loud humming and buzzing before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">topped the rise that opened the valley for his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spection. He stopped a moment and looked down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A golden-red lake, its center reflecting the hazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky overhead. All about, blackened mushrooms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming to have been charred and burned by a fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame. A slow-flowing golden brooklet trickled</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly over a rocky ledge, into the larger pool. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about the edges of the golden lake, in ranks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rows, by hundreds, thousands, and by millions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'ere ranged the green-gold, shining bodies of great</seg><seg type="columnLine">flies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were small as compared with the other in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects. They had increased in size but a fraction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amount that the bees, for example, had in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased ; but it was due to an imperative necessity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flesh-flies iaid their eggs by hundreds in de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caying carcasses. The others laid their eggs by hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds in the mushrooms. To feed the maggots that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would hatch, a relatively great quantity of food</seg><seg type="columnLine">was needed, therefore the flies must remain com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratively small, or the body of a single grasshop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per, say, would furnish food for but two or three</seg><seg type="columnLine">grubs instead of the hundreds it must support.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl stared down at the golden pool. Bluebottles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">greenbottles, and all the flies of metallic luster were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered at the Lucullan feast of corruption. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">buzzing as they darted above the odorous pool of</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden liquid made the sound Burl had heard. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies flashed and glittered as they darted back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth, seeking a place to alight and join in the orgy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those which clustered about the banks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pool were still as if carved from metal. Their huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">red eyes glowed, and their bodies shone with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">obscene fatness. Flies are the most digusting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all insects. Burl watched them a moment, watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interlacing streams of light as they buzzed</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly above the pool, seeking a place at the festive</seg><seg type="columnLine">board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A drumming roar sounded in the air. A golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">speck appeared in the sky, a slender, needlelike body</seg><seg type="columnLine">with transparent, shining wings and two huge eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It grew nearer and became a dragon-fly twenty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more in length, its body shimmering, purest</seg><seg type="columnLine">766</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gold. It poised itself above thc pool and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted down. Its jaws snapped viciously and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peatedly, and at each snapping the glittering body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a fly vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A second dragon-fly appeared, its body a vivid</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple, and a third. They swooped and rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the golden pool, snapping in mid air, turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">their abrupt, angular turns, creatures of incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferocity and beauty. At the moment they were noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing more or less than slaughtering-machines. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted here and there, their many-faceted eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning with blood-lust. In that mass of buzzing</seg><seg type="columnLine">flies even the most voracious appetite must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sated, but the dragon-flies kept on. Beautiful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender, graceful creatures, they dashed here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there above the pond like avenging fiends or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mythical dragons for which they had been named.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the loud, contented buzzing kept on as be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore. Their comrades were being slaughtered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds not fifty feet above their heads, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittering rows of red-eyed flies gorging themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the golden, evil-smelling liquid kept placidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on with their feasting. The dragon-flies could con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain no more, even of their chosen prey, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to swoop madly above the pool, striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the buzzing flies even though the bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">must perforce drop uneaten. One or two of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead flies--crushed to a pulp by the angry jaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a great dragon-fly--dropped among its feasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">brothers. They shook themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently one of them placed its disgusting pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boscis upon the mangled form and sipped daintily</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the juices exuding from the broken armor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another joined it, and another. In a little while a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluster of them elbowed and pushed each other for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance to join in the cannibalistic feast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl turned aside and went on, while the slim</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms of the dragon-flies still darted here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there above the pool, still striking down the dron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing flies with vengeful strokes of their great jaws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while a rain of crushed bodies was falling to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contented, glistening, horde below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only a few miles farther on Burl came upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar landmark He knew it well, but from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe distance as always. A mass of rock had heaved</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself up from the nearly level plain over which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was traveling, and formed an outjutting clilT. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">one point the rock overhung a sheer drop, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inverted ledge--a roof over nothingness--which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been preempted by a hairy creature and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a fairylike dwelling. A white hemisphere clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenaciously to the rock above, and long cables</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchored it firmly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl knew the place as one to be fearfully avoided.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Clotho spider (Qlotho Durandi), had built itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nest there, from which it emerged to hunt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unwary. Within that half-globe there was a mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster, resting upon a cushion of softest silk. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">if one went too near, one of the little inverted arches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemingly firmly closed by a wall of silk, would open</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a creature out of a dream of hell emerge, to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fiendish agility toward its prey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Surely, Burl knew the place. Hung upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer walls of the silken palace were stones and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny boulders, discarded fragments of former meals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the gutted armor from limbs of ancient prey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But what caused Burl to know the place most surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most tembly was another decoration that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dangled from the castle of this insect ogre. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the shrunken, dessicated figure of a man, all its</seg><seg type="columnLine">juices extracted and the life gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The death of that man had saved Burl's life two</seg><seg type="columnLine">years before. They had been together, seeking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new source of edible mushrooms for food. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clotho spider was a hunter, not a spinner of snares.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It sprang suddenly from behind a great puff-ball,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the two men froze in terror. Then it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly forward and deliberately chose its victim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl had escaped when the other man was seized.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now he looked meditatively at the hiding-place of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ancient enemy. Some day--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now he passed on. He went past the thicket</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which the great moths hid during the day, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the pool--a turgid thing of slime and yeast--1</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which a monster water-snake lurked. He pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated the little wood of the shining mushrooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gave out light at night, and the shadowed place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the truffle-hunting beetles went chirping</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunderously during the dark hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then he saw Saya. He caught a flash of pink</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin vanishing behind the thick stalk of a squat</seg><seg type="columnLine">toadstool, and ran forward, calling her name. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, and saw the figure with the horrible bulk</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the spider upon its back. She cried out in hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror, and Burl understood. He let his burden fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went swiftly toward her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They met. Saya waited timidly until she saw who</seg><seg type="columnLine">this man was, and then astonishment went over her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Gorgeously attired, in an iridescent cloak</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the whole wing of a great moth, with a strip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of softest fur from a night-flying creature about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his middle, with golden, feathery antennse bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his forehead, and a fierce spear in his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">:--this was not the Burl she had known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But then he moved slowly toward her, filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fierce delight at seeing her again, thrilling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy at the slender gracefulness of her form and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark richness of her tangled hair. He held out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and touched her shyly. Then, manlike, he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to babble excitedly of the things that had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to him, and dragged her toward his great</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim, the gray-bellied spider.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Saya trembled when she saw the furry bulk lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the ground, and would have fled when Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced and took it up upon his back. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of the pride that filled him came vicar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iously to her. She smiled a flashing smile, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl stopped short in his excited explanation. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was suddenly tongue-tied. His eyes became plead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and soft. He laid the huge spider at her feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spread out his hands imploringly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thirty thousand years of savagery had not les-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sened the feminity in Saya. She became aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Burl was her slave, that these wonderful things</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wore and had done were as nothing if she did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">approve.

Lastly, Charles used hydrogen, which, four-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen times lighter than air, permits you to penetrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the highest atmospheric regions, and does not ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose you to the dangers of a combustion in the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the 1st of December, 1783, three hundred thous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spectators were crowded around the Tuilleries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charles rose, and the soldiers presented arms to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Ho traveled nine leagues in the air, conduct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his balloon with an ability not surpassed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern aeronauts. The king awarded him a pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of two thousand livres; for then they encour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged new inventions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The unknown now seemed to be under tho</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence of considerable agitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See, there is Darmstadt," said he, leaning over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car. "Do you perceive the chateau? Not very</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinctly, eh? What would you have? The heat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storm makes the outline of objects waver, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you must have a skilled eye to recognize localities."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Are you certain it is Darmstadt? I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am sure of it.

I hastened to prevent him; but he over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw me with one hand, and the unballasted bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loon ascended to two thousand yards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rest easy," said he, "and do not forget that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brioschi, Biot, Gay-Lussac, Bixio, and Barral as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cended to still greater heights to make their scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific experiments."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Monsieur, we must descend," I resumed, trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to persuade him by gentleness.

Is it not an honor thus to navi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gate on aerial billows? The greatest men have</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled as we are doing. The Marchioness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Countess de Montalembert, the Countess of Podenas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mademoiselle la Garde, the Marquis de Montalem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bert, rose from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine for</seg><seg type="columnLine">these unknown regions, and the Duke de Chartres</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibited much skill and presence of mind in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascent on the 15th of July, 174.

To equal these great personages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we must penetrate still higher than they into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">celestial depths! To approach the infinite is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprehend it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rarefaction of the air was fast expending tho</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydrogen in the balloon, and I saw its lower part,</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposely left empty, swell out, so that it was abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely necessary to open the valve; but my compan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion did not seem to intend that I should manage the</seg><seg type="columnLine">balloon as I wished. I then resolved to pull the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valve-cord secretly, as he was excitedly talking; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">I feared to guess with whom I had to deal. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been too horrible! It was nearly a quarter be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore one. We had been gone forty minutes from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frankfort; heavy clouds were coming against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind from the south, and seemed about to burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you lost all hope of succeeding in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">project?"

"It was at that battle that Contello, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">order of the Government, organized a company of</seg><seg type="columnLine">balloonists. At the siege of Maubeuge General Jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dan 'derived so much service from this new method</seg><seg type="columnLine">of observation that Contello ascended twice a day</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the general himself. The communications be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the aeronaut and his agents who held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">balloon were made by means of small white, red,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yellow flags. Often the gun and cannon shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">were directed upon the balloon when he ascended,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but without result. Where General Jourdan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparing to invest Charleroi, Contello went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicinity, ascended from the plain of Jumet, and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued his observations for seven or eight hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">witih General Morlot, and this no doubt aided in</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving us the victory of Fleurus. General Jourdan</seg><seg type="columnLine">publicly acknowledged the help which the aeronau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical observations had afforded him. Well, despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">the services rendered on that occasion and during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Belgian campaign, the year which had seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning of the military career of balloons saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">also its end. The school of Meudon, founded by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government, was closed by Buonaparte on his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn from Egypt. And now, what can you expect</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the new-born infant? as Franklin said. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">infant was born alive; it should not be stifled!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The unknown bowed his head in his hands for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some moments; then rousing himself, he said, "Des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pite my prohibition, monsieur, you have opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valve."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I dropped the cord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Happily," he resumed, "we have still three hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred pounds of ballast."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is your purpose?" said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you ever crossed the seas ?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned pale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is unfortunate*" he went on, "that we are be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing driven towards the Adriatic.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was magnificent! On the 7th of January, 1785,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there being a north-west wind, their balloon was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flated with gas on the Dover coast. A mistake of</seg><seg type="columnLine">equilibrium, just as they were ascending, forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to throw out their ballast so that they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">not go down again, and they only kept thirty pounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was too little; for, as the wind did not freshen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they only advanced very slowly towards the French</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast. Besides, the permeability of the tissue</seg><seg type="columnLine">served to reduce the inflation little by little, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour and a half the aeronauts perceived that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were descending.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'What shall we do?' said Jeffries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'We are only one quarter of the way over,' re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied Blanchard, 'and very low down.

Towards the mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle of the transit the aeronauts threw over their</seg><seg type="columnLine">books and tools. A quarter of an hour after,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blanchard said to Jeffries, 'The barometer?'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'It is going up!

I tried to open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valve, but the unknown cut the cord several feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">above my head. I was lost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you see Madame Blanchard fall?" said he*</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I saw her; yes, I! I was at Tivoli on the 6th of</seg><seg type="columnLine">July, 1819. Madame Blanchard rose in a small-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sized balloon, to avoid the expense of filling, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was forced to inflate it entirely. The gas leaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out below, and left a regular train of hydrogen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its path. She carried with her a sort of pyrotechnic</seg><seg type="columnLine">aureola, suspended below her car by a wire, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was to set off in the air. This she had don©</seg><seg type="columnLine">many times before. On this day she also carried up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small parachute ballasted by a firework contri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance, that would go off in a shower of silver. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to start this contrivance after having lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with a port-fire made on purpose. She set out;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night was gloomy. At the moment of lighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">her fireworks she was so imprudent as to pass the</seg><seg type="columnLine">taper under the column of hydrogen which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaking from the balloon. My eyes were fixed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Suddenly an unexpected gleam lit up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness. I thought she was preparing a surprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The light flashed out, suddenly disappeared and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, and gave the summit of the balloon tho</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape of an immense jet of ignited gas. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinister glow shed itself over the Boulevard and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole Montmarrte quarter. Then I saw the unhappy</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman rise, try twice to close the appendage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the balloon, so as to put out the fire, then sit down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her car and try to guide her descent; for she did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not fall. The combustion of the gas lasted for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several minutes. The balloon, becoming gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, continued to descend, but it was not a fall. Tho</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind blew from the north-west and drove it towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris. There were then some large gardens just</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the house No. 16, Rue de Provence. Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blanchard essayed to fall there without danger; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the balloon and the car struck on the roof of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">764</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZTNG STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">house with a light shock. 'Save me!' cried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wretched woman. I got into the street at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. The car slid along the roof, and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countered an iron cramp. Madame Blanchard was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown out of her car and precipitated upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pavement. She was killed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These stories froze me with horror. The un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known was standing with bare head, disheveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair, haggard eyes! There was no longer any il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lusion possible. I recognized the horrible truth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was in the presence of a madman!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He threw out the rest of the ballast, and we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have now reached a height of at least nine thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand yards. Blood spurted from my nose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'Who are nobler than the martyrs of science?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried the lunatic. "They are canonized by poster-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I no longer heard him. He bent down to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear and muttered, "And have you forgotten Zam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">becarri's catastrophe? Listen. On the 7th of</seg><seg type="columnLine">October, 1804, the clouds seemed to lift a little. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the preceding days, the wind and rain had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased; but the announced ascension of Zambecarri</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be postponed. His enemies were already</seg><seg type="columnLine">bantering him. It was necessary to ascend to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">the science and himself from becoming a public</seg><seg type="columnLine">jest. It was at Boulogne. No one helped him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">inflate his balloon. He rose at midnight, accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panied by Andreoli and Grossetti. The balloon</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted slowly, for it had been perforated by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain, and the gas was leaking out. The three in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trepid aeronauts could only observe the state of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barometer by aid of a dark lantern. Zambecarri</seg><seg type="columnLine">had eaten nothing for twenty-four hours. Grossetti</seg><seg type="columnLine">was also fasting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'My friends,' said Zambecarri, 'I am overcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">by cold, and exhausted.

They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken with cold, and they were soon crusted over</seg><seg type="columnLine">with ice. The moon looked as red as blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After traversing the high regions for a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, the balloon again fell into the sea. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">four in the morning. They were half submerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the water, and the balloon dragged them along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if under sail, for several hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At daybreak they found themselves opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pesaro, four miles from the coast. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to reach it, when a gale blew them back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open sea. They were lost! The frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">boats fled at their approach. Happily, a more intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligent boatman accosted them, hoisted them on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board, and they landed at Ferrada.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A frightful journey, was it not?

It vibrated in the atmosphere. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">least noise resounded in the vaults of heaven. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe, the only object which caught my view in</seg><seg type="columnLine">immensity, seemed ready to be annihilated, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">above us the depths of the starry skies were lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">in thick darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw my companion rise up before me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The hour is come!" he said.
