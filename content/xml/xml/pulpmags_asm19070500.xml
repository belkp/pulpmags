            <seg type="columnLine">horror, the apparently lifeless body of a young girl. He succeeds, however, in resus-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">citating her, but she, upon regaining consciousness, is unable to remember even so much</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as her own identity, much less the scries of events which preceded her mysterious arrival.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The mist becomes so thick that it is impossible to leave the cottage that night, so the girl</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">retires to sleep in the loft. Dale goes out for a moment, and on returning is greeted by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the sight of a stranger loading a revolver in front of his fire. This is Sir George Belville,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">who tells Dale that he is in search of four strangers who have been seen about the moors.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Dale distrusts Belville, believing him io be involved in the packing-case mystery, and his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">suspicions become stronger when Sir George, suddenly dashing out into the night, disap-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pears in the fog and a sound of firing begins. Dale rushes out also, and when he again</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">returns finds three more strange men in the house, one of whom, dressed as a groom,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">threatens him with a revolver and admits knowing all about the box, but believer that it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">contained a lifeless body, and insists on being led to where Dale has buried it. D.ile, pre-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">suming it best to allow the groom to remain deceived, agrees to lead them to the place.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The girl, in the loft, makes a slight noise, and Dale, upon being questioned, says that it is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his wife. The groom says she must come. too. The two other men attempt to get into the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">loft, but the trap-door leading up has evidently been fastened down. While they are</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">working to force it the girl, who has escaped by a window, opens' the cottage-door from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the outside. Dale knocks down the groom, and with the girl runs out into the fog.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">There they encounter a regular running fight, in which Sir George and his servant. Mon-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that the negroes are terrified by a " ha'nt" that has appeared at Four-Pools. That night</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Radnor and Mose now have some secret. Ugly stories are circulated about Radnor</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">whose mental state is now of the worst, and who breaks out and brutally beats a negro</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">a reward for his apprehension; but the rest of the community believe Radnor guilty,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">because of the quarrels that he and his father had had, and because of the strangely</seg>
