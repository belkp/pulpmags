No man can go</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the ordeal of i*re and</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerge unscathed. And to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth there are no real exceptions. A man</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be made by war, or he may be broken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly and without redemption, but what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever happens neither he nor his point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">view will afterward be quite the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some men will always be cowards in bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle. Terror paralyzes their limbs and robs</seg><seg type="columnLine">their minds of all sense of shame. Merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to die like soldiers is beyond their strength.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is the one real argument against con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scription, which takes all who are sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, rejecting none: valuing quantity rath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er than quality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Others there are who know fear yet con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quer it. The thought of death in all its</seg><seg type="columnLine">manifold forms--by bullet, by shell or by</seg><seg type="columnLine">bayonet--is terrible, yet far more terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the thought of what men might say were</seg><seg type="columnLine">they to fail when wanted. Also, the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who turns his back on the enemy has no</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater chance of safety than he who ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vances bravely. Why not, then, die as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man should die, with honor? It is this feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that makes war possible at all. Many</seg><seg type="columnLine">things may be forgiven, but the one unfor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">givable sin is fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even in these days when science has '</seg><seg type="columnLine">forged instruments of d_^n}Ction so wicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the slaughter of bygone wars is as</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing compared with the carnage of to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, there are men who can enter a battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of heart, seeking danger as the highest</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly prize within their reach.

As they were in the past, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">are they now, prim and joyous lighters--</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatient, reckless, vengeful--in proof of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which many a hard-fought field in France</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Belgium, the gossip of trench and bil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let, and the casualty lists, bear witness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">TONY MALLAGH was a subal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tern in the South Irish. This state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment should explain a good deal;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the South Irish are particular as to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers, as many a callow youth has learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his sorrow and dismay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In looks and general appearance he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not unlike any other rather ordinary young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of six-and-twenty, who has spent most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ms life in the open, being lean and wiry</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a good-humored, sunburned face, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes in which there seemed always to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurking a glint of laughter. But Tony Mal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagh was not an ordinary young man. Far</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise. He had faults, of course, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">have all of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Tony Mallagh's faults endeared him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to people no less than his virtues. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wofully improvident and a spendthrift, hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing no sense of the value of money. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought for the mere pleasure of buying, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mainly for the'beneiit of others. An appeal</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his help, in either time or cash, met</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a ready response. He never refused a</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend any request, which it might be in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">power to grant. He was charitable to a de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gree of foolishness. He lent where there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no prospect of any return. In times</seg><seg type="columnLine">of need, taking no thought for the future</seg><seg type="columnLine">he borrowed from a Jew money-lender in'</seg><seg type="columnLine">London, and when funds were more plenti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful, paid back the debt cheerfully. And if</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his mind the rate of interest charged for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loan seemed exorbitant and out of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportion to the benefit received, he let it</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass unquestioned. An officer of the South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irish could not, in common justice to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self and his calling, stoop to argument over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of borrowed money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For his poverty, however, Tony Mallagh</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no other than himself to thank. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the age of eighteen his mother's brother, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard-headed ship broker from Glasgow, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered to take him into his business and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">safeguard his interests as if he had been his</seg><seg type="columnLine">only son. This offer rejected on the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant, lost Tony a fair chance of being a rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">man before he was forty. But there were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ued above mere wealth. As an alternative</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to amassing a fortune he joined the army,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thereby entering on a career that seemed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">particularly suited to his temperament.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His accomplishments were many and such</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as earned him the respect of his fellow sub-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">alterns. He excelled in sport of every de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scription. He had played Rugby football</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for his country, he was as good a shot with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a rifle as any man in the regiment, there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was no horse that he would not ride, or at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">least try to, and he had boxed as a light-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weight in the public-school championships</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at Aldershot. Moreover, he was absolutely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">without fear, and had never been known to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lose his temper save on one occasion, fa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mous in the annals of the regiment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This was soon after he had joined the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">First Battalion, when he had fought and de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cisively beaten a brawny greengrocer in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Commercial Road, Portsmouth, simply be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cause the said greengrocer, being somewhat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">exhilarated by strong drink, chose to assert</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his prerogative as a Briton by slugging his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weed of a horse over the head with the butt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of his whip. Tony had interfered. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fight was the natural outcome. When the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">greengrocer, a head taller and perhaps four-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">teen or so pounds heavier, had been count-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ed out by an enthusiastic crowd of blue-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">jackets, and the police had interfered, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there was every prospect of a fair-sized riot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">being brought about by the loser's friends</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and supporters, Tony had settled the mat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ter by offering to purchase the horse and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wagon on the spot. The offer was prompt-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ly accepted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">■v This was the reason why ten minutes later</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tony's commanding officer, motoring to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ward Cosham with his wife, had been struck</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">almost speechless by the spectacle of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">youngest subaltern, barehm*Ld and looking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slightly the worse for wear, seated on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">front of a dilapidated greengrocer's wagon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a policeman by his side, driving a de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">jected white horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Mr. Mallagh," said the Colonel in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mild astonishment, "Mr. Mallagh, may I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ask-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "It's all right, sir," said Tony blandly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "we're just taking this old horse to be de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> stroyed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "But, really, Mr. Mallagh, do you think</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that a greengrocer's wagon is er--quite a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suitable vehicle? Wouldn't it be as well to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">er--allow the constable to take charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Tony Mallagh</seg><seg type="columnLine">5</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horse alone, without your er--valuable</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistance?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortunately none of the spectators of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight knew that Tony was an officer in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Irish; fortunately also the Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to be possessed of feelings some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what akin to Tony's own. So the matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dropped. But, so he was told, Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">was never to do anything of the kind again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Officers of His Majesty's Army must not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight in the streets as though they were or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary mortals. It is not fitting. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story having leaked out followed Tony out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to India and home again when he was trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred to the Second Battalion, and was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated as typical of himself and his methods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony, indeed, was unpractical, a vision-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ary, rather given to acting without thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">and apt to be led away by a far-fetched</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of humor. His smile won him friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">where others found only coldness and hos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tility. He made no enemies, and his men</seg><seg type="columnLine">adored him. Also, though more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor, he was always happy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the rest, he was Irish, hailing from</seg><seg type="columnLine">County Kerry, and in love with the sweet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est and dearest girl in the world, as poor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as proud as himself, who lived with an aunt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the widow of a retired admiral, in a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">house at Farnborough, within easy reach of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the North Camp where Tony was stationed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Spring of the year, 1914.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marriage is not a risk to be entered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly. For six months Tony Mallagh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rendered strangely cautious by his good for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune, waited until such time as his finances</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed signs of improvement. But at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end c [ the six months, an interminable age,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his j atience was worn threadbare. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">novelty and charm of being engaged, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it were to the sweetest and dearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of girls, was slightly dimmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a general rule, Tony, thn--, having a</seg><seg type="columnLine">host of friends, was disinclined to consult</seg><seg type="columnLine">any regarding his own affairs. Neverthe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less he felt now that he needed advice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was only one man in the whole regi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment to whom he could go: Shannon, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">company commander, and his senior by</seg><seg type="columnLine">about ten years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony's attitude of mind toward Shannon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was peculiar. He admired him for what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was and for what he had done as a soldier.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had medals for the Tirah expedition in</seg><seg type="columnLine">'97, the Soudan in '98, the Boer War, So-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maliland, for the northwest frontier six</seg><seg type="columnLine">years before, in addition the D. S. O.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">earned in Natal on the way to Ladysmith.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a disciplinarian. B Company was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smartest in the battalion. He was sin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cere, kindly, clever. Yet from Tony Mal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagh's view-point he had his failings. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was deliberate, slow in understanding, over</seg><seg type="columnLine">methodical, particular as to detail, fussy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, as all confirmed bachelors must at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, old-maidish in his tastes. But his judg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments were to be relied on. He would say</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he thought, making no effort to hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">his opinion, favorable or not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So to Shannon, Tony went one morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">after parade and stated his case. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shannon was a man who knew nothing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, who was commonly reported to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spise the sex, was no drawback. His ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vice would be free from prejudice, one way</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the other. Also he knew Sybil's aunt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Sybil as well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon, a big man with black hair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small, close-clipped black mustache, sat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an armchair, smoking a pipe, his eyes half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed, his square-jawed face giving no clue</seg><seg type="columnLine">to what thoughts he might have. Yet Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">was strangely comforted even by the knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge that he listened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you see how things are, sir! What</seg><seg type="columnLine">oughc I to do? It's rotten luck on the girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know, to be engaged to a fat-headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">chump like I am. Lord! We may drift on</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this kind of way for about fifteen years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or more, till I'm a Major, if I ever get that</seg><seg type="columnLine">far. I'll never have any more money than</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have now, apart from my pay, I'm cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain. And what's that to a girl as ripping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as good as Sybil? Nothing--nothing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. I know, from--well, just from know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her, that she'd marry me on what I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. But would it be fair? Would it be</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing the game?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon frowned and looked if anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather bored.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's promised to marry you, has she--</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time or other, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rather!" said Tony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Said anything to any one?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir. You see--well, we've kept it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret for many reasons."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! And no one knows?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a blessed soul!" Tony waited, won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering at the drift of the questions that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. "Of course, sir, I might try and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">change into something that's better paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the line: the A. S. C., or the Army</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ordnance, for instance. Or I could get out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Egypt, perhaps, or West Africa, or-"</seg><seg type="columnLine">6</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon leaned forward suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that? What's that you say?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leave the South Irish! Tony, you're a fool!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You can do one thing, so far as I can see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and only one. I know your fiancee--er--</seg><seg type="columnLine">well enough to er--realize that if she loves--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the word seemed to worry him--"if she er--</seg><seg type="columnLine">cares for you, Tony, and you say she does,</seg><seg type="columnLine">money will play only a small part in the er--</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair. Poor! Of course you are, and al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways will be. Even if you had a million,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd be hard up." He grunted. "Huh!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leave the battalion, indeed! Not if I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you think I ought to marry soon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At once, if you can." He hoisted him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self out of his chair and stretched out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and yawned. "And now, get out! I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick and tired of hearing you talk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony grinned and stood up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's jolly good of you, sir, to have both-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered. It is, really."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get out!" repeated Shannon gruffly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't worry me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By his manner he seemed to regard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interview as of no importance, or as merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">a waste of time that might be otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">more usefully employed. But when Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">had closed the door after him, he dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his chair once more and stared blindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the little room, a dull pain in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart and his teeth pressing deeply into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower lip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed impossible. Had his pride been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so great that he had been unable to see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was passing before his very eyes? Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">others seen and he been ignorant of open</seg><seg type="columnLine">warnings? The girl he had thought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry, the one girl in the whole world a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man might worship unashamed, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken from him by Tony Mallagh. Tony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the irresponsible, extravagant, happy-go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky, reckless, hard-up Tony, had beaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Sybil! In the depths of his despair</seg><seg type="columnLine">there yet remained a feeling of thankful-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness that he had been spared the shame of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing from her own lips what he now</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rose from his chair and stood gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the window on to the barrack square.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A sense of his own worthlessness gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. What right had he to hope that a girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Sybil would have chosen a man like</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself: a man with no knowledge beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Army; a man who could sit tongue-tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">and half-frightened in her presence? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of his own conceit--which he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have hated in another--sickened him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was all over now and done with.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sybil would marry Tony Mallagh, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">woi Id be very happy together and very</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor, and he himself, Captain R. B. Shan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">non, D. S. O., Second Battalion, Royal</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Irish Fusiliers, would work hard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope for war and try and put out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind the picture of the girl whom he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought his for the mere asking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg><seg type="columnLine">LOVE, AND A RUMOR OF WAR</seg><seg type="columnLine">NOT even Tony Mallagh, reckless and</seg><seg type="columnLine">improvident as he was, would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">risked marriage, had not matters taken an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpected turn. It was while lie was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ireland, on leave, that he read of the death</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sybil's aunt. He left for Aldershot the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same evening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl, dressed in deep black, was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the garden at the back of the house when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he arrived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sybil," he said presently, after the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">greetings were over, "what do you intend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She gave a little shrug.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know, Tony. I've got to earn a</seg><seg type="columnLine">living somehow, of course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!" said Tony sagely. "Indeed. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. Earn a living." He looked at her with</seg><seg type="columnLine">loving admiration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You sec, dear," said the girl, "Aunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tane's income was for life only. And--well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">t lat's all gone. So I must do something,</seg><seg type="columnLine">n.ustn't I?" He said nothing and she con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued, "I'm fairly clever at housekeeping, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can look after servants, keep accounts, gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den, and so on, so I thought T might be use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful as a companion to some oiitrr-x^r a govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ess, or-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony interrupted with a grunt signifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">extreme disapproval and disgust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quite so. A governess, eh! Ye-es. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can just see you governessing, sweetheart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quite so. You've no people at all, dear</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only a sister in Dublin. Her husband's</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the engineers. I could go to her for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while, but--well, she's not very well off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it's better for me to do something for</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, isn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Tony decidedly. "It isn't--</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of the kind. Ridiculous! Wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Tony Mallagh</seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hear of it. Sybil, my love, let us consider</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the facts. Why put off any longer what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> might be done now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   She watched him in silence, the sunshine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> makirg her hair like spun gold, her blue</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> eyes, blue as the sky above, very grave and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tender and loving, her cheeks flushed, a lit-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tle nervous smile on her lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Sweetheart," said Tony, "we've nothing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to lose by marriage. Nothing. All to gain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I'm sick of this everlasting waiting. At</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> this rate we won't be married for fifty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> years, not if we're supposed to be waiting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> till I can give you what you deserve. Con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sider the facts, old girl, and decide. What's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> more, if the money I have now can keep me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">*	throwing it about like I do and not trying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to save, it'll keep the pair of us. That's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> logic. We'd be poor, of course, but--will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> you risk it? Could you marry a poor man,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sybil dear, and be happy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "It's not myself I'm worried about," she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> said slowly, "it's you. I've always been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> poor, but it will be hard on you, Tony, to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> have to give up-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Rubbish and fiddlesticks!" said Tony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took her into his arms and kissed her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If that's all, sweetheart, we'll be married</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> just as soon as we jolly well can. I'll tackle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the Colonel first thing in the morning. You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> leave it to me. He won't mind when I tell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> him everything, I know. He's eating out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of my hand these days. Tame as a white</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> rabbit with some green-stuff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   And, allowing for exaggeration, Tony was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> quite correct. Married subalterns were not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> approved of in the South Irish for many</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> reasc is, but for once the Colonel raised no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> obje&lt; tions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "In your case," he said, "I think it's al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> most the best thing that could have hap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> pened. You've made a most excellent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> choice--most excellent. And, s~^ny, if I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> were you I'd leave all my financial affairs to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> my wife. From what I know there's more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sense in that young lady's little finger than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> there is in your whole body. Now run</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> along and get married as soon as you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> please."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   And married they were within the month.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quite the most valuable of their many</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> presents came from Shannon, who, much to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> his regret, was called up to London on busi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ness on the very morning of the wedding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was in the middle of June.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   For a little over five weeks Tony lived in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a kind of dream in which fact and fancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed strangely mingled. Never before</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he known such happiness. Never in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed had he thought such happiness possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble. Sybil was wonderful. Each day that</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed revealed in her unexpected charms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deep down in his heart Tony pitied those</seg><seg type="columnLine">less fortunate than himself: not only bache-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lors, but men with wives less lovely, or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect than his wife. For, after all, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">well knew, there was only one Sybil. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had existed without her puzzled him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But if marriage brought to him happi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, so also it brought fear. Supposing he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to die, what would become of Sybil?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thought of the future, with all its possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bilities of disaster, daunted him. He must</seg><seg type="columnLine">make provision, certainly. But how? This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the problem that, try as he might, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not solve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon met him one day walking slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly across the parade-ground toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tony," he said, "wliat's wrong?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony came to himself with a start.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's that? Hullo, sir, never saw you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wrong! Nothing." And as if to prove his</seg><seg type="columnLine">words he smiled with the utmost good na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Known you too long, now, old son, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know when you're worrying. How's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife? Quite fit, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rather!" said Tony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, something's troubling you, I know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tell it a mile off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thinking," Tony laughed. "That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shouldn't do it too often, then. Bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you." He hesitated. "Finances all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes--so far as it goes. Sometimes one</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't see clearly. You know, the future</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all that kind of tiling. But I'm not</seg><seg type="columnLine">worrying." A sudden thought flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Tony's mind. "You don't notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I've changed at all, do you, since I</seg><seg type="columnLine">married. Because I haven't. Not in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very least." He wanted that much to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood plainly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Changed!" said Shannon. "No. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dickens should you be changed?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm glad of that," said Tony. Then for</seg><seg type="columnLine">no particular reason he added: "I think if</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything happened to Sybil. I should--</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, I don't know what I should do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon stared at him without comment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and passed on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE came an evening soon after</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a certain rumor, that owed its</seg><seg type="columnLine">origin to a shot fired in the streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a town in far-off Bosnia, reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mess of the Royal South Irish Fusiliers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All through dinner the tide of talk had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ebbed and flowed in well-worn channels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No trace of care or worry for the future</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed on the faces of those gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the long table under the shaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights. Life offered to man nothing of more</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance than sport in all its branches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting, fishing, racing, shooting, golf, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the theater, perhaps, or London, or leave in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Autumn when the year's training should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be finished. As if by instinct, all mention</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any topic dealing with the army was</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when the last of the mess waiters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolid privates of the regiment, had left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, there was a sudden silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Colonel, broad and thick^set and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray as a badger, a string of medals adorn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his scarlet mess-jacket, a bone-white</seg><seg type="columnLine">scar on his forehead, bearing witness to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skill of a Boer marksman at Inniskilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hill, leaned back in his chair and glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">from side to side through half closed eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lids.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he said after a while, "it looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the real thing at last. Or doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Came, the senior Major, nodded. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see how they can keep out. Not Germany;</seg><seg type="columnLine">not Russia. And where's it to end, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're not ready for war, of e^rse," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the other majors. "We never are.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet, maybe, the first thing we know, we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be fighting!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony Mallagh, who was dining in mess,</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And just because a maniac at the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of Europe puts a bullet into some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">we've never heard of! All the same, it'ull</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a good job for Ireland if it does come.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Any war's better than civil war." Shannon</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at him curiously. "But," and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on with a little laugh, "we won't fight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course. This Government of ours isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to let itself be dragged into a war just</seg><seg type="columnLine">on account of a little nation like Serbia be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wiped out, is it? We'll stay out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sell goods, ammunition and guns and under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vests and boot-laces and tracts and whisky</seg><seg type="columnLine">to both sides." 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you, Shannon," said O* Colonel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"what do you say, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think, sir, I know. It's a war,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's certain. The biggest thing that ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In [the anteroom afterward the Mess re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved itself into a committee of public</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety for the defense of the realm, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought knowledge from books of reference,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the army list and many maps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To Tony Mallagh, seated as far as possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble from the chattering groups, a volume of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Encyclopedia Britannica in his lap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came Shannon, hands in pockets, a grim</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile on his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dropped into a chair beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm looking up the habits and customs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Serbs," said Tony. "Curiosity, that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shouldn't worry about Serbia," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shannon. "Try under B."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why B?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Belgium."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!" said Tony. "Do you mean--you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't think, sir, that--" He closed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">book. "You don't mean to tell me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germans will invade Belgium to get at</seg><seg type="columnLine">France?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not?" said Shannon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then," said Tony miserably, "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see how even this fool of a Government can</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep from fighting. Good Lord!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon was troubled in his mind. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">would he himself, supposing he were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony's shoes--a married man, married less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than two months--bear the news that miglit</seg><seg type="columnLine">send him across the Channel to the biggest</seg><seg type="columnLine">war the world had ever seen?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's war, at last, then," said Tony in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">low voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Afraid so," said Shannon. "It's hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">011 you, though--awful hard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony straightened lw;self with a jerk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thrust two fingers between his collar</seg><seg type="columnLine">and neck as if choking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, it's hard," he said. "As a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fact, sir, I'd been thinking a good deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">lately of the things that might happen:</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickness, illness, accidents, and so on. Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage makes a man think, somehow. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the only thing I didn't think of was</seg><seg type="columnLine">war. I want to see some fighting some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">or other, of course. Who doesn't? But--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he uttered a hard laugh--"rather rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck, isn't it, coming at this particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">time ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A voice hailed them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, Shannon, you're an expert. See if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can figure tins out. And what's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Tony Mallagh</seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter with Tony Mallagh? He looks as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd committed a particularly beastly mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, or lozl his platoon, like he did last</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thursday. Tony, dearest, what is it? Ickle</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain in 'oo tummy? Tell nursey!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony laughed, and with that the worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed off, not'to return until he was back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his own home with Sybil, descending the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sybil," he said, "I've something to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Something rather important."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing wrong, is there?" she asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony nodded, and she led the way into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drawing-room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, dear, what is it? Don't be afraid!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stood by the table, very slim and</seg><seg type="columnLine">erect, and looking lovelier than ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sybil, I've bad news for you, dear, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the regiment. Dearest, there's going to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a war in Europe, and they think we'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The South Irish!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes." The thought of what she must</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffer rose up to stifle him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If they send you, dear, you must go,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustn't you? It's duty, isn't it? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're worried, you poor boy, because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me!" She kissed him lightly, "Poor old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony! You mustn't. Why, Tony, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't mean to say you think me a coward!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her laugh sounded almost happy. "Tony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're forgetting I'm the daughter of a sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dier, as well as being the wife of one. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">not frightened, love--not in the least."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You darling!" said Tony. "I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're the bravest girl alive--and the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful. I was almost afraid of telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!" said the girl. "As far as that goes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were talking it over tonight at dinner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Carne and I. Besides jl . been think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for the last day or so we might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">war. If we fight, well and good. It can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be helped, can it? And I wouldn't have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold back, Tony, or feel that marriage made</seg><seg type="columnLine">you any less of a soldier, for all the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And after that Tony Mallagh put from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him all thoughts of worry or gloom. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">future could take care of itself. If the</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Irish Fusiliers were sent to the war,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if there were a war at all, he could go, light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartedly, free from anxiety, knowing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sybil wished him to fight and to fight his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardest, and what could a man want more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that?</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg><seg type="columnLine">GOOD-BY</seg><seg type="columnLine">ITHIN the wTeek war was declared and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there followed days of wony and end-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less labor for those in authority: suppressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement, feverish activity, much drilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reservists, musketry, field days, inocula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, inspections, with a vague undercur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent of emotion apparent throughout the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole regiment. Rumors abounded, both</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the officers' mess and the men's canteen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Imperceptibly but surely the bonds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">discipline tightened. The Colonel, so it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, was feeling the reins, and the regiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">responded. The number of defaulters grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of a sudden beautifully less, even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most confirmed of offenders became cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tious, drunkenness decreased as by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle, nor was it that the non-commis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sioned officers turned blind eyes on those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who fell from the path of virtue. If this</seg><seg type="columnLine">were war, war that would bring to the South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irish much honor and glory and more fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing than even an Irish regiment had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed of, then was it necessary that each</seg><seg type="columnLine">man should take the field ready and fit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do credit to himself and his battalion. Also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the point of view of the rank and file,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it behooved the mere private to walk warily</seg><seg type="columnLine">lest when the order came, he should be left</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, at home, confined to cells, doomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">inaction and misery, while others more vir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuous, fought and perchance died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The time for good-bys drew near. Shan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">non, busy with the affairs of his company,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen little of Tony Mallagh for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, save in the presence of others, or on</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, one afternoon, Tony overtook him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said that Sybil was leaving for London</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next morning and would he come up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house, if he could spare half-an-hour or</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, to say good-by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Shannon. "Yes, certainly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Very glad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She said she'd like to see you," con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued Tony, "and I've been so rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">lately I never thought anything more about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it until today. You see, we decided it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be better for her not to be here when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">regiment leaves. She didn't want it. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">more did I. Too depressing. And she's</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to stay with Mrs. Carne in London."</seg><seg type="columnLine">So that evening Shannon sat in the small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare drawing-room, by the tall window that</seg><seg type="columnLine">10</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened on to the lawn, while the girl, wrap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped in a big white cloak--for the night air</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cool--talked lightly as one without</seg><seg type="columnLine">care.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not until Tony, whistling cheerful-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, growling about his kit, went off and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">them together, that she told why it was she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sent for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's very good of you to come, Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shannon," she said quietly. "I wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask you a favor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anything I can do, Mrs. Mallagh, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm leaving tomorrow," she said, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this is the last time I'll see you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Till er--we come back," put in Shannon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Till we er--come back, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When will that be? There's always the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'when/ Captain Shannon, isn't there?" For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a while she was silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the road there came the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some one whistling. In the distance a train</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumbled through the night, bound perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tide-water with troops. The breeze whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered in the leaves of the trees, bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it the scent of roses. The clear notes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a bugle sounded faintly from the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the North Camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Captain Shannon," said the girl sudden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, "the regiment, you and the rest, are go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to fight. That's as it should be. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman worth her salt would wish for any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's hard on the married men," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shannon gruffly. - hard! I beg your</seg><seg type="columnLine">pardon, Airs. Mallagh--inexcusable."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's not easy for us women," she con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued in a low voice. "But that doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">alter facts, does it? And if we are to fight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why--we must fight our best. It's the wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that tries one, I know, wailing until</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's a telegram, or a letter, or even a line</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the paper and we learn that what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared has happened, and--and life isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth living any more.'- For an instant a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade of worry showed in the blue eyes. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember when 1 was only a small girl, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eldest brother, twenty-one he was, was kill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed at Spion Kop--you were there with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">regiment,, weren't you? And we saw his</seg><seg type="columnLine">name in the paper before the wire arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the War Office. Breakfast-time it was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mother-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stopped and her fingers plucked idly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the white fur on her cloak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it doesn't do any good to think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'hat might happen. That's why 1 in al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways so cheerful; Tony, too. Thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes you imagine things, and then they</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mustn't talk like that, Mrs. Mal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagh," said Shannon, "it's not right. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">--good Lord! Don't you understand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He, in his turn, broke off, helpless to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">what should be said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shook her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't think, for one moment, that I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep him at home, even if I had the power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or that--that I think he's going to die. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't. But, Captain Shannon--" she lean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed forward in her chair, and her eyes sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">his as if seeking some ray of hope or com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort--"listen! I know he'll come back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, I feel it, but I can't help being a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious. I can't really, though I try not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well!" said Shannon doubtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What I wanted to ask you was: Would</seg><seg type="columnLine">you just keep an eye on Tony when he gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to the front, and pull him up if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think he's deliberately trying to get him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self killed!" She gave a little laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon stared at her in dumb ix-wilder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Did she think he could help? Did</seg><seg type="columnLine">she think that it was within his power or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power of any mortal to save her husband</seg><seg type="columnLine">from harm? Had she no idea what war was</seg><seg type="columnLine">or meant? The very calmness of her words</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her steady smile was an added mystery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course I know that he's got to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">into danger. I want him to. He's got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove himself as good as the best. I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be proud of him. But you know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony is. He's foolish in some ways. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">never seen any fighting yet, and he's bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be reckless over it, just to show that he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">brave, so I thought that if you could give</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a word of advice it might help him."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She raised her eyebrows. "You don't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm panicky, do you. Captain Shannon?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm not. I'm not even worrying. But--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's all I've got in the world, and--well, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went, life wouldn't be worth the trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">of living."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A deep pity swept over Shannon, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're not angry with me, Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shannon?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Angry! Of course not.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I asked you because you've been a friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, and--'' she hesitated, her cheeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming--"and a friend to me, also.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A friend! The word seemed to mock him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                        .</seg><seg type="columnLine">&lt;A friend! And somehow the old heartache</seg><seg type="columnLine">|and longing that he had imagined put aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever, came back. He himself had suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered, far more than he had thought possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble. So, now, he could feel the agony that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped the girl seated by the open window</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the girl he had once hoped to make his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife. If Tony died, she would lose every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing life had to offer. She said as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'll do my best," he said quietly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thank you," she said. "I knew you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were footsteps in the hall, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Hope you didn't think I was neglecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, sir. I've been working over the ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lasting problem of packing my kit. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth do they expect us to manage with</seg><seg type="columnLine">only thirty-seven pounds of baggage, eh?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shannon dragged his wandering thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the future to the present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You either leave half what you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, or else you start off to the war with</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a hundredweight of stuff strapped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you beside what you've got to carry al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord! I'm no blighted dromedary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And think of the looks of the thing. I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look like a soldier, not like a traveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinker. Bad for the illustrated papers, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Special attraction: double-page photograph</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the front, 'Charge of the South Irish'</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoiled by honorable self in foreground, car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rying a portable bath-tub, and a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">waders, and a gramaphone, on my back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and encouraging my brave lads to go on</seg><seg type="columnLine">without me, waving a fishing-rod in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and the parrot's cage in the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not a nice thought, is it? And I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">really charge, carrying everything I ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take with me, could I?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll excuse him, Captain Shannon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm sure. He's not often taken like that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We try and keep it quiet. Sad, isn't it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shannon laughed and stood up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ''1 must go now, I'm afraid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sybil was also standing, smiling as if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been discussing the most unimportant</seg><seg type="columnLine">topics imaginable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-by, then, and thank you very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much, indeed. You'll write sometimes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't you? You won't forget, will you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Rather not. Only too delighted."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She held out a small hand. "Good-by,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then. And we'll meet after the war is over!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tell you what," said Tony with sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiasm, "we'll all have dinner to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether in London as soon as we get back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the Savoy or the Carlton. Sybil, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't forget, will you? Or--or if we're all</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke by that time, the cabman's shelter at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hyde Park Comer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right," said Shannon gravely. "Mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's settled. And we'll go to the theater</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he closed the gate of the front garden</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned away he saw Tony and the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing in the doorway side by side, sil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">houetted against the light. He wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he waved his hand what bitterness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorrow good-by might mean for them. Less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than two months of marriage and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And for once Shannon could feel glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he at least left no one to mourn his</seg><seg type="columnLine">going.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      TWO days later, very early in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, the Second Battalion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Royal South Irish Fusiliers</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung out of barracks and down the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">road that led to the station and the battle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields of Belgium. And the tune to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they marched, played by the drums and fifes</seg><seg type="columnLine">wras "Garry OwTen," a tune to which their</seg><seg type="columnLine">forbears had set out nearly a hundred years</seg><seg type="columnLine">before on a like errand of mercy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they passed through the village, men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women came to the door of the houses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">window's were thrown open and heads thm*t</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth, and, as if sprung into existence from</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowhere, a swarm of small boys kept pace</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the band. The men, marching at ease,</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed and joked their good-bys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon, picking up the old familiar land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks with his eyes, listening to the shrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">whimper of the fifes, saw standing by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of a small shop, apart from the people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a girl wrapped in a long coat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something about her seemed vaguely fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliar. Tony Mallagh marching with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platoon immediately ahead had halted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was waiting for him to come abreast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He quickened his pace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tony," he said, "there's Sybil!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What!" Tony uttered a little exclama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of despair, then making his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the crowd reached the girl in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long coat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sybil," he whispered. "You shouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have. Why did you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She held out her hands and smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had to."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Tony Mallagh</seg><seg type="columnLine">w</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whether people were watching or not</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no difference now. He drew her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and kissed her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I just had to," she said. "But I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended that you should see me, Tony.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Never."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ' My dear, my dear!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her lips quivered, and it seemed as if her</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength were failing, yet she still smiled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'd better go, Tony. I mustn't keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's hard, love--I never knew how hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">till now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hush! Don't make it worse, dear. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be all right while you're away.

It can't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And why should it? They were only go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to fight Germany. And what was Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">many? The greatest military power on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth--nothing more. And were they to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be frightened because of that? WTiat were</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere numbers? Did he not belong to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Royal South Irish Fusiliers, the finest regi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment in the whole world, bar none? W7as</seg><seg type="columnLine">not that sufficient in itself? So:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will be all over by the new year," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony. "You see if it isn't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She flashed a little smile at him through</seg><seg type="columnLine">her tears, for she was crying now, and tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course. Sooner, I hope."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-by, sweetheart. Good-by."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She kissed him on the lips, twice, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him a litde shove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go, dear. Please."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned and hurried after the regiment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tightness in his throat and a mist beforc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE OPDEAL OF FIFE</seg><seg type="columnLine">9	rO THOSE ignorant of war, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">A be many, a regiment's history and</seg><seg type="columnLine">traditions may seem of small importance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But a regiment that bears on its colors the</seg><seg type="columnLine">names of famous victories, and can trace</seg><seg type="columnLine">its ancestry back tp the days of Wellington</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Marlborough or Clive or Wolfe, has a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faith in its own prowess that counts for</seg><seg type="columnLine">much when there is an enemy to be faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">ami beaten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The very thought of failure was to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of the South Irish, nut merely remote,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but impossible. Would they, men who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined the army of their own free will, men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had served in the four quarters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe, go down before those who were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scripts, forced to serve? Not though they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were outnumbered, ten to one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What German regiment was tit to breathe</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same air as the South Irish? The rank</seg><seg type="columnLine">and file had faith not only in themselves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in their officers. If there were fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be done, the Royal South Irish Fusiliers</seg><seg type="columnLine">would show the way to any battalion of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">regiment, Scots, Irish, Welch or English, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the army. The Guards themselves could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more. Even the recruits, fresh from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their training at the depot in the South of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ireland, non-commissioned officers, or newly</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined reservists, not yet free of the taint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of civil life, who talked of war as men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew its meaning, could feel that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighters no less than those others, old soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of twenty years of service.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Tony Mallagh watching his men. "hear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their talk and laughter and songs, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">rejoice and feel certain in his heart that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheresoever it might be his duty to lead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there they would follow. For were they not</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the same blood as the men of Inkerman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Delhi, and Barossa and Waterloo? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">campaign might go against them--generals</seg><seg type="columnLine">and staff officers might blunder, plans might</seg><seg type="columnLine">miscarry, the artillery be outranged--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever happened, though the machine it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self might break down through overwork,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blame could never rest with the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">--or not with the men of the South Irish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not even the thought of Sybil waiting at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home for news, entirely took from him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride he had in his regiment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whatever the future might have in store,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the present with its steady tramping of</seg><seg type="columnLine">many feet, the passing of horse and guns in</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds of thick dust, the little towns in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot sunlight, the bivouac under the stars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meeting at cross-roads of other regi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, the bustle and movement and change</seg><seg type="columnLine">of scene, was all that mattered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then one afternoon there was borne</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the breeze a faint far-off rumbling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that?" said a voung private.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thundher?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ihundher?"

An'</seg><seg type="columnLine">what happened afther!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">NEXT morning the South Irish Fu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">silicrs were under lire. By noon</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were blooded, two men being</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed by shrapnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The success or failure of a regiment in</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle depends on its officers no less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the rank and file. This is beyond argu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. And although skill in the art of war</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a knowledge of tactics, strategy, topogra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phy', military history and higher mathemat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ics--are no doubt highly useful, the private</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldier, and more especially the Irish pri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vate, demands in his officer not only skill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but also courage--the courage that stops</seg><seg type="columnLine">short of nothing, not even death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In Shannon, the men of the South Irish</seg><seg type="columnLine">found one after their own hearts--their ideal</seg><seg type="columnLine">tighter. In the agony and despair of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long retreat from Mons to the Marne, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">day after day they were driven along with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out mercy, footsore and sleepy and famish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, turning at times and fighting fierce rear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard actions to save both themselves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. Shannon never for a moment lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">their confidence. Even when things were at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their worst--when the German guns raked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trenches, when men were dying like flies</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Autumn, when the mere horror and help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessness of modern war sapped the courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">and weakened the resolution of the strong-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est--Shannon was at his best.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And when the limit had been reached be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond which human endurance can not go--</seg><seg type="columnLine">when even the finest soldiers on earth, out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbered, must break--his voice and pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence, scornfully tolerant of their weakness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought back to the men around him their</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-respect. He asked no man to go where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he himself would not venture. His life he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to regard as of no importance. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was without fear. Even casualties that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced the regiment to less than two-thirds</seg><seg type="columnLine">its strength left him unmoved. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attitude he purposely adopted. Noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing could be gained, so he argued rightly, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">letting his men see that he too felt the shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">and horror of death in its most awful form.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony Mallagh watched him with despair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For in spite of the tales that he had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of past campaigns, Tony had never in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart believed it possible that any man</seg><seg type="columnLine">could bear himself in action as did Shannon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet what Shannon could do, he, Tony Mal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagh, must do also. No matter how fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire, an officer of the Royal South Irish</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fusiliers, the finest regiment in the army,</seg><seg type="columnLine">must show himself proof against the slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est sign of fear. He must remember always</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his men trusted in him to lead them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that whatever happened, no matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">what others in other regiments might say</seg><seg type="columnLine">or do, no sign of panic or hesitation in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of danger should escape him. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the law of the regiment that must not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There are some secrets a man will try and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide even from himself. When first he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the distant thudding of the field-guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony had felt a thrill of fierce excitement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet as the time drew near when he should</seg><seg type="columnLine">find himself in action a dull lassitude crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him. His limbs seemed to lose their</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. His throat was dry and parched.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This, he knew, was Nothing. Merely over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement. Nervousness. He had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feeling before, often, before entering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring to box. It was nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet when the regiment came at</seg><seg type="columnLine">length into the zone of fire, when the shells</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to burst on every side, and the bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets whispered overhead, and men dropped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then did Tony Mallagh, Lieutenant in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Royal South Irish Fusiliers, find himself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grip of a fear more terrible than any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he could have dreamed. Nor did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear pass, as he had fondly hoped. Rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">did it grow and grow, fed on the sights and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds of battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But though his whole being craved for</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety, though had he obeyed his instincts</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have turned and fled, he forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to a semblance of indifference to</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger. He laughed and jested with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, he talked easily, he steadied his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">and controlled his movements through sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of will. He was afraid of being killed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of being wounded, and yet still more</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of being called a coward. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greater fear. Had he been less a cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard, so he reasoned bitterly, he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">shamed himself forever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> War was terrible. War was the waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour upon hour while the enemy's guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched for the hidden trench. War was</seg><seg type="columnLine">M</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">the listening to the sobs of the dying and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wounded who couJd no I die. War</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the witnessing of sights more terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">than hell itsell could offer. War was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembering in dead of night those left at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home to wait and mourn. Vet, only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">short weeks before--and this was to Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most bitter thought of all--war had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed no more than the long awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to prove his manhood. The first</seg><seg type="columnLine">day's fighting in the trendies had told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything he wished to know. He, Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mallagh, who had looked on courage as</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's highest virtue, was a coward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">EARLY one morning, before it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">light,ra large force of the enemy at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked a post held by B Company</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the South Irish, a shallow trench thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the night before on the edge of a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the sky was no more than a pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray in the east, scattered shots were heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">from in front. Soon after, the men of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlying picket arrived at a double, drag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging with them one who was wounded. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germans were close at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony, who had been talking with Shan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">non, caught his breath. So the Germans</seg><seg type="columnLine">were coming, were they? How many? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">corporal in charge of the picket did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. "Swarrms of thim!" he said. Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself shaking as if cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But cold or not--and he had not felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was cold--he must stand his ground or</seg><seg type="columnLine">else people might say he was frightened 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that would never do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon was speaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They'll be coming along in a minute or</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, now, and we've got to give 'em a bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dusting.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon's voice was filled with a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">exultation. Tony turned to him, heavy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">listless. He was going to fight. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to be shot at. And perhaps he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to die.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless, true to his training, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced a laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rather!" he said. "We're in for a jolly</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrip, I hope. Like their infernal impu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence trying to rush us, isn't it?''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved off to that portion of the trench</seg><seg type="columnLine">held by his platoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His platoon sergeant stretched out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm and pointed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Luk, sott! Do ye sec thim?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in the dimness Tony made out ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vancing toward the trench a gray mass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge and indistinct and vague.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gulped unsteadily. Were the Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mans so near as that then? Ought he not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be doing something? Did Shannon</seg><seg type="columnLine">know?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, as in a dream, he heard in suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cession his own voice giving the word of</seg><seg type="columnLine">command, "Number five platoon--at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy in front--rapid fire!" the answering</seg><seg type="columnLine">volleys from the rifles of his men, and a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheering, unlike the deep cheers of British</seg><seg type="columnLine">troops, from the foe. Like the oncoming of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wall, the Germans advanced. Tony, fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing back the fears that had gripped him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let them have it, South Irish!" he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let them have it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His men were strangely restive. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing was ragged. Three or four were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even firing at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter, there?" said Tony.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You, Reilly, you're not wounded, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At another time these same men would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have resisted to the death. But now, either</seg><seg type="columnLine">one night's waiting, or the mystery and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chill of the dawn, or the suddenness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack, had sapped their resolution, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">without waiting, without warning, as if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement were prearranged or ordered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they clambered out of their trench and ran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony, knowing that if they left him his</seg><seg type="columnLine">only hope of hiding his fears was gone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a half-hearted, despairing effort to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop their flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "-you!" he cried, and his voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost in the crash of musketry from the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in front. "-you, you fools! Get</seg><seg type="columnLine">back! What the blazes do vou think you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Go on, bhoys!" shouted a man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They're on top of us, the divils!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony staggered against a tree, overborne</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the rush. The bullets from the Germans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who advanced firing from the hip, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">swishing through the branches. A man</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled and dropped his ritle, then went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on slowly, limping. Another shrieked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mortal agony and fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that settled it, so far as Tony Mal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagh was concerned. He turned and ran,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a thought save for his own safety.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was he to be left to face the Germans sin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gle-handed? Was he to be killed, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake ol a mere, outworn tradition? Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not his life as valuable to himself as the life</seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Tony Mallagh</seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any private, and was it not much more</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable to the regiment?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had made his way at a quick, shuf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fling run, almost to the other side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small wood when his foot caught in a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jecting root. He tripped and fell. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">head crashed against a tree-trunk and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew no more until faintly, as if at a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance, he seemed to hear a voice calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">his name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tony, old chap, come on, what is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon's voice, surely!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony opened his eyes, to find himself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wood, huddled against a tree, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun just risen, showing like a red orb</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the mist, and Shannon on his knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him. His head throbbed. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazed and stupid. He put his hand to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead and brought it away, covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood. Two or three privates stood looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him. One was wounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hullo! Why--why-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Feeling better?" said Shannon. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't much time to spare, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He noticed then that Shannon was star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at him in a curious way, almost as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were angry or disappointed or puzzled. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to think. Shannon helped him to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've got to be moving, and pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick," he said. "They'll be coming on</seg><seg type="columnLine">again in a minute or two."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taking him by the arm, he hurried him</seg><seg type="columnLine">off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who'll be coming on?" asked Tony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then a dull feeling of horror crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him. He had turned his back on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy. The others had beaten them off;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had run. Did Shannon know? Had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen him make off? Surely not. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been too dark. And then ....</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not going too fast, am I?" said Shan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">non suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Tony. "My head aches, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm better. Much better. And, what--</seg><seg type="columnLine">what happened?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You ought to know, Tony. What were</seg><seg type="columnLine">you doing, eh?" There was a note of doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Shannon's voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My fellows bolted. God only knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">why!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some of them did. Not all. But what</seg><seg type="columnLine">about you, man? What were you doing?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where were you going?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me! I went after them--to rally them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lo	try and get them back. And as I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing my best to turn them, I caught ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot and fell. That's all I remember." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!" said Shannon. "I understand. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looked queer, perhaps," said Tony with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nervous laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, nonsense! Might have happened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Tony felt that a burden had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted from off his mind. Shannon under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood. Shannon knew now that he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">rallying his men. His secret was safe. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there remained in his consciousness the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread that when next the hour of trial came,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he should be tested once more, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should fail again. For whatever might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed of him, the truth remained. He,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an officer in the Royal South Irish Fusiliers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had run in action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They joined the rest of the battalion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hullo, Tony, what's wTong? Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded, are you?" One of the other sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alterns spoke to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not exactly," said Tony. "Fell and cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head open."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hard luck! Some of your people ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived back here some time ago- looking like</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost sheep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know. I tried to stop them."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Shouldn't worn.', old thing. They'll not</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hope not, anyway," said Tony.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shannon was troubled. Even in the fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that followed, for the Germans attacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more, and in the retirement early in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the afternoon, at the back of his mind, ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truding itself when least expected, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange wonderment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony had run, of course. That was ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vious. But why? And to hide the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">be had lied. Had he tried to rally his men</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would not have followed them so far.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What fear was it that had driven him to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">what no man should do and call himself a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man? Had he been seized with sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic? Or could it be that Tony Mallagh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as good a man as ever walked--Tony, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxer, the best rider in Uie battalion, Tonv.</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who had fought the greengrocer at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portsmouth, was a coward! To Shannon it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed impossible. And yet it was true</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ton)' had turned his back on the enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and run. Why?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then there was Sybil. Sybil waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">at home for newrs! And Shannon, remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bering that last evening in the little draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-room and how proudly she had talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">16</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Tonv, felt a sudden wild anger. Tony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her husband, had proved himself unworthy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After this Shannon noticed many things</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Tony Mallagh that were puzzliug.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He studied him tinder lire, on the march</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in billets. By the time that the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treat had ended lie had changed greatly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked years older, tired, dispirited. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cool enough in action, that was evident,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost too cool. At a glance it seemed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he held himself in check. He was cheer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful, after a fashion; he still talked in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same amusing, self-assertive manner; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore, without murmuring or showing him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self impatient, every hardship and discom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort; he showed no sign of weariness nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt of victory'; he was firm with his men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet always kind and considerate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless there remained to Shannon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the memory of the morning when Tony had</seg><seg type="columnLine">chosen dishonor rather than face death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men did run in action, of course. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times even the best were liable to panic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But that Tony Mallagh should have proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself a cow'ard was to Shannon almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he himself had been detected in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> True to his promise, he wrote to Sybil at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first opportunity, a few- lines scribbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in pencil--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Tony is splendid; you have no idea. He is happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and contented, always. I have heard no word of</seg><seg type="columnLine">complaint from him at any time. And he is as</seg><seg type="columnLine">brave in battle as any man could be. The men wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship him. Honestly, you would think to see him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had been fighting all his life. He took to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally, like a duck takes to water. I he best sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">altern in the battalion, that's what they call him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We are all very proud of him. He fights as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were playing football or boxing. Jf you should im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agine from anything he writes to you that he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason to be disappointed or worried, perhaps, do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not pay any attention. It is not true. Wc all of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">think he has done splendidly, from the Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the part about the Colonel was, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he discovered soon after writing, quite true.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the Colonel thought well of Tony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not saying a word against the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 'em," he said, "but Tony Mallagh's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best--far and away the best. 1 m very sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isfied, indeed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir," Shannon nodded. "We've as</seg><seg type="columnLine">good a crowd of subalterns in the South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irish as you'd want."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And he's not foolish like young O'Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nell, for instance. O'Connell er--seems all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time bent on--well, on showing off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony Mallagh's sound. Looks after his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, keeps 'em in hand, won't let 'em kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves off just for effect. And you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know yourself, Shannon, what that means</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a crowd like we've got. No, I'm very</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased with young Mallagh, very pleased,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed. He's steadied down immensely of</seg><seg type="columnLine">late--since he's been married, in fact. Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife he's got, too. Very good! Yes, I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased with him. He'll go far.1'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, as Shannon discovered, the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of a like opinion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE regiment had halted for a brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest one night and the men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bivouacked in a large field. The ri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fles were stacked; the smoke of the fires</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted upward; the sky was a dull orange</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the west. Men were scattered about on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grass, smoking or sleeping, worn out. by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day's toil, waiting for their evening meal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon coming in from the pickets stop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped to speak to the company Sergeant-Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jor. He had said all he had wanted to, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to move off, when the voices of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a group of men seated only a few yards dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant drew his attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did ye see him today whin owld Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ginnis was like to dhrop with fatigue, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet worn to ribbons by the dint of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marchin' we're afther havin'?

Wait till he gits angry."</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WOMAN AT THE FARM</seg><seg type="columnLine">LATE in the afternoon Tony Mallagh</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some dozen or so men strung out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in open order, made their way down a steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooded hill-slope toward a small farm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tucked away in the narrow valley. The day</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very hot and still, the sky a deep blue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flecked with white clouds. Guns thundered</seg><seg type="columnLine">incessantly in the distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the edge of the wood, where the trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew thin, Tony halted and let his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">wander from right to left, suspicious of</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger. Across a field of bleached stubble</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay the farmhouse, small and white, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-tiled roof, overgrown with moss and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ivy, and showing no sign of life save the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin trickle of smoke from the chimney.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond was a large barn and outbuildings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a well and an apple-orchard. Further off</seg><seg type="columnLine">again were more trees and the ridge that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made up the opposite slope of the valley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Purty as a pictliure," said one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. "Sure, it puts me in mind of Kerry."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't see any one around, do you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sergeant-Major?" said Tony. "But we'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">better be careful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There'll be no Germans lift this way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorr, if that's what ye mane."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a cow yonda, sorr. By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">threes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think," said Tony deliberately, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll investigate. Corporal Birkett, you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Kelly, you, just work 'round to the left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">will you. O'Connor and Madden bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to the right." He paused. "And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think the rest of us can risk walking right</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the front door."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mebbe there'll be such a thing as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dhrink o' milk to be had for the axin',"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said a private cheerfully. "Or beer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they drew near the house, a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the door and stood looking toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with a hand shielding her eyes from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glare of the sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">2</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "I wondher now can she sphake English?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said the Sergeant-Major doubtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Niver yit do I remimber meetin' anny</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wan what cudn't, save an' ixciptin' that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gerrman orf'cer what we caught in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dhrain two mornin's back--him that swore</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so fluent in his own tongue whin Tim Dolan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dhropped his rifle on top of him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Tony opened the little wooden gate and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">walked up the path between masses of flow-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ers. When he was within a few paces of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woman he halted and saluted. She looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at him with a grave face and then as if re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">assured gave a little nervous bow. A small</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">girl ran out and clung shyly to her skirts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">From the back of the house there arose the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">frantic barking of a dog and the voice of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Private O'Connor uttering soothing sounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Racking his memory for the right words,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tony began to speak in French, slowly and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">badly. The woman laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "N'imporU," she said. "Jc park An-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">glais--a little. Is it not so? And, monsieur</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is English?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Tony nodded, surprised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  From behind his back came a low whis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">per.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "She's makin' a big mistake. It's Irish</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we are. South Irish. Corrk, Tipperary'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The place it's a long way to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Have you had any Germans here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">asked Tony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She shook her head. They had seen no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">soldiers at all. Not one. No Germans had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">come into the valley. Not yet at least. Nor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would they. Not now. She made a little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gesture of contempt with her hands. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were going. Like frost before the sun. She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had no fear of Germans. Why should she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have? She was only a woman, doing the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">work that the good God had pven her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Who would harm her? Not even the Ger-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But," said Ton&gt;% "are you here all by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yourself? Aren't there any men--belonging</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the place? Haven't you a husband?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">To Tony it seemed impossible that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">. woman should be living with her children</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone in the midst of a battle. Surely she</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have some man who could help, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">help were needed!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Her husband! The woman laughed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">proudly. Where would he be at such a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time? He was fighting--pour Ij painc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She hoped, she said, that he was killing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Germans. He had left her when war broke</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out. She might not see him again till the</seg><seg type="columnLine">is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boches were driven back across the Rhine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he shuuld die-- She gave a shrug of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders. "Monsieur, soyez certain qiie</seg><seg type="columnLine">qu'il mourra bicn."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no man nearer the farm, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">added, than those in the little town across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hill, only her father. But would the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer care to step inside and see for him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self? He saw strangers seldom, her father.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would cheer him up. Also, there was milk</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be had, and some cider, and perhaps an</seg><seg type="columnLine">egg or so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony glanced at the little group of dirty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unshaven Irishmen in their war-Worn khaki.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Telford," he said to the Sergeant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Major, "come along in, and see what her</seg><seg type="columnLine">father's like. Queer, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They entered the house. In the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen which was very clean and neat, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stone floor and low ceiling and a row of red</seg><seg type="columnLine">geraniums in llower-pots on the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">window-sill, there sat a withered little old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, with bowed shoulders and wrinkled</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and bright eyes. He smiled at Tony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but made no attempt to rise from the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair in which he was seated in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bon jour, vi'sicu'," said Tony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little old man, who was dressed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">black and about whose legs was a shawl of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some reddish plaid stuff, nodded and smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said a few words in a high, thin voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">so quickly that Tony could not grasp their</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning. He turned to the woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He helps you in the work, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shook her head, as if such a thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">were unheard of.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Once. Not now. See, monsieur." And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then Tonv, seeing the crutches leaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall, understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'Toor old chap, I'm sorry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman's face clouded suddenly. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sad. He was helpless, able to walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">only with such pain and labor. Helpless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since five years now he had done nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was not old, but he had aged greatly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His grief when war came--ah. but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible! In 1870 he had been too young to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight; now he was unable. She spoke to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little mar. and he smiled at her and nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aren't y&lt;*u afraid to stay here, so near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lighting?" asked Tony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if 1 left, monsieur, who would look</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the farm? The men go to the war for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their country's safety, and honor. May not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman work? Where would the harvest</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been but for me? And I am strong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">monsieur, as strung almost as my man him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self who is a soldier." She laughed. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I left, munsieur, where would I go?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also--" she nodded toward the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of the room where in a cradle between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window and a tall oak dresser lay a buby</seg><seg type="columnLine">soundly sleeping--"one has responsibilities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is it not? And where should I go? To</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris! No, monsieur. If my man returns</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tinds me gone, what would he think?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Does a soldier desert his regiment, or his</seg><seg type="columnLine">flag? No more does a woman desert her</seg><seg type="columnLine">home. I have my duty, even as mv hus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">band. If I stay here no one will do me harm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A woman with two little ones is safe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony watched her while she spoke. Hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, and she must have worked hard .since</seg><seg type="columnLine">her husband left, had not stolen away her</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks. She was well built, not tall, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight and strong and slender. Her skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a warm dusky bronze, with a rich red</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her cheeks; her hair was a golden l»r .. n;</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes were blue. Once she must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been pretty he was certain. She war that</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, indeed, if she were nicely dressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman was filling a jug from a cask</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stood by the dresser, still chattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">away in her queer, clipped English, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to have the chance to air her knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cider was good, she said, of her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">making. Her husband had said that her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cider was better than any. And he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge. She straightened her back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed happily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then like the flashing of a search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light in the darkness it came over Tony that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was something about her, an indefina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble something, that put him in mind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sybil. His lips twisted into a little smile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusement at the fancy. Like Sybil! But.</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, that was ridiculous! Was he to</seg><seg type="columnLine">compare a French farmer's wife with Sybil?</seg><seg type="columnLine">As well might he compare Telford, strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">and active and healthy, with the little crip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple in the arm-chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But was the fancy, as he had termed it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so foolish? She did not resemble Sybil in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very least and yet there was a likeness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her eyes were the same blue, her hair was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same golden-brown. Even her laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the same joyous freshness as had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sybil's. And when asked a question of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she was not quite sure, she had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same trick of raising her eyebrows before</seg><seg type="columnLine">answering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Tony Mallagh</seg><seg type="columnLine">19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moreover, there was the certainty that</seg><seg type="columnLine">as this girl had spoken of her husband</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighting for his country, so also would Sybil</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The French woman approached, a glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cider in each hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, perhaps, monsieur would prefer</seg><seg type="columnLine">some wine?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony shook his head. The cider would do</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you're not afraid to be here by</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself?" he asked. "It's very brave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, but I think somehow it's running a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great risk. You're so very near the fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. And we don't know which way it may</seg><seg type="columnLine">go"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shrugged her shoulders. The good</seg><seg type="columnLine">God would preserve her. She knew it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No harm would come if she stayed at home</seg><seg type="columnLine">and did the work of the farm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony set down his empty glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very good, indeed," he said. "Tres</seg><seg type="columnLine">bon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman held out the jug. Would</seg><seg type="columnLine">monsieur care for some more then? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook h?s head and smiled. No, he had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficieni. They ought to be moving on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If she had a glass or so to spare for the men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, he would be grateful. She nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and led the way out of the little kitchen into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sunshine where the soldiers were waiting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While they drank she watched them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an air of pride and good-nature, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony offered to pay, refused firmly. No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were fighting for France, for her, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her children. Money, no! It was a pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony beckoned to the little girl and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she came to him, smiling shyly, put a gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">coin into her tiny palm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Merci, m'sieu'," she said, and running</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her mother hid her rosy cheeks in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where did you learn English?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony suddenly. "You speak very well in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed. Have you been in England?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed and shook her head. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">England! No, never. What little English</seg><seg type="columnLine">she knew, she had learned from an English</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady and gentleman for whom she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooked in Paris. A fine couple, generous to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a degree, but so simple! They had stayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Winter and Spring in Paris to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">French. They had learned no more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few words, that went without saying, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">--again she shrugged her shoulders--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she herself, she had had to learn English.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And she laughed once more, as if it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greatest joke in the world, and as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men before her were her own friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">and countrymen, and not soldiers of another</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation on active service, warning her that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fighting was near and might come</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Tony, "we must go now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe we'll see you again. Au revoir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">madame, and good luck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went away, past the bam and sheds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the orchard at the back of the house to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wooded slope on the opposite side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they reached the foot of the hill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony turned and looked back. The little</seg><seg type="columnLine">farm with its meadows and orchard was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">some quiet haven far from the world's</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble and turmoil. For the first time since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning when he had left home, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stolen into Tony Mallagh's conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness a sense of restfulness and peace. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no war. Men no longer killed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded each other to show their love for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their countries. The booming of the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns that never ended became as the mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">muring of waves on the shore. In the valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">one might live and be happy. Even he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony Mallagh, of the South Irish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as he gazed he saw the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing at the back of the house. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved his hand in farewell, and with a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">sigh followed his men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Funny, isn't it," he said to the company</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sergeant-Major, "that a woman should</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop here all alone with fighting so near!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plucky of her, of course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is so," said Telford. "But I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">think in' she's as safe where she is as she'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">be if she moved We've no manes of know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in' how matthers are goin' yit, but from</seg><seg type="columnLine">what we have seen this past few days, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way we're afther pushin' ahead, it luks</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the Germans can do nothin' but go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, where they come from."'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time Tony said nothing. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke again they were nearing the crest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's rough on her having to be by her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, isn't it? And she! so everlastingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerful. That's what beats me. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't think her husband was away</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting, would you? He may be dead by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time for all she knows, too.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And once more he thought of Sybil, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, wondering if he were still alive, hop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and trusting, yet never knowing what</seg><seg type="columnLine">20</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute might bring the news that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take from her life all hope of happiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's harrd on the women, is war," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Telford. "You an' me, sorr, we're men, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">what do we know what fears that poor sowl</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in the valley yonda is sufferin'? An'</seg><seg type="columnLine">what's more, we'll niver see her again to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out what's become of her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this the Sergeant-Major was wrong.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT night Tony found a letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Sybil awaiting him, the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had had at the front.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dearest:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am wondering where you will be when you get</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, or if indeed you will get it at all. I have heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">from you four times already, and when your hist</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter was written you had not liad so much as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">line from me. But, dear, 1 have written more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen times. You don't think, Tony dear, that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't, do you? I hate to think of your wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I don't write, for I did, Tony, really and truly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I sent oil parcels of socks and shirts, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights will be cold out of doors. And there were also</seg><seg type="columnLine">some cigarettes and cake and chocolate. I do hope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dearest, that something has reached you by now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have no news. And the little I have had I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you in my other letters. If you have had them you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will know. But it's nothing more than each day the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same as the day before. I am very happy with Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Came. She is a perfect dear. We do a good deal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sewing and knitting, socks and things, for the troops.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And we read the papers, all of them, and are so</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud to hear that the South Irish have done so</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. We heard there was a wounded soldier at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">London Hospital who belonged to the South Irish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so we went to see him. He was a man called</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Sullivan, in Mr. Packman's platoon, and so inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esting. He had seen you in the retreat after Mons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he said that you were so brave and cheerful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kind. Oh, my dear, my dearl I nearly cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he told us. You are having such hardships</seg><seg type="columnLine">out at the front, and here am I at home, safe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">living in comfort while you are lighting. It seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony, I never realized how much you were--are</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me while I had you at home. Now, I know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're everything, my dear, everything. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes I wake up at night with a start and</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine I can hear the guns in the distance and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder whether you arc lying out in the open, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it is raining and cold, and where you are. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear, you are never out of my thoughts. I pray</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you night and morning, and sweetheart--don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh dear--whenever I've nothing particular to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do, whenever I find myself with a minute or two lo</seg><seg type="columnLine">spare--and that's very often, alas!--I say little</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayers to God that He will bring you back'to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know He will. I feel certain. And I know, love,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you will fight bravely and make your men feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was so glad to know that they liked and admired</seg><seg type="columnLine">you so much. Sullivan, poor chap, has lost both</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms. Isn't it awful? I do not know what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">will do when he gets birttcr. We are hoping that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government pension will be really enough for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his wife lo live on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, dear, I must end. I do pray that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruel war may soon be over, and that the South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irish will help lo win the victory that is coming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And l he day can't come too :*&gt;on. Tony mine, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shall see you again. But I am so proud of you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony dear. And I just hate and despise any man</seg><seg type="columnLine">that at the present Lime will not see that he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted, and that it is his duty to train and prepare</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to fight for his Country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With love, old boy, and heaps of good luck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from SvbiL.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> P. S.--Poor Mrs. keane! I was so sorry for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she had news that her husband was taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">risoner. She was so sad about it. But I comforted</seg><seg type="columnLine">er by saying that there was one thing good in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">news, and that was that he was safe at least. If be</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a prisoner of war he would at least be out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting. And that cheered her up quite a lot. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear that his wound is not as bad as it might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been. Major Came wrote and told her. But she</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that it was such a blow on poor Captain Keane</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be out of everything from now on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony read and reread the letter. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could almost see Sybil as she wTote it, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that though far away in the flesh, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit she was very near. Had he ever real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized properly, in the past, in those few short</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream-weeks when they had been man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife, the depth of feeling in a woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart? The letter told him far more fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the mere words could express what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sybil thought of him, how much her happi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness depended on his safe return. Suppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sing he were killed! It almost hurt him, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">some physical pain, to think what life w ould</seg><seg type="columnLine">be for her, the loneliness, the dreariness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If it wfas bad now, what would it be ii he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dead?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He folded the letter and placed it in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocketbook. What was the use of fretting?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Worry- would only make things the harder</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bear. Because his country was at war he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must risk his life. A feeling of sick help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessness came over him. He might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed at any moment of the day or</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing could save him. Nothing, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">to turn and run. And would that help?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sybil was proud of him. Proud! Oh, God!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Proud of a man who was a coward at heart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had deserted his post in battle, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to fight his own fears at ever}' turn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And at that the helplessness gave way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fierce anger.--war! Why should a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, a free man, consent to do what his</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole being loathed. Why? Because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to. Because there was no escape. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hullo, young feller, why the mirth?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon, big and broad and smiling, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the little room. Tony felt a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Tony Mallagh</seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg><seg type="columnLine">envy. What cares had Shannon? Shan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">non had no one at home depending on him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shannon went into action free from anxiety.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What did Shannon know of the sorrow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grief of parting?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just heard from Sybil," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah!" Shannon's square, sunburnt face</seg><seg type="columnLine">became very serious. "Ah! and how is she?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fit, I hope."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think so," said Tony. "Seems to be.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She's a little worried, of course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course!" said Shannon, and he nod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ded his head once or twice as if he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand and sympathize, which, thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony bitterly, was the one thing a man like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shannon could not do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He understand? He sympathize? Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shannon had no more feeling about him</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a graven image! His whole existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bound up in the regiment. Anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond had no interest. A good chap, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">much Tony granted, a splendid soldier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">none better, a brave man, but in some ways</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely stupid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon seated himself on a high-backed</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair at the opposite end of the table. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was rather dark, lit only by one dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">oil	lamp, hanging from the ceiling. Red-hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">embers glowed in the small grate; occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sionally ashes fell into the hearth. In a cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner wrapped in a blanket one of the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">subalterns was sleeping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony raised his eyes to find Shannon</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing at him with a puzzled expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aren't you going to get any sleep to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, Tony?" he asked. "It's latish, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, and we're as likely as not to be routed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up by four."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dunno'," said Tony. "I'm not tired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As a matter of fact, I'm not sleeping very</seg><seg type="columnLine">well these nights."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh!'' Shannon grunted. "Why don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you speak of it then, eh? You can't do much</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you're not sleeping, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a minute or so there was silence in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little room. Tony rested his chin on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knuckles and gazed at the blue of the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">that showed through the open window and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pondered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Why had Shannon said that he could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">no good unless he slept? Did that mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was in fact doing badly? Were</seg><seg type="columnLine">people talking of him behind his back?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was the secret, that he had guarded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">such jealous care, common property in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">regiment? Had Shannon known all along</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had run from the Germans in panic?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had he known that his excuse of rallying</seg><seg type="columnLine">his men had been untrue? Perhaps even</seg><seg type="columnLine">now he pitied him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaned forward, seized with a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">determination to learn the worst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Would you mind if I asked you a ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, sir? It's rather important."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ask away, son. Nothing wrong, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well--well--" Tony reddened. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">harder than he had expected. "Well, sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's this: How do you think I'm doing?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I think you're doing very well," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shannon deliberately. "Very' well, indeed. '</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony considered. The answer was satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">factory, as far as it went. Did it go far</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you seen anything to make you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think I don't care for fighting, sir? Or that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm afraid when we're in action?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Afraid!" said Shannon. "Nonsense!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">But to himself he said: "Now, what's he</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving at? What is it he's trying to tell me?-'</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sometimes," said Tony, "I think I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">scared."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nine-tenths of the men who go under</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire for the first time are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you wouldn't call me a coward,''</seg><seg type="columnLine">persisted Tony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon frowned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the devil's wrong with you to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, Tony? A coward! No. Don't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">an idiot! You're as good as any man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">regiment. I'll tell you one thing, though,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that is-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shot a quick glance at Tony. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't mind my speaking plainly, do you? '</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Very glad, sir, if you would," said Tony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his heart began to beat a trifle faster.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But now that his doubts were set at re?t,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shannon might say whatever he choose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Compared with what he had thought, noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing mattered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not quite sure what it is," continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shannon, "or whether indeed it's anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all, but you give the impression, Tony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of--well, of not being interested in vour</seg><seg type="columnLine">work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony nodded nervously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm interested enough, in a way." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped short, wondering what in the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shannon meant. Not interested! I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite understand," he said. "I shouldn t</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the war to go on forever, sir, of course."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nobody would," said Shannon dryly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's the uselessness of the whole thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I hate most," said Tony.</seg><seg type="columnLine">") ■&gt;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is that the sum total of your impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions?" asked Shannon. "I'd Like to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you really do think about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It s hard to say," said Tony, and he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather uncomfortable and ill at ease. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">a soldier and 1 have to light. That I know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But--why should I have to kill Germans?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't hate them. All I can think of in</seg><seg type="columnLine">action is that the men we're pumping lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">into, the men who are try ing to attack us</seg><seg type="columnLine">and are being wiped out, are men like we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are; that there are wives in Germany wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for news--wives and mothers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughters--just as Sybil at home waits</seg><seg type="columnLine">for news of me. Poor devils! It makes me</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick to see the way they go down when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack in those masses of theirs. It's mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. Poor wretched conscripts! And being</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven on by their officers. You've seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, eh? Like tattle being driven to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaughter-house. Why?" He ended ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon was bewildered, out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">depth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "D'you mean to tell me, Tony Mallagh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you go into action with thoughts like</seg><seg type="columnLine">those. Good Lord, man, it's a mystery to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me you don't take to your heels and bolt!''</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw the sudden shame and fear in Tony's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, and hurried on. "Don't you realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">that those fathers and husbands and broth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers of yours are doing their darn'dest to kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and me and the rest of us? You kill or</seg><seg type="columnLine">be killed. There's no other alternative.</seg><seg type="columnLine">D" you think they'd have any mercy on</seg><seg type="columnLine">you just because you've a wife at home?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No-o," said Tony doubtfully. "Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came into Shannon's mind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory of the conversation he had over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard some nights before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tony," he said. "War's not a game.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's dead earnest. There's only one way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to end it quickly and that's by smashing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men we're fighting. Half measures won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. You're too - casual about it. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder what you'd be like if you got angry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If you're thinking how hard it is on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germans to be wiped out by our chaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll never do any good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And, Tony, remember this: though</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're in France you're fighting to keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germans out of your own country. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're lighting for Sybil. And if you'll take</seg><seg type="columnLine">my advice you'll get angry and fight as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">every German was a personal, particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy of your own who was trying to smash</seg><seg type="columnLine">up your home and all that you have. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you do that, if you once lose your temper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see red, well--remembering the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the greengrocer's horse and the light at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portsmouth, you'll be hard to beat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony sighed a trifle wearily. Shannon</seg><seg type="columnLine">had meant to be kind, of course. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't understand. How could he?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for the advice he had given, it was use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less. Had he not enough to do as it was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without worrying his head about matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of no importance? With heartfelt thankful-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness he realized that his secret was safe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But for how long? The foe that he fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not the German army', neither horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor foot nor guns, but himself. Would the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day ever come when he could claim the</seg><seg type="columnLine">victory? The knowledge of what he really</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, sickened him. For Sybil's sake he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">live; for Sybil's sake he must overcome his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laughed abruptly', and then forced a</seg><seg type="columnLine">yawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord! I'm tired. I think I'll turn in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir. It was awfullyr good of you to ha e tol :l</seg><seg type="columnLine">me all that. I'll remember.'' He stood up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and collected his b elongings. ' ' Hope there 11</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a mail soon again. It's like Heaven</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing from home occasionally'. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the worst of being out here--you're lost."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the last thing he saw as he dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">off to sleep was Shannon seated in the high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed chair, his elbows on the table, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head propped by his hands, as one deep in</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE HARVEST</seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE three days that followed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the battle continued with un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abated fury', stretching over a vast frontage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the South Irish Fusiliers saw but little of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the actual fighting, being in reserve. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">this Tony was devoutly thankful. The rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">put fresh heart into him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then one morning when the mists</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fading before the sun, a platoon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent forward to reconnoitre and occupy' a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill. Thus it was that shortly' before noon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony Mallagh saw from the slope of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickly-wooded ridge the small valley and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the farm and remembered once more the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman who had reminded him of Sybil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I w'onder if there've been anyr Germans</seg><seg type="columnLine">around since we were here last," he said, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a corporal standing near him shook his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Tony Mallagh</seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "By the luk of the house, sorr, 'tis the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Maybe it is," said Tony, "but it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be worth our while making sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They pushed their way through thickets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tangled undergrowth, under the shade</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tall oaks, as fair and full of God's glory</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if the grim carnage of war were but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mortal dream, until in a clearing lit by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, half-way down the hill, they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">across a man who lay on his back, a High-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lander, liis blind eyes staring up into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue, his face set in a mocking smile, a line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blood marking his last, lonely pilgrimage</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony shivered. The men had halted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were waiting, uncertain, peering through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen of trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, I wonder," said Tony half to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, "I wonder what brought him here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poor devil!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "He wasn't killed here, sorr," said Tel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford. "It was on the top of the hill he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded, he came to the valley to die.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe he was makin' for the farrm."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Tony glanced over his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Corporal Birkett, I'll get you, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Connor, you, to go forward and see if</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's any sign of the enemy. There won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be. They couldn't have got in here, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'd have seen 'em, but we'll make sure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll wait at the edge of the field and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you covered in case-- Understand!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They watched the two men crossing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow stubble. Everything was very still.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The farm seemed even more desolate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forsaken than it had been the first time they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen it. A heavy silence seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">brood over the whole place, a silence that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was broken at intervals by the crash and</seg><seg type="columnLine">re-echoing roar of artillery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Telford uttered a sudden, half-choked</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Luk there, sorr, at the top of the roof,</seg><seg type="columnLine">will ye?

And he hastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">on down the slope in the direction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farm, outstripping his men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the little gate leading to the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden, O'Connor made as if to stop him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Sorr, there's nothin' lift--nothin'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a curt nod Tony passed on and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood at the doorway peering in at what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had only a few short days before, been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt as if some power had robbed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his senses. He saw, but he could not at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tach any meaning to what was before his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. The effect was clear, the cause was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The ceiling and part of the wall opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone. The blue sky and the green trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a shattered bam showed in the gap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The floor, once so white and clean, was cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered with debris, rubble and plaster and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brick and woodwork. The table in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the room was broken. The oak</seg><seg type="columnLine">dresser stood to all appearance undamaged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but its neat rows of crockery ware, the cups</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saucers and dishes and jugs had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast down as if by some gigantic hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">obeying some devil's -will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Tony shook off the stupor that bound him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Against the stove, crumpled up like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle of old clothes, discarded after years</seg><seg type="columnLine">of use, thrown carelessly aside, was the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man, the woman's father, the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearth smeared and splashed with dried</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Tony stared at him with a feeling of cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear gripping his heart. Nor could he have</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken, had he been ordered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were footsteps behind him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and saw Telford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God dheliver us! They're afther shel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin 'kthe place.

Her face was turned away, hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">from view, her shoulders were bowed, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arms she held her baby, with one hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">shielding its head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony approached softly, spoke to her in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a husky voice, then touched her. She did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not move. Great beads of perspiration</seg><seg type="columnLine">trickled down his cheeks, his tongue clove</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the roof of his mouth. And at last, by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort, he found his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?" he asked hoarsely, "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">is it? Tell me, can't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tugged at her arm, tugged and tugged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until unresisting, strangely limp, she moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he saw her face. Her cheeks were pale,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes closed, her white teeth pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into her lower lip, and under the mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy golden hair, hair that was so like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sybil's--Sybil waiting at home for news</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him--was red blood, blood that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">trickled down over her forehead, down her</seg><seg type="columnLine">other cheek, on to the bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unable to bear the sight. Tony dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arm and turned away. His men</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him with curious eyes, silent, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehensive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God!" he whispered. "Oh, my God!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Did you see her?

It isn't my fault, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't, is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He staggered out of the ruined house into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open air, shaking in every limb, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses reeling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The farm-yard was wrecked beyond re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pairing: barns and out-houses were crum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling ruins.

His head was</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbing as with fever. He felt sick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazed. Thoughts came and went haphaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard. A fierce anger burned within him; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatred of war; a horror of what he had seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For he knew, as surely as if he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">told, that never while he had life in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body--never, sleeping or waking, uld he</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget, would he shut out of mind the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen that day. And this was war--</seg><seg type="columnLine">war, the magnificent; war that men wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Sergeant-Major was looking at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a curious intensity of gaze.

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rumors coming from where no man</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, that in the morning the regiment was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be sent into action with the remainder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the division.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To Tony Mallagh, sick at heart, tortured</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his own imaginings, pacing to and fro</seg><seg type="columnLine">by himself, came Shannon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tony, I want to speak to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony halted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he said slowly, "what is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The light of a fire threw a red reflection</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to his worn face. Shannon stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, puzzled by his appearance. He looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">*</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Tony Mallagh</seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill. All the life and strength and resolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hullo! Hullo! What's all this? What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter, Tony?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The matter!" Tony answered in a dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. "The matter, sir. Nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The older man took him by the arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, there is." he said. "Better tell me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps I can help."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony laughed softly. Help! The very</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea amused him. "Shannon," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping his voice. "I'm sick of it. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what's the matter. I'm sick of everything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon whistled under his breath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Steady the Buffs! Come on, Tony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony, gazing across the open fields at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant hills dark against the blue-gray sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if it were over those same hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the South Irish were destined to fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way on the morrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There was a farmhouse in a small val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley," he said. "I was there three days ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't know when I've seen any place I</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liked so much--green woods, yellow corn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields, a farmhouse, covered with ivy, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">orchard. The man was away fighting. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife looked after the farm. You under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand, sib. She did all the work, everything,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wasn't frightened. She had an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">father, a cripple, and two kiddies. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germans wouldn't harm her, she knew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And she was as happy and busy as if there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no war within a hundred miles. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then today-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Shannon quietly. "To-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Today!" said Tony. "We went that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way again. The back of the house was</seg><seg type="columnLine">blown to pieces. A batten,' had had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong range or something. Even the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men might have spotted the farm. Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might have thought-- Oh! God</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows! I don't. I daren't think of it, too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much. The old man was dead. So was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman. She had her arms around her baby</seg><seg type="columnLine">to save it from the shells. The baby was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead. And in the garden was the little girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They didn't let me see her. She was dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course. Oh, yes, she was dead right</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. I hat s what we found when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed there today.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And me--God forgive me! ThereVe</seg><seg type="columnLine">been times when I thought that war brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">out all that was best in man. Today--" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipped his fingers--"today, Shannon, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood what war was. They'd gone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each one of them. Wiped out. Smashed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And at the end of the war, perhaps, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">husband will come home to find--what?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing. Only the grave and a wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, Tony, listen." In spite of himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shannon was troubled. "Tony, you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what war is by this time, don't you? It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruel, yes, but-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Cruel!" said Tony. "So it seems.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shannon, I wish you could have seen that</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor girl today, with the shell wound in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and her arms around her poor dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby. What harm had she done? None</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all. She thought she was safe. Who'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch a poor woman who had to work hard?</seg><seg type="columnLine">God would preserve her. That's what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. And a battery two miles away, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps, killed her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'LL never forget, Shannon. Never.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, Shannon, when I saw her that first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, it came over me that she looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sybil. Yes. It's a fact. Like Sybil. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes it worse. War's killing women and</seg><seg type="columnLine">little children and old men. Shells dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">on little houses. What's it matter to us?</seg><seg type="columnLine">We re men and we're strong. War's good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It gives us a chance to win medals and Y.</seg><seg type="columnLine">C.'s and quick promotion. But the women</seg><seg type="columnLine">--God help them! No one else will. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps a' home, in London, Sybil is won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering if I'm alive or dead, or--what? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">--I dunno, I feel that my nerve's broken for</seg><seg type="columnLine">good and all. I'm done."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As bad as that, old chap? " Shannon</seg><seg type="columnLine">patted his shoulder. "Tony, it's no use</seg><seg type="columnLine">fretting. You've got to turn in. And--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll be feeling better in the morning. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">see if you aren't. War's war, old son-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something seemed to snap in Tony's</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain. He laughed harshly and walked oil,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the other staring after him. bewil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered and worried and somewhat frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A square, thick-set figure passed him by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is that you, Telford?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorr." The company Sergeant-Major</seg><seg type="columnLine">saluted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Telford, what's happened 10 Mr. Mal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He was all right this afthernoon. sorr.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Telford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You noticed nothing different about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, sorr, mebbe he was a bit quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">like aithcr we seen where the Gemnans had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">dhropped a few shells on top of a house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An' 1 don't wondher. It wasn't a sight ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">could luk at an' not feel, sorr."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh. I see! Thank you, Telford. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't matter, I thought perhaps he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick, that's all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Sergeant-Major drifted off. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">some minutes Shannon did not move. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he pondered on what Tony Mallagh had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, there came to his mind the thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sybil waiting at home and the memory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening when they had sat opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other in the small drawing-room and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard from her own lips why she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted him. Little more than a month</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed since then. It seemed impossi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble. Whole years could not have made</seg><seg type="columnLine">more difference to her husband. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment the future seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shannon dark and dreary, full of misery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and doubt and uncertainty. Supposing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that on the morrow when the South Irish</seg><seg type="columnLine">went into action Tony were once more to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show himself a coward! Supposing that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time there would be no hiding it from others!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Supposing he turned and ran, not in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray of the dawn, but in broad day in full</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of his company! Supposing he ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lived! Would even Sybil consider his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life worth the price he would have to pay?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Yet if ever a man had showed fear in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">words and looks and manner, thatman was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony Mallagh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE HONOR OF THE SOUTH IRISH</seg><seg type="columnLine">TO THE man who does the actual fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, who goes into the firing-line and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rifle and bayonet endeavors to drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">back the foe, a battle is but a grim dream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">incoherent and vague, a series of discon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected incidents. His range of observation</seg><seg type="columnLine">is limited. He knows what is happening in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his immediate neighborhood and nowhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">else. His regiment or brigade may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled forward in a fierce onslaught, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">losses may appal him--surely this is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardest fighting that man has ever seen--</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet the attack may be but a feint, a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretense to cover the real attack elsewhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He and his comrades may be sacrificed</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that others may win. He may be ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to advance and retire, and then to advance</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more, to all appearance without rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. And what he may think a defeat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">judging from what he has seen with his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, from the losses in his own regiment or</seg><seg type="columnLine">company, may be as great a victory as ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">army won.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus it was with the men of the South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irish. For, although they were in the firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, one of the leading regiments in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement, they knew but little of what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">happening, even in their own immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By noon they had reached the shelter of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood where they were told to wait. Later</seg><seg type="columnLine">the German field-guns opened a heavy fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A few men were killed and a few more</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded, and the stretcher-bearers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Murmurs came from the ranks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The curse of Cromwell on all Gerrmans!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where are they now?

One fell on his face and did not move.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the enemy's position in front the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crackle of musketry broke out. Bullets were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wailing and whistling through the air with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound as of a swarm of monstrous ilies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A bugler coughed and slid over into a limp</seg><seg type="columnLine">heap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are you men going?" asked Shan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">non sternly. "Get back at once, do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear? Get back! Right back now!" They</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved sullenly to where they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon w'ondering if anything had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to Tony Mallagh let his eyes wander</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly from side to side. The men lay in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural gully or ditch that zigzagged along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slope of the hill. Some talked in low</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices, others puffed at their pipes in si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence, a few unmindful of the bullets, dozed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sky showed blue in the gaps of the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead. Through the trees wrere glimpses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of meadow's and cornfields and woods, held</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the enemy, all faint and flickering in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat haze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon turned impatiently. Two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were carrying the wounded bugler away on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Tony Mallagh</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  a stretcher. He watched them with a little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  frown. And then he saw the man for whom</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  he had been looking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Seated on a fallen tree-trunk some little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  distance behind the line of waiting soldiers,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  his shoulders bowed, his chin resting on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  palm of his right hand, his elbow resting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  on his knees, was Tony Mallagh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Shannon, stirred at last to take action,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  strode toward him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Tony raised his head as he came up. His</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  face was gray under the brown, worn and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  wretched; lines showed about his eyes and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  mouth. His whole appearance gave the im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  pression of fear, fear that had left him with-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  out energy or strength of mind. Or so it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  seemed to Shannon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    "Tony," he said, and he spoke in a whis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  per so that no one might overhear. "What</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  the devil are you doing here? Why aren't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  you looking after your men? Don't you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  know that they're under fire, and getting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  restless? What's wrong with you?" Shan-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  non's anger flared up, white-hot. Only by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  an effort could he control his voice. "If</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  \ you're a coward, for Heaven's sake don't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  let the men see it. Pull yourself together,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  man. Don't you understand what I'm say-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    The words were strong, but no stronger</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> than the case warranted. The time for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sympathy had gone by. Only shame, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sense that others had guessed his secret,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> would drive Tony to do his duty. Better</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> by far to lose a friend than that that friend</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> should lose the respect not only of others</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> but of himself. And if what he said had no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> effect, then nothing would. The case was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hopeless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Tony stood up slowly and gazed about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> him in a dazed way, as if he had not grasped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the meaning of what was said to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    ^ I ve done nothing, have I?" he muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    "Nothing!" Shannon dug his heel into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the soft moss covered with pine-needles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's just it. You've done nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We re going forward presently to take that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> village, and you've-well got to set an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> example. See! If you're too scared to do</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> what's right, how the blazes do you expect</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> your men to?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Tony understood. Shannon, poor, dense</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fool, thought that he shirked the fight. He,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony Mallagh, afraid! He laughed. After</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> seeing the house with the dead woman who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> had looked like Sybil! He was a soldier,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ghting for his home, for the girl who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dearer to him than anything in the wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't think I'm afraid, do you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shannon?" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Shannon bluntly. "1 do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, man, think of Sybil. It's for her sake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony, as much as ours. How would she like</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear that when you were wanted you</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Tony was smiling, his head slightly tilted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you think I'm afraid, do you? Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">God! After what I saw yesterday. Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, all that I'm afraid of is that the Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mans mayn't wait. That's all. And you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think I'm a coward, do you? Why?'' His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes glinted with a curious anger. "Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of what I was fool enough to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because of a good many things. Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks to start with. I saw you looking like</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are now, once before. I never told you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I never intended to tell you. but I must.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You remember that morning when some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our fellows bolted and I picked you up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">your head all cut? Tony, you were running</seg><seg type="columnLine">then. If you'd only been trying to rally</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men you'd have been back long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">you got as far as all that. Understand!</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's why I'm frightened now. Because</seg><seg type="columnLine">you look the same as you did then."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right!" said Tony. "Sorry if I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">made you think I'm worse than I am. I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">run that time I know. Don't judge me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, by what I was then. Maybe you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that I'm still a coward! I think--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">here he laughed lightly--"I think that I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove you're wrong. And I'm going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove it for Sybil's sake as much as my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well and good," said Shannon. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to hear it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You remember the greengrocer's horse?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Tony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well! What's that got to do with it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, nothing!" said Tony. "Nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon turned and walked off, feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissatisfied and worried and for the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">not quite certain that he had taken the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">course. He had angered Tony, he knew, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt him, yet he had fio great hope that</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he had said would awaken a sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he had gone some little distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked back. Tony was standing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same attitude, head on one side, hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind his back, staring after him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER the day's fight was over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the General in command of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">division rode up and congratulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Suuth Irish Fusiliers, or what remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. They had achieved what in other</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wars would have been deemed the impossi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble. The sacrifice they had made had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in vain. He was proud to remember,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he said, that he himself had served in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ranks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the remnants of the regiment, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare two hundred and fifty men, ragged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">war-worn and tired, stood to attention in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the streets of a battered village and felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">very proud of themselves and very hungry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and very thirsty. As for what they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, that was nothing. They had fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">and driven the enemy before them, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had promised always if the chance were</seg><seg type="columnLine">given them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the General was surprised, they at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least w-ere not. Were they not the Royal</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Irish Fusiliers--the Tipperary Ti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers? In their hearts they pitied the Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mans who had had to face their onslaught.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poor fools! Did they think they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">withstand an Irish regiment with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bayonet?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the last wild rush when they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">launched across open ground at the enemy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">trenches, with their bayonets glinting in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow evening sunshine, the deep roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their cheering swelling loud above the crack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">le of musketry carried a message both to</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend and foe. The South Irish Fusiliers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were charging. A savage exultant yell told</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had met the Germans and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trench was theirs, and the regiments on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side, line after line, took up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout and dashed forward to do their share.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," as the South Irish put it, "we</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the fellas that showed thim the way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An' it was Misther Mallagh what made us</seg><seg type="columnLine">do what we did!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! An' what kind of madness wras it</seg><seg type="columnLine">that dhrove him on?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Himself knows! Did ye see him whin he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back and sthud with the bullets whist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin' all round him, as cool as ye plaze, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">axed if we was wishin' to live foriver an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">was it a tay-parthy or a battle we wanted?</seg><seg type="columnLine">A gran' young orf'cer an' no mistake!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Indade, an' ye sphake no more than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thruth. But it was not a tay-parthy a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">wants more than wance in a lifetime. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cosht was a dale too high.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had lost heavily from the very mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that the word had sent them forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the shelter of the wood toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germans. Their advance through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">harvest fields and meadows and orchards</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been stubbornly contested. They lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">their colonel, shot] through the lungs, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">major, two captains and three subalterns.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No more than six officers, unwounded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">survived..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And always in the very forefront of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle went Tony Mallagh, no longer carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a sword, but a rifle and bayonet, fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">in attack, savagely intolerant of delay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern, implacable, and disdainful of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once, when the regiment had carried a</seg><seg type="columnLine">village after fierce hand-to-hand fighting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the streets and houses, and the men of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">company had swarmed around him, cheer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wildly, he had glared at them with cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and growled angrily, like some dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbed of a bone. The stupor of battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'hich is worse than drunkeness held him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its grip. Did they know that the were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasting time or not? he had said. Were</seg><seg type="columnLine">they tired of being soldiers, or what?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would they like their tea and cakes now, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">would they wait till later when the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">was laid and their bibs were ironed?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All these things and others were remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered of him after he had led the last charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Late in the afternoon the brigade crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stream in the face of heavy fire and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, driving the Germans before them</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun was setting by the time they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared the wood of its defenders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A strange hush had fallen on the field of</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle, a hush that w-as broken only by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incessant roar of the guns. Yet the men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the South Irish streaming onward, grimly</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent, knew that the real struggle was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">before them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the edge of the wood they found in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of them a stretch of open ground, slop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing slightly upward, bare of all cover, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce storm of bullets from the hedgerows</seg><seg type="columnLine">and orchards and houses swept their ranks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They fell back in disorder to the shelter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the trees. Urged to fresh effort by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers, they poured in volley after volley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started forward once more, only to</seg><seg type="columnLine">waver and break and go back, leaving be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind their dead. German marksmanship</seg><seg type="columnLine">they despised, but this hell of fire from rifles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and machine-guns wfas more than man bom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of woman could face and live. Or so they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thought. All that soldiers could do they</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Tony Mallagh</seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done. They must wait for reinforce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this time Tony Mallagh, bare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed, grimed with sweat and dirt, but as</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool and calm as on parade, smiling a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">so men said later when they talked it over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not retire with his company. He stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">by himself, a mark for a half-score of</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine-guns, perhaps more, and rifles</seg><seg type="columnLine">without number, upright in the midst of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fallen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men had watched him, wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">when would come the bullet that would lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">him low. Some had shouted for him to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, that he would be killed, that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves could not shoot for fear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitting him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Are you afraid, then, South Irish?" be</seg><seg type="columnLine">had laughed. "Do you want German con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scripts to boast that they licked you in fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight? Are you so fond of your miserable</seg><seg type="columnLine">carcases?" Here he had raised his hand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face and they had seen the red smear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood. Again he had laughed. "Good-by,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then. I'd be ashamed to be seen dead in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the company of a pack of-cowards like</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are! And you call yourself Irish! I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud to know that you'll not go where I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He turned with a little gesture of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt and walked deliberately toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy, rifle in hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A young subaltern shouted, "Don't let</seg><seg type="columnLine">him go alone, South Irish!" Jumping to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet he started after him but fell with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet through his heart. A dozen men fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">^r] ONE after another they dropped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And after that not even discipline,</seg><seg type="columnLine">n°t even direct orders from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers, would have held back the South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irish. Cowards, were they! They would</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove that whatever they might be they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were far from being cowards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they went forward with the wild,</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage yell that gave warning far and wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the coming of the bayonets, Tony Mal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agh glanced back over his shoulder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed. Then he began to run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Men fell by scores in the rush across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open; he was not touched. Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine-guns nor rifles brought him down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bleeding from his wound he reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">German position well in advance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest man. Using both the butt of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle and his bayonet, he fought his way into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trench. A swarm of gray-clad figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to rise up and engulf him. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was the last seen of Tony Mallagh for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a wave breaking on a rock-bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore, the South Irish burst through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy. Those that awaited their coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">died. Those that fled they chased through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the streets of the little village. A few es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caped, but not many. It was a fight after</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own hearts, a great and glorious fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That the South Irish Fusiliers existed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer save as a mere fragment of a battal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion mattered not. No other troops could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done what they had done. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud of themselves, and justly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Telford and a couple of wounded privates</seg><seg type="columnLine">found Tony Mallagh under a pile of corpses</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the orchard at the back of the trench.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "He's dead, poor fella!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Indade, an' he's not. Not yit, at laste.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mother of God! Luk at the wounds that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony opened his eyes as Shannon came</seg><seg type="columnLine">up through the trees. He dropped on to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees by Tony's side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tony, old man, are you badly hurt?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurt!-' whispered Tony. "No."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lay on the grass under the trees, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head in Telford's lap. And seeing him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no one present who did not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the end must be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take it aisy, sorr. There'll be a docthor</seg><seg type="columnLine">along in a minute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Tony, Tony!'' said Shannon bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "S'sh! What's that?'' From their left</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a deep roar of cheers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're afther takin' another trinch."</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Telford. "That ull be the Cumber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shannon," said Tony, "I can't live, LI</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. I want to, and yet--yet somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't. It was the house and the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was killed--remember! And the green-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grocer's horse at Portsmouth." His mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be wandering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not long now," muttered Telford.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not very long, poor bhov!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a while no one spoke. The cheering</seg><seg type="columnLine">had died down. Only the sullen boom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field-guns thudded on. The sun had</seg><seg type="columnLine">set and the sky was a brilliant crimson over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hills. .Another regiment was passing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rank after rank of dark figures against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluish-gray of the trees. The dying man</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred uneasily, and Shannon bent nearer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that he might catch the least whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wasn't afraid, Shannon, was 1? 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't this time, at least. I was before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though.1'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Afraid!" said Shannon. "I never saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything so splendid in all my life. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have won the trench but for you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony. We couldn't have."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something's fretting him," said Telford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tony," said Shannon suddenly, "is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there any message for--for Sybil?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sybil!" said Tony. "Sybil!" He stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Shannon with a look of doubt, almost as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the words he had heard held no meaning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Is there nothing I can do?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surely he would be thinking of Sybil, think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and wondering and worrying! Surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would help him if he knew that any mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage he might give would reach her! "She'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be very proud of you, Tony," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A wistful little smile crept into Tony's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you understand, Shannon, I'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing her myself? I'll tell her--yes, I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell her everything. Good and bad, eh?</seg><seg type="columnLine">She'll be glad, won't she?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon caught his breath sharply. Poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Tony! He was going out at last then.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Did he think, though, that he could live to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see Sybil?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's wandherin' a thrifle," whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Telford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one spoke. The end was very near.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then with ari effort Tony tried to raise him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. A gleam of amusement showed in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dirty work, fighting," he murmured.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Glad I didn't order a new kit, eh?" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little group waited for a while in si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence. Then Telford lowered the boy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head on to the grass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's gone," he said. "An' but for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">we wouldn't be where we are now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God help the girl!" said Shannon</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarsely. "It's hard on her.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up.

The room</seg><seg type="columnLine">still bore the marks of fighting. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boards were dark stains. Bullet holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarred the plaster of the walls. German</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifles and helmets lay in one corner. A sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dier servant was lighting a lamp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon seated himself at the table and</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched in his pockets for pen and writing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tablet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If he must write, it would be as well to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Tony Mallagh</seg><seg type="columnLine">31</seg><seg type="columnLine">write while he had the chance.

He passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it over to Shannon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The handwriting seemed strangely fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliar. Suannon frowned as he tried to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member where he had seen it before. An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other letter, lying on the table caught his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the same as this, isn't it?" he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, good Lord!

The words were all blurred and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain. Then the mist cleared. And a sick</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror came over him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">32</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not a long letter; just a few lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were to have brought grief and sad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and suffering, the greatest he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever know, to Tony Mallagh. Sybil was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead. The illness had been short. Indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been no illness at all. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said she was tired and had lain down on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed to rest. Later, when they came to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her, she was dead. So the Major's wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">had written. She grieved more than she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could say. She knew what it would mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one so fur away, yet she had thought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">her duty to write.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The letter fell from Shannon's lingers on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor. He stared blindly across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, seeing nothing, only the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl whom he had loved, smiling tenderly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her blue eyes full of sadness and pity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rested his head in his hands and tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some one touched him on the shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A voice spoke to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Why wouldn't they leave him alone?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Couldn't they see that his heart was bro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ken? Didn't they know that the girl--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweetest and dearest girl in the world was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then something seemed to rise up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">choke him. Sybil was dead, yes. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">would that make any difference--to him?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why? She was Tony's wife, and nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him at all. Her husband was dead, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was dead, and no one could wish ihings</seg><seg type="columnLine">different from what they were. And Tony</seg><seg type="columnLine">--Tony had said that he w'ould see her soon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was no message. Why? Had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">know n just at the last, or what?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shannon lowered his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he said huskily. "Yes, did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say anything?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it bad news you have in the letter?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked the little Quartermaster. "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookin' ill."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bad!" said Shannon fiercely. "Bad!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good God, no! Why, it's the best news</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've ever had in my life. Sybil--Tony Mal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagh's wife is dead. You understand? She's</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead. And I'm glad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rose to his feet and walked slowly out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the darkness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">AN</seg><seg type="columnLine">OCCASIONAL</seg><seg type="columnLine">HERO</seg><seg type="columnLine">M J Vi°htman</seg><seg type="columnLine">T MAY have been his unkempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance, or it may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the slouch in his manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he casually supervised the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of a gang of Filipino truckmen, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps it was a combination of the two which</seg><seg type="columnLine">irritated W'hite, the chief of the Lighthouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">Service.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "WTiy do you hire such fellow's?" he snap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped, indicating with slight backward nod</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his head the lanky American in dirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">khaki.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Farley, the assistant purchasing agent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed with his glance the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">White's nod.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh," he said, "partly because we need</seg><seg type="columnLine">m</seg><seg type="columnLine">An Occasional Hero</seg><seg type="columnLine">33</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and partly because this Bureau is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of charity organization. That particu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar one, Cropsey, was wished on us by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Governor-General's office. He's an ex-sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dier, and not a bad sort. He's been here</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a couple of months and hasn't gotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  White's blue eyes glinted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "They don't wish any of them off on me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "I'll have no beach-combers on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pay-roll, and I indicated as much to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Calvin when he sent his first one down. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasn't tried it since."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were young men, as are most work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers in those tropical islands where at forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man usually begins to show unmistakable</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs of wearing out; and they both gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">an impression of self-reliance and absorbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest in their work. But here the resem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blance ended. Farley radiated a good na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture which would make allowances; White</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded of others the machine-like effi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciency which characterized his own work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that's the reason you hold us up</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then in our supplies," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You can't do good work with cheap tools."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farley's reply was interrupted by the ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rival of a motor-car, the panels of w'hose</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors were emblazoned with the eagle-top-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped shield of the Government. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men hurried toward it; and a certain defer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence in their manner told that the genial-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced man who descended was the Govem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">or-General.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As White started to leave, the Governor</seg><seg type="columnLine">detained him with a hand on his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I have just dropped in to pay a friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning call," he said. "Come up with us."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The three mounted the stairs to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">offices, leaving Cropsey the only white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the lower floor of the long concrete</seg><seg type="columnLine">building in which the Government houses</seg><seg type="columnLine">its supplies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He watched them go, a faint flicker of</seg><seg type="columnLine">resentment in his manner. They repre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented success, prosperity, an abundance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the good things of life; he failure--a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was hanging to its outskirts, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, by the slender thread of a five-peso-a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day job. Take that from him today; to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow he would be a beach-comber. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">while with five pesos a day a man can live</seg><seg type="columnLine">m some comfort in Manila, eating the luke-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm chow served by Ah Sing in his dingy</seg><seg type="columnLine">restaurant and sleeping in a cane-bottomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed in a musty room of one of the walled</seg><seg type="columnLine">city s rambling stone houses, he can hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay by enough for his hospital bills when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inevitable sickness strikes him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But if Cropsey's wage had been multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied tenfold he would at the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">month have had little more to show for it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was one of those men born never to</seg><seg type="columnLine">possess anything more substantial than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">roving spirit. Putting money into his pock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ets was like pouring water into a barrel with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hole in its bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was something more than re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentment in his manner this morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a vague uneasiness, brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">about by his consciousness of having vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated the rule of his Bureau which admitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">of no exceptions; and his sin was returning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to plague him. With the purpose of saving</seg><seg type="columnLine">an extra trip to the powder magazine at</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Juan, he had hidden in the building a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small box of dynamite to be shipped that</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon, together with some steel rods,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the engineers at work on the Calao</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge. The box lay in an out-of-the-way</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner, behind some bales of Manila hemp</seg><seg type="columnLine">and straw-filled packing-cases.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While White and Farley had been nosing</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the building, he had been in terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">lest they should discover his infraction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he knew would mean his summary</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismissal. With a sigh of relief he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched them mount the stairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he started for the box, intending to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get rid of it at once; but suddenly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked himself. The Governor-General</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone up with them; he would be coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at any moment, for the Governor did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not pay protracted calls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cropsey scowled as he moved over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the part of the building furthest away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hidden box. A dull rage burned in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. He had the inefficient man's con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt of rules. He felt that he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to save the Government time ancj</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, and instead of receiving thanks for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his zeal, he was in danger of losing his place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A man who is used to getting only rebuffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">from fortune, becomes quick to see his griev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ances. He told himself that hereafter he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do his work and no more, absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more. He almost wished that the box</seg><seg type="columnLine">would catch on fire and blow the building</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its occupants to Kingdom Come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not in answer to Cropsey's wish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but because a brown longshoreman, coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">in from the pier, some forty yards from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the building, had not tossed away his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted cigarette until after he had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">34</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the opening near the hemp, that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to smolder and a spark slowly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">burn its way through the sacking to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the loose straw which had fallen from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">packing-cases.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound of the Governor's voice on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairway caused Cropsey unconsciously to</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance over his shoulder toward the hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive. Tongues of llame were leaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward from the cases, which crackled as</seg><seg type="columnLine">merrily as a Christmas tire, and over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hemp bales a cloud of smoke was forming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR an instant Cropsey gazed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire incredulously; and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a word, he began running</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the building toward the blaze. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">only feeling was one of resentment against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the length of the unpartitioned floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some one who had seen the fire at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same moment raised the cry. Almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">abreast of Cropsey, Farley, followed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Governor, raced to turn the water into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hose, while White hurried to the pier to</seg><seg type="columnLine">summon the fire-launch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a sudden gasp, as the hot air filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lungs, Cropsey hurled himself across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smoldering hemp bales; before him lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deadly box; its sides were smoking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stooping quickly, he lifted it in his arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and began cautiously to make his way be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the burning packing-cases.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The end of his solitary upper garment, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose military coat, brushing against one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cases, took fire. As the flame smote his</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin, he staggered; but in an instant he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught himself and moved forward with</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerky steps, like a mechanical toy, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea now only a few paces distant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through his bloodshot eyes he caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of White running toward him down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roadway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get back, you fool!" he shrieked in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high, sobbing voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something in his tone checked White,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose legs, against the volition of his brain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved him backward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment more and Cropsey felt beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet the rocks which formed the retain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-wall of the sea. Down them he stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered until the water came about his knees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then carefully laying the box in a crevice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rocks, he plunged head-foremost into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea. The awful searing of his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased, but the salt water stung him cruelly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> White, hurrying forward to the man's as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistance, saw as he clambered down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks the box which lay harmless enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the quiet water; and his practised</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye recognized it for what it was. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not pause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here!" he said bending down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretching out one hand while the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">dung to a projecting ledge. "Take hold!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cropsey seized the hand and was drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they reached the roadway the blaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">was out, and Filipino laborers were gingerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling the still smoking hemp bales across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the concrete floor to the open air where a</seg><seg type="columnLine">barefooted too played a stream of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Governor and Farley, who had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the incident without comprehending its</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning, met the pair as they approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building. Cropsey stood facing them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatless, begrimed and dirty; but no one real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized that he had actually been on fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you hurt?" inquired the Governor</seg><seg type="columnLine">solicitously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The feeling of resentment welied up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cropsey intensified in its bitterness. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">back was a live coal, his lungs a glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellows, and this man was asking him</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he was hurt. He shook his head sul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, then, tell us why in the name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that is reasonable you rushed headlong</seg><seg type="columnLine">into that fire?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To Cropsey the world had suddenly token</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the blur of a spinning top. He clenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands in his effort to maintain bis foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; but still he did not answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll tell you why," White cut in crisply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"To get a box of dynamite. Perhaps he will</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell us what it was doing there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Governor's ruddy cheeks paled</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly and he drew a step nearer the fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You did that?" he asked, a new note of</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect in liis voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cropsey made no reply. Instead, he fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward limply, as his legs crumpled under</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, into the Governor's arms which auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matically opened to receive him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beneath his hands the Governor felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's bare skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get me my car quick, and here. Farley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you help me!" he shouted; and as, a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment later, the car shot forward with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscious man supported between then.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he called to White, "Telephone them I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they raced through the level streets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">An Occasional Hero</seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg><seg type="columnLine">ihe Governor turned a puzzled look on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man resting against his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where did you get him?" he asked Far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley in a low voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And when Farley told him that the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come with a note from Calvin asking</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he be given work, the Governor made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no comment but his arm closed more pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tectingly around Cropsey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As usual, White did his work thoroughly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everything was in readiness to receive and</seg><seg type="columnLine">succor the stricken man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Governor waited until the surgeon</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made his report, pacing noiselessly up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down the long corridor of the men's</seg><seg type="columnLine">private ward, his head bent as if in thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And if the white-capped nurses, who flitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly in and out of the rooms, were sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised to see the highest representative of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States in all the East, awaiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">news of one of her lowliest citizens, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave no hint of it in their manner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR days Cropsey lingered in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">borderland which separates death</seg><seg type="columnLine">from life; and at first it seemed im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible that he should not pass across it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as is so often the case with those to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom life has the least value, he clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenaciously to it. In the second week it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came evident that he would get well, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he would have a long period of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">valescence in the hospital.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was during this period that the Gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernor dropped in to see him occasionally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making little friendly calls as a man does</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his equal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And during this period, a change seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come over Cropsey. It was as if the fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing through his system, had burned out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the resentment which hitherto he had felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward life. And with this change he real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized the enormity of his offense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Before, he had thought of the Governor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">General with a vague feeling of contempt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a man whom good luck had put into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">position which he, Cropsey, could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled much more ably had the same good</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck put him in it. Now he realized that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the Governor's strength and character</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had raised him above his fellows, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knowledge humbled him; he felt his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own unworthiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He spoke of it one afternoon, haltinglv</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he sat in a wheel-chair on the balcony</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside his room, overlooking the green ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">races studded with flowering shrubs which</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded the hospital, trying inadequate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly to find words to express his humiliation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Governor listened without interrup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion until Cropsey had finished. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">placing his hand on the patient's knee, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, whatever mistakes you made you</seg><seg type="columnLine">atoned for later. Suppose we call it quits</seg><seg type="columnLine">all around."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And on his wray out later, he stopped at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief surgeon's office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will Cropsey ever be good for anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">again?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "He will get over the effects of the fire all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, Governor,'' answered the surgeon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The trouble with him is he has shot his</seg><seg type="columnLine">constitution to pieces like so many of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows over here. I am treating him now</seg><seg type="columnLine">for chronic maiaria. That is what he will</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to watch out for, the fever. But with</seg><seg type="columnLine">light work and good food, in a place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he doesn't have to tax his strength too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much, he ought to last a long time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning Calvin was instructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep his eyes open for such a billet as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surgeon had described.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cropsey was able, with the aid of a cane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to w-alk about the hospital when Calvin re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported that he had found a place for him--</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper of the lighthouse at Bago reef.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Of course it is a place of great responsi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility, sir, for all the ships from Hongkong</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the north depend on that light," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secretary. "But he would have a na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive assistant to do the heavy work. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would only have to see that the light was</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept burning. Do you think you could</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Governor hesitated for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then said as if thinking aloud:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I believe we can. At any rate, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am going to chance it." A quizzical smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed over his face, and he added, "Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know, I have an idea White won't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">much pleased."	(</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have the same idea, sir," Calvin</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed. "I think you will have to settle</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with him yourself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a very important place, Governor,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said White quietly when the Governor men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned the matter to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I know', but I believe he will meas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure up to it. He has received his baptism</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fire, remember."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> White lifted his level eyes to the Govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">or's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course, if you say put him on, I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it, liut you will make me break one rule</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 have always observed--never to hire a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with a slouch in him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Governor drew meditatively at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Slouch or no slouch, the man did some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlung I confess I should not have had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage to do--run for that dynamite in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of away from it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But if he hadn't put it there in the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, he wouldn't have had to get it out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It took sand, I'll admit, but it was a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulse, a flash in the pan. If it came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">an emergency, like sticking to his post if</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything happened to the light--of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">I may be doing him an injustice --but hon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">estly I don't believe he would do it. I dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust these fellows who think they know it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ail and won't live up to the rules."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Governor rose and held out his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You put him on; I'll take the responsi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a part of White's code, once he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had employed Cropsey, to treat him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolute fairness. He might harbor a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grudge against him personally, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">judged his work as impartially as if the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldier had been his own selection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And for a time the new keeper's unfa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliarity with the routine of his office tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">White's patience. But he did not show it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the long, carefully worded letters he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrote Cropsey, minutely explaining the er-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rors in his reports and asking for their cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cropsey, on his sand spit, received these</seg><seg type="columnLine">letters, several at a time when the weekly</seg><seg type="columnLine">mail-boat put in at Bago, and a barefooted</seg><seg type="columnLine">boatman in cotton drawers and a wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straw hat paddled out to the lighthouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the mail. He spent hours poring over</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, try ing to fix each detail in his mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But secretly they amused him. All this list-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of tomatoes and bacon consumed, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallons of oil burned, of the hours he spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his work seemed so unnecessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thing was so simple, merely to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light burning from evening until morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, at all hazards, no matter what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened, so that the steamers whose smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">from time to time curled upward for half</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour against the distant horizon, might</seg><seg type="columnLine">shun the reef athwart, on which, for all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peacefulness of the blue water, lay destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion for any which might chance upon it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Cropsey was contented. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found his nichc; just to sit at the d&lt;x&gt;r of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow, sweeping the sea with his glasses</seg><seg type="columnLine">for passing ships and feeling that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">master ol the squat tower on his left, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so responsible for their safety, gave him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of iinj&gt;ortance and of usefulness in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world. He came to know the regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">boats and to speak of them to Fabian, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistant, affectionately, almost as il they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been persons; but he did not envy those</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them their journeyings. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that the jostling of the crowd meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">the multiplication of life's problems.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were no white people in Bago, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">village eight miles away at the head of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bay. Sometimes the villagers came over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lighthouse, and in solemn procession</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed the winding stair to the light, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they stood silent while Cropsey proudly ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained its mechanism. The presidente, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrinkled little man with an olive face, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore gaiters with elastic in their sides and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a suit of dingy' black clothes, always came</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them. He seemed to have taken a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great fancy to Cropsey, and always begged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to come to Bago and accept his hos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cropsey had been two months at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighthouse before he paid his fir.-t i-it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the village; but after that he went frequent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, dining with the presidente and return-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to his station before sunset. For on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">point his instructions had been explicit--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must always be at his post when the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">was burning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was this rule which led him to refuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">the invitation of the presidente to attend</seg><seg type="columnLine">the supper and bailc in honor of the presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dente's ninth child. The little man took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the refusal to heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it because I am a Filipino that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't come, senor?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, it is the light, senor presidente. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be here when it is burning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But from my house, from the bay, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can always see the light. And Fabian will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be here to watch it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anil when Cropsey still declined, the na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive's shoulders drooped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had hoped you would be padrino." he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will be padrino, even though I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">come," answered Cropsey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the man's disappointment troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as he returned to his house. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the native would never understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">why he declined to come; it would seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him almost a betrayal of his friendship. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">An Occasional Hero</seg><seg type="columnLine">37</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presidente had said, he would always</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in sight of the lighthouse; nothing could</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen in his absence. It was not as if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the typhoon season when his return</seg><seg type="columnLine">might, be cut off by a storm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning he decided he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">go. It would be the only time; he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the presidente understand that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he got into his boat that evening, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt vaguely depressed. He regretted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">decision. He glanced upward over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder at the light, which, with the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cise movements of a clock, was flashing its</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning through the gathering darkness;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and impulsively he crossed to the tower and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily climbed the stairs. Everything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order; it looked as he had seen it look a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand times before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a shamefaced laugh at his nervous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, he returned to his boat and set off for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he did not stay long at the christen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; his uneasiness came back. He was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient to be again with the light which, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he walked down to the water, lie saw flash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing across the bay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     THE full moon which had risen en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jgSg abled Cropsey to see his sand spit</seg><seg type="columnLine">long before he reached it; and sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly as he raised his eyes to glance again</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the lighthouse, he paused, his dripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddle held suspended in the air. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">protected waters back of the reef a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamer rode at anchor. For a time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not place the ship; none stopped at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that anchorage, except--then it came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The steamer was the lighthouse ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der Buluan, on which Inspector Morissey</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled. He had come while the keeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">was absent from his post.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Feverishly he returned to his paddling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ms gasps of effort drowning the gurgle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water as it fell away from the prow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his boat. One hope sustained him: per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps the inspector had not gone ashore that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. It was long past midnight; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamer might have just arrived</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as he neared his sand spit, he saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch drawn up on the shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He finished his journey slowly. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, was the end. He would lose his place!</seg><seg type="columnLine">branded as untrustworthy; and with this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    A u burned-°ut body, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not find another. No, he would drop into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that crowd of derelicts for whom even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem of making a Jiving had proved in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soluble, shuffling through what remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him of life an outcast and a p&gt;ariah. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Governor would learn that he had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trayed his trust; he only hoped that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never again be called on to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">those friendly gray eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked down at the water. A slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifting of position, a moment's struggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then oblivion. The ripples where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water broke over his hand on the paddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">were soft and its warmth pleasant to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin. It would close over him caress-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But something stirred in Cropsey, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling, some instinct, which had caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that other time to run for the dynamite.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a dogged sweep of his paddle, he drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">his batica ashore beside the launch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morissey was reading beside a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">wicker table, over which an unshaded lamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw a glaring light. He glanced up as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cropsey entered, but although he had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen the keeper before, he neither rose nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">introduced himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope you had a pleasant evening." he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, drawing the corners of his straight lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into a mocking smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cropsey's heart sank. He read no mercy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hard face before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> &lt;fYou're Inspector Morissey, I suppose, '</seg><seg type="columnLine">he replied, shuffling across the room to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair on the other side of the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. I hope my visit hasn't inconve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nienced you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My absence doesn't seem to have incon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venienced you much," flared back the keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er, stung by the other's insolence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your absence," returned Morissey im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perturbably. "I was coming to that. I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose you can explain it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cropsey's anger cooled as quickly as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had risen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There ain't no excuse, if you mean busy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness took me. I just went over for a min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute to a christening at the presidente's. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was padrino to his baby; he seemed to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was unfriendly when I said I wouldn't go.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everything was all right. It's a fine night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I could see the light even* minute I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Weil," said Morissey, rising and stretch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing himself with a yawn, "you'll have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to put it in writing in the morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'll give it to the chief. Maybe he can</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the connection between baptizing a baby</seg><seg type="columnLine">and running a lighthouse. I confess I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved over to the doorway, but on</seg><seg type="columnLine">its threshold be paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You might send a letter along to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Governor-General at the same time. 1 un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand he is a Iriend of yours." There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was open mockery in his tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cropsey sprang to his feet and rushed to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the inspector, his eyes blazing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You leave the Governor out of this. Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you hear? I ain't asking favors. 1 guess I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can take my medicine--you just leave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morissey stepped backward before this</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpected outburst. For a moment he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at Cropsey incredulously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you mean you are not going to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a whine to the Governor?" he asked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a changed tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. What's he got to do with it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without replying, Morissey paced two or</seg><seg type="columnLine">three times up and down the room, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands clasped behind him, his head bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">in thought. Now and then he shot a curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous look at Cropsey who was leaning against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door-jamb. his glance resting on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. At length he approached the keeper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Xook here," he said, "I shall have to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port your absence, but I wili tell White it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the first time--I talked with Fabian</seg><seg type="columnLine">before you came--and everything seems to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in capital shape. I will mention that, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You write out whatever you want to say.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Make it as strong as you can." Hie hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated as he saw the look in Cropsey's eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't count too much on it. White is</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong for keeping on the job. Maybe~he</seg><seg type="columnLine">will let you off this time, but frankly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt it. Good night!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cropsey limply shook the outstretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and without comment dragged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired body to the lighthouse. The staccato</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosions of the engine in Morissey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch sounded like pistol-shots in his brain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he sank wearily on the steps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO weeks later Morissey finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cruise and reported to White in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manila.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a queer specimen you have down</seg><seg type="columnLine">there," he said, as White looked up from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers in Cropsey's case. "He ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have whined, but he didn't; and when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">taunted him with his pull with the Gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernor, he nearly murdered me. If you fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, honestly, I don't believe he will put up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a howl."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> White laid the papers carefully on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table and swung his chair around, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the open window his glance rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the blue waters of the ba&gt; and the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant slope of Mariveles rising behind them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morissey's report had caused him a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinct feeling of regret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the months that Cropsey had been at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bago, White's feeling toward him had</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed. It had gradually been borne in</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him that the keeper was taking pride</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his work and was honestly trying to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his duties; and if a man is sincere in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, the work is apt to take care of itself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The irregularities in his reports had grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">less and less frequent. White had come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel that Bago was no longer one of his prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lems. To dismiss Cropsey would be- to open</seg><seg type="columnLine">it again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the invariable punishment for ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sence from duty was dismissal. He told</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself he would have to let the keeper go,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he also told himself there was no hurry</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the matter could rest until tomorrow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned briskly and rose from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on," he said, "let's go up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">club and have a bile of lunch. There are-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or two points I want to clear up before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I take action.-'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I don't think he would do it again.'' said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inspector, stretching himself lazily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I suppose we will have to let him</seg><seg type="columnLine">out," White answered indifferently, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">started for the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morissey smiled, but made no comment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The papers were still hang on White's</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk when the* inspector entered the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know," said the chief, "1 have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been trying to find a man for that Bago</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, and to save my soul I can't think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one I would be willing to trust with it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Confound that fellow! He has put us in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not let Cropsey stay on for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time?" ventured Morissey, turning to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window to conceal his grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> White tapped the edge of his desk with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pencil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But that--" The strident noise of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephone-bell interrupted him. "Yes, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is White!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morissey, watching the face of his chief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew from its growing tenseness that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">receiving news of importance. He caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words, "Bago--Cropsey--cholera, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say! Yes, I'll go at once! Thank you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">An Occasional Hero</seg><seg type="columnLine">39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  White snapped the receiver on its hook</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sprang to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Can the Buluan put to sea in an hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, something the matter with Crop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sey?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I don't know. That was the Executive</seg><seg type="columnLine">Secretary. He had a wire from the presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dente at Bago. Said they have had cholera</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the lighthouse, and Cropsey needs help.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The message wasn't very dear. I'll get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor and meet you on board at noon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The one thing which unfailingly strikes</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror to the heart of the white man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philippines is Asiatic cholera. Its loath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">someness, the suddenness with which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">strikes its victims, the flame-like rapidity</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which it spreads, give it an air of mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teriousness which adds to its horror. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">he eats, the very air he breathes seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged with a subtle menace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     WHEN Cropsey, ten days after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morissey's departure, entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nipa house on the other side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower, in which Fabian lived with his wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">and two children, he had expected to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them ailing of a mild complaint. Fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bian had said merely that the nino was sick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he requested Cropsey to come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But a glance at the gasping child and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cropsey had recognized the malady of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had seen strong men die over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. It had cholera.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The mother, round-eyed and passive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatted on the floor behind the low bed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind her, beside a half-emptied rice-pot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood the other child, its little stomach pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truding like an inflated balloon from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">short white shirt. It had eaten from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same vessel as its brother. Fabian enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing after Cropsey, had paused near the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The eyes of all were fixed on the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. In their trouble they had instinctively</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to him for assistance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Cropsey gave some hurried instructions</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the woman--in his heart he realized their</seg><seg type="columnLine">inadequacy--and then, turning away, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">beckoned to Fabian, who followed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the sand spit to his bungalow. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cropsey wrote a hurried letter to White</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling him of the cholera and suggesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he send a man to Bago to take charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the light, in case his services should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">hC S5id t0 Fabian&gt; "you take</seg><seg type="columnLine">this lo Bago and post it. Then you come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back with Gonzales, the mcdico, quick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But be sure to post the letter--there's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat tomorrow. And ask the presidente to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come back with you; he can send a man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taypay with a telegram."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The resentfulness, which since Morissey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit Cropsey's face had worn, was gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the depths of his eyes one might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen a vague look of terror; but his step, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he again entered Fabian's house, was reso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fabian reached Bago as night was falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">--in the bottom of the banca which a fish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-boat had picked up as it drifted aim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly about the bay; and Cropsey's letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the pocket of his camisa when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried him the next morning, without wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for the presidente to return from a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">days' visit to Taypay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At about the same hour Cropsey and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman were spading two narrow graves in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sand back of the lighthouse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through his glasses later he watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mail-boat depart for Manila. In a week,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told himself, she would return with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to relieve him, and he could get away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would not wait for his dismissal. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was weary. He stretched his hand against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a post to support himself, as a slight dizzi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness shook him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was alone when the mail-boat re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned. He had difficulty in making out</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lines. His sight was becoming blurred;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had to blink before he looked at objects.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three days and nights he had watched be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the woman, stealing away only to at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tend the light, and to snatch such food as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could find fit to eat without cooking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then--of her house he had made her</seg><seg type="columnLine">funeral pyre.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the woman gone, his duties had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become less exacting; but he found them</seg><seg type="columnLine">more difficult to perform. The walk be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween his bungalow and the tower became</seg><seg type="columnLine">a journey, which at last he ceased to make/</seg><seg type="columnLine">living in the lighthouse and saving his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength for the torturing climb of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had long since ceased to wonder why</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fabian had not come back with the presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dente. Only one idea filled his mind--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the light burning until the white ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming from the south turned in at Bago</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now that white ship was here. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched her cut her way leisurely through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue-gray waters to the distant village;</seg><seg type="columnLine">40</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then for hours he waited for the bout</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would bring liis relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When ut lust he realized that none was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming, he gave a mirthless laugh and sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in the doorway of the tower, his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting on its sill. They expected him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do the job alone; they refused to help him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here the presidente found him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make little of Cropsey's mutterings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shook his head when he saw the burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. There was an air of desolation about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took the keeper by the arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come with me, sefior," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Cropsey shook him olT with feeble</seg><seg type="columnLine">curses, raving incoherently something about</seg><seg type="columnLine">"being no quitter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the Butuan, under forced draft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded the point to the south, the sun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining brightly; and White and Morissey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing on the bridge, eagerly focussed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their glasses on the lighthouse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently an exclamation broke from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morissey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"My God! The light's flashing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The presidente met them on the beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The door is locked, sefior," he said, "and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all day yesterday the light burned."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">White forced the door and ran hurriedly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up the stairs; but something by the light</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drove him back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As he passed to the fresh air outside, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">met the doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I don't think you will be needed," he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Two hundred yards out across the rip-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pling water, the iButuan rode at anchor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">From her stem, snapping in the brisk</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">breeze, flew the flag of his country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">For a full minute White gazed at it fixed-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ly. Then, turning, he raised his glance to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the light; and suddenly lifting his hat, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">placed it against his breast, and bowed his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">head reverently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">HAPyD ROCK</seg><seg type="columnLine">Juliuj*</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grinnell</seg><seg type="columnLine">Furtfimann</seg><seg type="columnLine">T WAS at Sixtv-Mile, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the Mojave, where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains met the desert; where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grant Brothers &amp; McCann were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushing a hard-rock grade toward Reno for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the California &amp; Nevada Southwestern;</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the sun was dropping down behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">H</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hills, and the light it cast becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">softened and romantic; where, of a sudden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great peaks shook.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boom!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was no wind; only this low, sullen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">roar came back over the hills.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boom-mt</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hard Rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">41</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were firing the evening round.

It was as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">several batteries of big guns had suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone into action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the deathly quiet that fell with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last of it, two men slowly mounted the rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">path that chipped its way up the steep w'all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the canon leading into the far side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp. They were an oddly assorted pair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One was a squat, burly little man in cordu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roys, with a chest like a gorilla, extraordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">narily long arms and a pug nose.

Plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of daylight lingered; the purple mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned against the vermillion sky; and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue, an immense height above, lolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">an eagle, lazy of wing, in lordly indolence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crowd stood twenty deep; a typical</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard-rock crew--tall, barbaric-looking men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in khaki and corduroy, careless of speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gay at heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Gunner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go in, Bonfire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I saw the Shoshone scrap."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They fought two hours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     THE two men were well matched.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One was as tall as the other, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad; and it would have been hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say, if there was any advantage in weight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just where it fell. The two men sparred</seg><seg type="columnLine">warily, moving after each other with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet ease of two huge cats. There is a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain beauty in strength, and then there is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain ugliness; but that usually comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">with age. These two men were beautifully</seg><seg type="columnLine">young and strong, and their lithe white</seg><seg type="columnLine">nakedness gleamed in the twilight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Time!" roared the men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No hurry," muttered Bonfire, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped in a light lead. It was a flashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">dart of wrist and mitt, and the Gunner's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lip streamed red as he recovered with a rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a shower of sledge-hammer blows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First blood set the crowd to yelling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bonfire ducked gamely. He had all he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do to save his head. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">evading that avalanche of big-bodied bone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and muscle. He stood his ground and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave smash for smash, though the play</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not up to his fancy; for the Gunn- r's</seg><seg type="columnLine">long game was to give and take. Bonfire's</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hit and get away; but there was no help</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it now. He caught Gallegher in lull</seg><seg type="columnLine">dash, and, playing for the body, drove home</seg><seg type="columnLine">his left and right with a force that jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth a grunt with each blow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gallegher halted, grinning for more; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bonfire stepped into a full swing that gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a taste of his own salt blood; he sab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">red, and the rue. For another savage swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat down his guard, and as he dived in for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hanging clinch to save himself, his jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">came full on the peak of a sidelong uppercut</seg><seg type="columnLine">which started at the Gunner's right hip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big fist traveling less than six inches, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder nine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a terrific bunt. Bonfire found him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self on his knees watching a gay fanfare of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning crazily filming his brain. Blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">trickled from liis nose and ears. He saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunner dragging himself on all fours out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hurly-burly of the yelling mob. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body-English of the blow had carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">him headlong over his man. Then, reeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their feet, the two men went at it again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back and forth they footed it, struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">for holds. Twice Bonfire tore loose and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggering the Gunner with a straight right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left, he clinched again. To and fro</seg><seg type="columnLine">they clipped once more, with the crowd roar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for a break; but the two men paid no</seg><seg type="columnLine">heed, and in the wrestling Gallegher began</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hard Rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show who was the stronger man. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again he beat Bonfire to his knees, using</seg><seg type="columnLine">ihe sheer weight of body and fist. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible punishment; yet there must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been something of the Antaeus in the man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for with each fall Bonfire seemed to gain</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh wind and new heart for the fray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He began to come back to something like</seg><seg type="columnLine">his old snap-shot form. He began to fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his head and feet as well as his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Up to now he had given way and been</seg><seg type="columnLine">clubbed down. The Gunner still rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him fiercely, wildly; but now Bonfire moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a wind-driven shadow, hitting hard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast at ever}' turn. He gave his adversary</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect withal, cutting and slashing at long</seg><seg type="columnLine">range, until the rushes began to fall short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow more unsteady, more wild, which must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be expected if you don't get your man; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, taking his time, Bonfire began to cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Gunner to pieces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus the tide turned, and at last Galle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gher halted, blinded, gasping. He spat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tooth lay on the ground. He stood still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowering like a stricken bull; his breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in great sobs; blow by blow, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being worn down to the quick; then, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">verge of his stubborn relapse, surprisingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if drawing on the last ounce of his reserve</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy, the Gunner made a snarling rush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slugging out with both fists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bonfire side-stepped neatly, parading</seg><seg type="columnLine">some pretty foot-work. He ducked under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">full right-swing, and driving left and right</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ribs, got away. Gallegher reeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the savage impact, but turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back gamely; he rocked a little as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood opposite his man, and his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">drooped as if he felt his fists to be an unut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terable weight. His face showed terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">punishment. Every breath he drew seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great actuality. The man was smashed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all in at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> finish him!'' bellowed the crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the beginning of the end, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mob was not to be denied. Bonfire smiled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes were quiet, even pensive; but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was terrible livid with the strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost unearthly russet pallor that follows</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stormy pageant of red-headed men like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curse of God. A sudden hush fell on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd, which had drawn back a little, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two men in the middle might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty room to make an end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bonfire took his time. The Gunner</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked all in, and all that; but Bonfire knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">his man. He had beaten him before, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had him beaten now; but Bonfire was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to take any chances. Hard rock is</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard rock. You may pierce it with sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel and break it with dynamite, but you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't kill it. It is smashed; at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it lives, ready to strike back. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are men like that. They work in hard rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bonfire made no mistake. He crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the motionless figure in the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ring; he stalked it deliberately, coolly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidently, like a big cat waiting for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment to spring. One punch, just one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was all he wanted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he sprang in. Whatever was</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing in the Gunner's mind at this mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment is not knowm, but he seemed barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to raise his hands to meet the other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush. He attempted a right swing, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bonfire dropped his guard to sweep aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then something happened which can not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be explained. For, with his foeman once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more within easy reach, weariness seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fall from Gallegher's shoulders like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket; he grinned with awful expression,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the rest was sharp work, grim and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift and terrible. His right swing was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feint; now he sank it like a flash, and as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed through with a quick, curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifting of his feet, his left fist shot in over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bonfire's lowered guard. It struck di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly over the heart--a two hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten pound jolt--and Bonfire straightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">up slowly, then fell forward like a stricken</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree, face dowrn in the soft white dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wras the end. Gallegher knew it; so</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the crowd, by its silence. It was a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute perhaps before the prostrate figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred; then, surprisingly, the man rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over on his back and sat up, raising himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly upon his outspread arms. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around stupidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gallegher broke the silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Had enough?" he asked, standing over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his man; Bonfire looked up, wetting hi.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he said in a minute. "No, I ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">done yet!" And he tried to get up on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fell back on one knee, and then sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly made it after a fashion, rocking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying in front of the Gunner like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunken man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good boy," said somebody in the crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bonfire staggered out and around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunner. He tried to lift his hands, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> *'Come on," he said thickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Gallegher hesitated no longer. He ad-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vanced a step, his list rising at his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Another blow would finish it; but the Gun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ner paused in full stride, his arm poising in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mid-swing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"WAIT a minute!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A burly figure barred his way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It all happened in the tick of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clock. The newcomer held up his hand. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was a powerful, wide-girthed fellow with a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heavy, brutal face and a scowling brow,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which, as his grin faded, matched a hard-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">set mouth. A respectful commotion rose</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What's the matter with you boys?" he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">growled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Bonfire reeled weakly at his elbow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Get out of my way!" roared the Gunner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The other laughed in his face. Pie spoke</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with authority.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a minute, there. What d'you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">want to do--kill the man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Gallegher breathed in once, hard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I would," he said, and once more Bon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fire staggered out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Come on, Gunner," he begged. "I ain't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">done yet-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The newcomer shouldered him off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There won't be any more scrapping to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">night," he said, as if that settled it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A low murmur bespoke the displeasure of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As for the Gunner, he drew a whistling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">breath and batted an eye at Bonfire, and a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strange thing happened. Both men turned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and made for the other man, their arms</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swinging loose, murderously, like those in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">common cause. The other stood his ground;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he laughed, and at the sound Bonfire</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stopped and shook himself dazedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Wait a second," he said, catching the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gunner's arm, "it's Jeff Call, the Walker!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You're a fine rock foreman!" sneered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the walking-boss. "You're a fine guy, you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are! Who's going to hole South Thirty-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Five if you get put out?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The question had at once the physical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">effect of oil and a barb. There was a low</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">murmur of assent from the crowd. Bonfire</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">winced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What arc y'ou butting in for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The walking-boss met the parry with a'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">curse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What am I butting in for? Well, you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">can bet all your old shoes it wasn't because</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I was worrying about your hide! I'll tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you why--I ain't taking any chances. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Thirty-Five is holed tomorrow ii</seg><seg type="columnLine">means a two thousand dollar bonus for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp. Ain t that what we been working</seg><seg type="columnLine">for day and night for the last month?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd was impressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's so," muttered a few.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The walking-boss saw his advantage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursued it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, boys. See if I ain't right!</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Thirty-Five is in three thousand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">four feet. The engineers told me this morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that the work in North Thirty-Five--</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other side of the hill--was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-six foot away. Our grade and</seg><seg type="columnLine">theirs is the like, and I've stopped their</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the work. Too dangerous. The day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot broke an even nine foot in the tunnel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 figure on the night shift doing the same,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so with a little luck, Bonfire ought to hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">her out tomorrow and grab the bonus!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bonfire smiled a wan smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I'll hole her all right," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">proudly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly the walking-boss clinched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">argument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then what's the use of taking any</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances? Bonfire knows the old girl like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a book. If he gets licked today the Gunner</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets his job. He may be a good man--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know he is--but we've got to think about</seg><seg type="columnLine">our bonus. If they want to fight it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">again let them wait till the shift comes off</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow afternoon. It's all the same lo</seg><seg type="columnLine">me then; what I'm thinking about is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonus. The camp wants the money and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the record. The Gunner can take a ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine under Bonfire if he likes and share</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the rest. WTiat d'you say?''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd was with him to a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fair enough," said Bonfire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Gunner gave a short- nod.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But say, Jeff Call," he addressed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking-boss, "since you're such a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand at fixing things, maybe you'd like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">try a little of the same?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What d'you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know what I mean--when Bonfire</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I get through. Winner take all," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Gunner, looking sly, "bunk, and bindle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and job."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of the men laughed. The walking-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss gave a surprised curse, then scowled</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know, Gunner. I'll have to see.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You and Bonfire better go and have a wash</seg><seg type="columnLine">before supper. I like your nerve; I may give</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hard Rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg><seg type="columnLine">you a chance if you put Bonfire away. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't had a good scrap since that set-to with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red Cobleigh up on the North Bank--</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly two years ago. I'll see, Gunner; I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">see about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '"No hurry, Jeff," said the Gunner, look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at his knuckles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bonfire touched his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, Gunner," he said. "Let's go</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wash up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Late that night the shift struck springs</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the heading, so when Bonfire and the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">shift came on the next morning the delayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot was just being pulled. The denota-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions cracked forth from the portal of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel with a certain deliberation, as from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mouth of a big gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men of the night shift looked hag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gard and wan from their long vigil at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines.</seg><seg type="columnLine">gfflJS BONFIRE saw that the air-pumps</seg><seg type="columnLine">IhmJ were set to wrork, then entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel. The Gunner followed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a w^ord. Each carried a flaring stub</seg><seg type="columnLine">of candle. Halfway in, creeping foot-high</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the narrow muck-car track, an acrid</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow smoke met them; the ghost of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast. They pressed on, coughing as this</seg><seg type="columnLine">sub-floor of gas and smoke grew thick, wall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like, reducing the yellow flame of the can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dles to mere spots in the murk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the heading, however, they found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air clean and sweet, made so by the suck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drive of the two great tin air-pipes</seg><seg type="columnLine">which hung against the left wall of the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">drift. It sounded like a giant coughing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gagging.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A huge pile of broken stone, the product</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the shot, confronted them, and back of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming, sheer, blank, rose the clean white</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast of living rock. The two rockmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched on the towering pile, inspecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grim work of steel, giant powder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine white muck," said Bonfire, sifting</seg><seg type="columnLine">some. "Clean and dry as a wisp. No more</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, glory be!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> L hen the men came in. Bonfire told</seg><seg type="columnLine">them that a scant nine feet of white lime-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone lay between them and the big bonus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He drove the shovelers at the great pile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken rock. They caught something of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own virile impatience. By and by, hauled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the little electric motor-engine, car after</seg><seg type="columnLine">car of muck shot out to the dump. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Gunner condescended to put a hand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shovel and speedily cleared a place against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breast of rock to set his big air-drill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a muck-car loaded with sharp steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">drills rolled into the heading. The nipper</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy stood them in the rack and presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">the narrow drift was filled with the brazen</seg><seg type="columnLine">song and scream of steel biting into hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Candles stuck in broken ledges of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage threw an unearthly yellow glare</seg><seg type="columnLine">over all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The drills were changed every three min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes. Within two hours the muck pile was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slender heap. Bonfire stood at the naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">backs of his men, contentedly drinking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the din. The Gunner worked like a demon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He arrayed himself with steel and air which</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed and hissed and sang against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly face of the stubborn rock. Bonfire</seg><seg type="columnLine">patted his streaming shoulder approvingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Gunner was setting a terrific pace for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of the men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't wear yourself out, Gunner," ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vised Bonfire, with a grin. "Remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've got a little unfinished business for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this afternoon.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm remembering," returned the Gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner grimly. He grinned, but there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen, half-cruel look about the tight lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">and impatient eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At three o'clock the roimd was set down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and load *d. It consisted of fourteen holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaded with about three or four hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds of dynamite. Each hole was capped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a primer and a fuse. Ten of the holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were three inches in diameter and eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet deep in the rock. The four remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes were four inches in diameter and sis</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet deep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These last four were bored diagonally into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rock about two feet above the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They required almost as heavy a load as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of the holes combined; they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">called the lifters. The fuses of these loads</seg><seg type="columnLine">were cut and timed so as to fire last, tha/</seg><seg type="columnLine">each great shot might have a separate op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity to heave up through its quarter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rock, rending and tearing all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is the lifter that smashes hard rock into</seg><seg type="columnLine">small fine bits. So, on occasion, would it</seg><seg type="columnLine">smash a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men stood back a little as Bonfire</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Gunner made ready to fire the</seg><seg type="columnLine">round. Black lengths of fuse dangled over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white face of the rock like the tenacles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a huge devil-fish. The four top-holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fired first; they ranged across the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">46</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the breast, about two feet from the roof.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lirst fuse, which was cut at nine feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spat a wicked stream of lire over the Gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner's candle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly a curious commotion appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the men. They began a hoarse cry--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fire in the heading!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It passed quickly from mouth to mouth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and echoed out and through the far, glim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mering portal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each foot of fuse represented sixty sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onds of time. When Bonfire and the Gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner set fire to the six breast-holes which lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the middle of the rock, the first fuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the top-hole measured less than six feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spat tire and hissed like an angry snake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lifters were fired last. Then, candle in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, Bonfire drove his men toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor-engine waiting in the heading to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry- them all to safety. Gallegher walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men clumsily piled into the depths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">three empty muck-cars coupled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor-engine, while Bonfire and the Gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner climbed up on opposite sides of a fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">car, which was nearly full of broken rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound for the dump.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All aboard," said Bonfire, and the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">train started with a jerk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, as they got under way, the Gunner</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned over his side of the car and said--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Bonfire, if-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He never finished the sentence. For,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as he spoke, the loaded muck-car</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeled under them and gave a sudden lurch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bonfire sprang backwards to see the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">heel and crash into the ditch on the Gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner's side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     THE Gunner himself disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      The motor-engine leapt ahead, car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ rying three cars and a snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">coupling. It stopped within five lengths,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some of the men came running back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The muck-car lay on its side in the ditch;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Gunner, who had been pinned under</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in some way, cried out suffocatedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another cry answered him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fire in the heading!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">And a small band of Mexican shovelers</seg><seg type="columnLine">piled out of the cars and ran helter-skelter</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the portal. Bonfire stood gazing dow-n</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the wrecked car, his men behind him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Howr are you fixed, Gunnerl" he shouted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The buried man's voice came back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine, lad. Kind of short of breath, ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count of this load of muck on my chest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But outside of that I guess I'm all together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You lads better go while you can-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For answer Bonfire sprang into the ditch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tugged at the high side of the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned muck-car with a futile, frantic grip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His torso muscles leashed and creaked un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the unequal strain. His men went at</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, too, on all sides of the car, but to no good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was too much for them, and presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">they all stood back gasping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fire in the heading!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cry rang back from the narrow walls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A few of the men glanced at the blazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuses in the heading and ran. The motor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man asked Bonfire for orders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No hurry," said Bonfire coolly. "At</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, I guess we ain't got time to unload this</seg><seg type="columnLine">muck car."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The slender band of men who remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast furtive looks in the direction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparking and hissing rock. A few whim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered for Bonfire to come on. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook them off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on with you," urged the buried man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There ain't no use of you fellows sticking</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. I'm just as good as dead. Go on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bonfire, or the first thing you know she'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be licking all of you out along with me--</seg><seg type="columnLine">d'you hear? Bonfire--Bonfire, lad--you</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't gone yet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Bonfire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men had shrunk back a little and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him standing there. Nothing seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No hurry," he muttered, glancing at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of iron rod he held in his right hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was about tw'o feet long and spoon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped at one end; a miner's spoon, an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plement used by rockmen for removing</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuse and primer from a hole when a misfire</seg><seg type="columnLine">or something is the matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, Bonfire," begged the men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It won't do any good to stand here. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard what the Gunner said. Look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning drift!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bonfire trimmed a stub of candle with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fire in the heading!" shrilled the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lentless cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It fell to a piteous screech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on, then!" Bonfire roared of a sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den and the men fell back before the cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire that was in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you going to do?" muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing," said Bonfire. "I'm going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay and pull that load."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hard Rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">47</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He swung around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aw, say, Bonfire," growled the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the muck car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fire in the heading!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The motor-engine roared out toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">portal as Bonfire turned and ran back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sparking breast. A deathly quiet fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the narrow drift. The dark was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">doom. It was accentuated rather than dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed by that ominous hiss and flash.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bonfire and the Gunner were alone with . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fire in the heading!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the portal the men of the day shift</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited in characteristic attitudes. Many</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed. They named the powder and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock horribly*. Others rolled cigarettes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Mexicans shrilled prayers for the dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">until Burns, the little timberman, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a few words of the gibberish and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fusillade of sharp rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ain't you a fine bunch of grave diggers!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he roared. "Get out of this!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of the men jumped up and ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward camp, screaming the news along</seg><seg type="columnLine">road and path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fire in the heading!" moaned the siren</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the hill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He can't make it," muttered Burns.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's got less than four minutes to pull the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole load. There ain't a chance in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world for him to get down to those bloody</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifters. And one of them, mind, will fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole round!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, suddenly, there came a short, whip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like roar close at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One," counted the men mechanically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BONFIRE'S first act on entering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drift had been to reach for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sputtering length of fuse which dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled from the top hole at the left. This fuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been fired first. He pulled lightly. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">shower of fine sand and a yellow stick of</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant powder slid into his hand. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">gnashed at the spark in the fuse with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife. It flamed within three feet and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half from the primer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three and one-half minutes of life!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bonfire worked swiftly with knife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, guttering fuse and primer. For light</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that dark and narrow plac^ he clenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four-inch stub of candle between his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong white teeth. When he reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four breast-holes, the first fuse read like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One minute and thirty seconds!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bonfire began to curse the living rock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And each red eye in that rugged face seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to twinkle back with infinite mirth. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">winked at him in a huge grin. Bonfire</seg><seg type="columnLine">whimpered as he stabbed at the terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Great rivulets of sweat ran down his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks. He could feel the hot stream drip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping on his breast, welling under his arm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His curses broke out afresh. He personi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied everything. He had a profane name</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the rock, for the powder, for the Gunner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the men who waited at the portal. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">very rock seemed possessed. It clutched</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clung to the imp of death in its]vitals like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mother to her child. When a primer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fuse came readily to his hand he cursed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">endearingly; and when it evaded him almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunningly, he bellowed like an angry bull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mechanically, his motions were perfect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no faltering, no trick of the hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">or eye wasted, and no wavering of heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man appeared to array himself against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grim breast of the rock with superb ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">frontry. Now he laughed and sang at in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tervals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the first lifter! Less than a foot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuse lay between his knife and the primer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fie chuckled. Less than sixty seconds to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death! He tore at the second lifter-hole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the fuse, brittle and rotten with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying spark, came away in his scorched and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleeding hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an awful jiffy' of terror he was minded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tear at the stubborn rock with his bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitts. He dug furiously in the lifter-hole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching for the hidden primer with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miner's spoon. He nicked the spark without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glance. There was no time. The third</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifter rose easily, and Bonfire laughed. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife touched the brass primer on one side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the spark on the other. Less than fif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen ticks of the clock between him and . . \</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One hole remained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He squatted on die floor, driving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoon warily against the wall of the hole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the lightest touch would drop that hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">spark into the primer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bonfire felt the spoon catch hold. A cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat broke and welled all over him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised the spoon carefully, so that its pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious burden might not joggle, and then, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he nipped the protruding yellow stick with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its stub of fuse, he knew that he held Death</seg><seg type="columnLine">spitting in his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned and threw it toward the portal</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all his might. It hurtled through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air and fell a good fifty' feet beyond where</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Gunner lay under the overturned muck-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Then he crumpled against the side of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> rock, which received him on its huge white</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> breast almost gently. He wondered at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sullen roar and the shock of air which flat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tened him out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   And when the men came upon him, a lit-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tle later, he was lying face-down in a little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> pile of primers and fuse beside the stingless</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> breast of rock. He breathed jerkily. With</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> gentle hands they turned him over on his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> back. He seemed to grin at them, and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> grotesque effect was heightened by a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> twisted stub of candle jauntily coked in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> comer of his mouth like a cherished per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fecto.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   ''Awfully tired," he said suddenly. Then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> he wandered a little. "That you, Gunner?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No hurry; I'll be ready for you in a minute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Give me a smoke, somebody," he added,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sitting up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   As they half carried him past the Mexi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> cans shoveling muck from the car which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> still pinned the Gunner in the ditch, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> stood free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Hello, Gunner?" he called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "That you, Bonfire?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "How d'you feel?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Pretty good. How's yourself?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Oh, I'm all right. Have you got any-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> thing broke, Gunner?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No; I don't think so." The buried man</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to hesitate. "Say, lad," he began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "That was a grand piece of work you just</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> put over. I'd liked to have done it my-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> self."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Oh, you would, eh?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You heard me. And say, let me tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">something, feUow. You wait till they get</seg><seg type="columnLine">this load of muck off my chest. Then you</seg><seg type="columnLine">look out for yourself!" The muffled voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">- broke off. Then, "D'you hear?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Bonfire laughed a hard, soundless laugh</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> through closed lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Oh, I'll wait for you," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was all. Bonfire laughed again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started back into the heading to look over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reloading of the day shot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hard rock is hard rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     TWO days later an empty chuck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed wagon returned to Sixty-Milt Sid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.

Every boarding-house</seg><seg type="columnLine">on South and Water Streets was crammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with seafarers ready to sign away their liber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty for a year without remuneration as long</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they could till a gnawing stomach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among this crowd of destitutes, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the fortunate ones, having been</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken in by Dennis Sullivan after spending</seg><seg type="columnLine">a week or two "living in the street and</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarding in the market." Sullivan, fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliarly known to sailormen as "Hash"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sullivan, ran a boarding-house on Oliver</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street, and a worse "sailor-robber" never</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew breath. He was Irish and a "plug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly" for looks, and his cognomen came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the form of diet which was the piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">de resistance at his establishment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN I blew into Hash Sullivan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">my whole worldly possessions con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted of my clothes and a slieath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife. The clothes, for convenience and</seg><seg type="columnLine">decency's sake, I carried on my back; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">consisted of an old felt "bucko" hat, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woolen shirt, a pair of tar-stained dungaree</seg><seg type="columnLine">pants, and a pair of "slipshods"--sea-boots</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the uppers cut off. Socks I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have. The knife and sheath were sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported around my waist by a strap which</seg><seg type="columnLine">originally formed part of a horse's harness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but when Sullivan saw it, he promptly took</seg><seg type="columnLine">it away from me, saying:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Young fellow, I wouldn't wear that belt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is nawthin' looks so well on a sailor</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a good smart rope-yarn."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So my clothes and knife were afterwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">held together and supported by a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">marline, and my belt went to fit out some</seg><seg type="columnLine">ether poor devil outward bound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I lived a good three or four weeks at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sullivan's, and during the whole of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I scoured the docks looking for a ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Masters and mates I interviewed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">score. Some civilly declined my services,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while others, tired of being importuned by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hosts of desperate sailormen thronging</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wharves, kicked me off their decks with</seg><seg type="columnLine">curses and bitter oaths. It was a miserable</seg><seg type="columnLine">lime; cold receptions and cold weather for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half'dad man, and I think il I had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained ashore any longer than I did, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have thrown myself off the dock and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended my misery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I considered myself unusually fortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the master of au English ship bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Australia came along to the boarding-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house and picked me out to make up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew. Though I was a qualified navigator</seg><seg type="columnLine">and holding a "lime-juice" ticket for com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petency as master mariner, 1 was only too</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to stick my fist on the articles of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship Magician as an able seamen at twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five dollars a month and two months' ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance. My fifty dollars was to be paid after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship had sailed, and Mr. Sullivan took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the note "in payment for board, lodging</seg><seg type="columnLine">and outfit," giving me a dollar to "blow"</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself with before I went aboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dollar provided a few schooners of</seg><seg type="columnLine">beer for my less fortunate companions at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boarding-house, and with a dirty' canvas</seg><seg type="columnLine">bag containing my outfit--a sackful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">straw known as a "donkey's breakfast,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt and pants made of "dog's wool and</seg><seg type="columnLine">oakum," a nondescript blanket and a pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of second-hand sea-boots--I, with the oth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, was escorted aboard the ship by Sulli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">van's roughneck runners and taken in hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the mate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A towboat hauled us down the harbor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the Bay.

The grub was "lime-</seg><seg type="columnLine">juicer style"--not much of a variety, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was of good qaulity and the bread barge</seg><seg type="columnLine">was always filled without question. Plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of biscuit meant plenty of those favorite</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea dishes, cracker hash and dandyfunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The voyage also would be a lengthy one--</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York to Melbourne, via the Cape, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Melbourne to England by way of the Horn</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and though I was serving in a subordinate</seg><seg type="columnLine">capacity, yet I was glad to do it and happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the thought that I had shelter and food</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a year at least.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With a roaring westerly blowing over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter, we stood away to the east'ard on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old deepwaterman's track to pick up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the northeast trades for a shoot across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Line, and I can remember, after my trick</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the wheel, how delighted I was with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship's running qualities and the easy man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner in which she steered. This is quite an</seg><seg type="columnLine">important thing on an Australian voyage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where over four thousand miles of easting is</seg><seg type="columnLine">run with square yards and a heavy sea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sailors have no use for a vessel that is likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prove a "terror" when running the east-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We dropped the land astern that morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During the day the wind held strong and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailed "at the rate of knots" with a main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skysail set. Towards nightfall the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauled southerly with fog. When I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">on watch at four next morning, the ship was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitching and rolling in a lumpish sea, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">fog shrouded everything. The wind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming away squally, and when our star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowlines mustered aft, the second mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed the word, "In royals and flying jib!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We manned the royal gear and clewed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sails, and while some of the watch went</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloft to furl, I and two others went for'ard</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the fo c s le head to tackle the flying jib.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fog was very thick--so thick that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible to sec the flying jibboom from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cathead. I can remember, after we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">slacked away on the halyards and manned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the downhaul, the second mate coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">for ard and singing out to the three of us:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Come.aft here, some of you, when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">git that jib down.

"I can muzzle that</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket handkerchief all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And while they made their way aft, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">clambered over the bows and out to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flying jib was bellying and slatting</seg><seg type="columnLine">around in the breeze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We carried one of those old-fashioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky-raking bowsprits protruding very far</seg><seg type="columnLine">out over the water, and by the time I</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the flying jibboom footropes, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel was blotted out in the thickness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vapor, while the horn came through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the veil in a pitifully feeble drone. As I lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened to the roar of the bow wave beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the scarce-heard wail of the horn, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the dim halo of our lights, I thought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be just the kind of morning for a bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">collision. The notion made me shiver and</seg><seg type="columnLine">look around apprehensively, but the slatting</seg><seg type="columnLine">jib gave me little time for thoughts of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature. Clambering up the stay I was busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly engaged in stamping the hanks down</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my sea-booted feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Humming a little song to myself, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing the stops, when the wail of a fog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">horn came to my ears. I listened intently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking at first that it was our own. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused in my W'ork, with nerv es astrain. a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of misty whiteness came sweeping out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the murk on our starboard. While I</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled in excited fright, the luminous bulk</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the shape of the headsails and double</seg><seg type="columnLine">topsails of a large ship crossing our bows!</seg><seg type="columnLine">THINGS happened with frightful</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenness. While I hung to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled-up canvas of the flying jib</seg><seg type="columnLine">with skin tingling and hair raised in alarm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other vessel stormed past and I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was going clear until I saw myself look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down over her deck and felt the tip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boom strike the stranger's mizzen rig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging. As soon as I felt the shock. I jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and landed with a thump into the bottom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quarter-boat outslungon davits, and while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was picking myself up there was a crash,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a volley of shouts and curses, and then both</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessels must have gone clear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My legs seemed paralyzed, and I fancied</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment that I had broken my back</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I struck the thwarts of the boat. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a few' seconds the numbness departed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and 1 became conscious of a hoarse voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fetch a lantern here, some o' you! That</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasted Dutchman has stove th' whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter in--Th' bloody bumpkin's gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Braces adrift. Look alive!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A lantern was brought, casting a halo of</seg><seg type="columnLine">5~</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow in the mist, and a voice came booming:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How's that boat? Is she stove?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thought I hard somethin' failin' into it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Look an' see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I was fully conscious of everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was happening below me, but I made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no attempt to rise out of the boat. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know why. Probably I had not recovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shock. Anyway, I lay across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thwart until a man's head appeared over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gunwale and I was revealed in the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lantern he held.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sink me!" he shouted. "Here's a man a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lyin' in here-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is he dead?" boomed the commanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are ye dead, shipmate?" questioned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in all seriousness, flashing the lamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">over me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No," I managed to answer.

An' heave!" as they swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">their burden, and then the sullen splash as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body struck the water.

I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed my flag from the "blood and guts''</seg><seg type="columnLine">of old England to the stars and stripes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had twice been in danger of losing my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life--I had no doubt whatever that Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Silvera would have given me a swim had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not Joe Smith recognized me and mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that 1 was a navigator--and here</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was, logged for a lengthy voyage, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceedingly doubtful company, a brute of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portuguese Yankee for skipper, and in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade which I. as a merchant sailor, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested with the hereditary hatred of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluewater shellback. However, I was in no</seg><seg type="columnLine">position to choose. I had benefited by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">change which luck had hove me into, but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nameless dread gripped my heart whenever</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought of the incident of the early morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. and I shivered involuntarily as I step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped into the berth assigned to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scratching a match, I found the bulkhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp and lit it, and by its feeble light I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the room was of the ordinary type, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunk and drawers underneath, a washstand</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a tumbler and water-bottle rack over it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small table and a clothes locker. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot of the bunk was a bookshelf equipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a brine-stained "Navigator.'' by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nathaniel Bowditch, a book of azimuth</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables, "Nautical Almanac," directories and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sailing Directions"; and a few shallow</seg><seg type="columnLine">novels of the type affected by some officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed the library. The bedclothes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bunk were dirty and disarranged, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had another shock when I saw that the pil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low was stained with blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord Harry!" 1 muttered apprehen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sively. "What Lind of a packet have I</seg><seg type="columnLine">blown aboard of?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silvera opened the door at this juncture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He must have noticed me staring at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody pillow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll get th' stooard t' dear that dunnage</seg><seg type="columnLine">away an' put fresh clothes in that bunk,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said as he entered.

Two of the men were vellow-skinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portuguese half-breeds from the Azores,</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Fernandez and Francisco; the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">two were Polynesians--one being, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt, the ugliest and most ferocious look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing character 1 had ever seen. His cheeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">were tattooed in bluish concentric rings</seg><seg type="columnLine">while his huge white teeth were filed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw-like poin ts. When he smiled, the aspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his countenance was frightful and repel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent. All four were clad in colored flannel</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirts, and they ate like wolves, boiled beef</seg><seg type="columnLine">and coffee disappearing down their capaci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous mouths like coal into a furnace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Whaler</seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having spent a good deal of time in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Southern States, I could be excused for</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering why four "blacks" were allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to eat aft in the cabin. The skipper must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have sensed my mental astonishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me make ye acquainted with th'</seg><seg type="columnLine">second an' fourth mates." Fernandez and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco nodded. "The other gents are</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hilo Peter an' Tahiti Jack--our harpoon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Polynesians grinned acknowledg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, Tahiti Jack looking a veritable ogre</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his disfigured cheeks and serrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have seen some hard cases in my day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that whaler's crew impressed me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">being the most cut-throat looking crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ever clapped eyes on. Not a man but</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had a scar or disfigurement of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort on his person; all had a lurching hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitten appearance, while the language they</seg><seg type="columnLine">used was vile enough for an Atlantic packet</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship's fo'c's'le.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE vessel seemed to me to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather an unusual craft for the whal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing business, by recollection of sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry Nantucketers and Vineyard Haven</seg><seg type="columnLine">"spouters" I had seen at sea being vastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">different from the A returns in almost every</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. The orthodox South-Seaman was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">square-stemed, apple-bowed type f&gt;f wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammer; clumsy looking, with wretchedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut sails, bowsprit steeved up like a mast, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">housed-in poop, and no sail above topgal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Arcturus had clipper lines and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the appearance of a clipper; her yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">were very square, her masts lofty and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rake aft, and the length of mast above her</seg><seg type="columnLine">main royal induced me to believe that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">once crossed a sky sail yard. She was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clipper to sail as well. Silvera afterwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me that she had beeen built for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"live ebony" trade--otherwise slaving--</seg><seg type="columnLine">out when she had been put out of that busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness he and a few others had bought her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitted her out for whaling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something of her appearance was spoiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the ungainly whaleboat davits--three to</seg><seg type="columnLine">starboard and one to port. Two spare boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay bottom-up on the gallows aft, and amid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships were placed the brick tryworks, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge pile of kindling-wood stacked around</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. On top of the for'ard house was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great tarpaulined box which, I deduced was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a water tank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I counted thirty men in our crew. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to have been composed of even' na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionality under the sun--Americans, Portu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guese, Scotch, English, Polynesians, Scandi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">navians, and negroes; a rough-and-tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking crowd, but all expert whalemen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">filling the positions of harpooners, boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">steerers, coopers, blacksmiths and seamen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So much for the Arcturus and her company.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">I DRINK WITH SILVERA</seg><seg type="columnLine">WE PICKED up the northeast trades</seg><seg type="columnLine">after sighting Gran Canaria, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunshine, under blue skies and over bluer</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, we ambled lazily on our aimless</seg><seg type="columnLine">course. At night we hove to in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover the whaling grounds in daylight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silvera remained as agreeable as ever, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man seemed to be utterly heartless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I can not say he was severe in hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling the crew; in fact he permitted liberties</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would not have been tolerated for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant upon merchant ships. He was pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant to talk to and a good conversationalist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I cannot remember in any of his dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">courses with me a single sentence which</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed a trace of sympathetic utterance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was an atheist and a man who scorned</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion of any sort, and from the amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of knowledge he seemed to possess regarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Congo and Bonny Rivers. Benin and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dahomey coast, I surmised that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a slaver captain or officer at some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his life. Men who can calmly ''jettison'"</seg><seg type="columnLine">their living cargo into a shark-infested sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">when pursued by a cruiser, have case-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardened their hearts against any appeal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling and compassion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking over the notes from which I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">compiling this narrative, I find but a daily</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequence of entries for the next two weeks:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine weather. Wind N. E., fresh. Vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">under all plain sail running to s'thard. People em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ployed on gear. No fish sighted. Lat. by obs.-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long.-Log.-Bar.-. So ends this day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At night we brought to the wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> According to my instructions from Sil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vera, we gave the Cape Verde Islands a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide berth and stood well over to the east-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward of the thirtieth meridian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A good whalin' ground," explained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper. "Then we'll go to the Brazil</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But luck seemed to have deserted us on</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching our objective point, and though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mast lookouts were manned all day, not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single hail of "There she blows!" was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we were right in the track of the home-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward-bound ships from Australia and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cape bound for the British Channel, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as the outward ships from American</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports, we saw many of them at a distance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the desire for sighting and hailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing vessels which is imbued in all deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">water sailormen, Silvera would always evince</seg><seg type="columnLine">an interest in the Cape Horners flying past</seg><seg type="columnLine">and endeavor to speak them. As home-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward-bound deep water clippers are in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurry to get to port, none of them thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of backing the maintopsail to "gam" with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dirty "spouter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Too good a breeze hereabouts for those</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows. Captain," I remarked one day, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big dipper with stuns'l out had ignored our</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal. "We'll have to get down in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Variables for speaking ships. Up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trades they're all for cracking on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, I reckon so/' he answered. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want t' git some stuff for th' medicine chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' a little lime-juice. Don't want no scurvy</seg><seg type="columnLine">t* break out now th fresh meat an' vegeta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bles are done."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THUS passed the lazy days. Tack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to windward for a day; lying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">at nights, and running down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind at times, we literally became an ocean</seg><seg type="columnLine">loafer. Whales were conspicuous by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">absence and I would have welcomed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of one as eagerly as the oldest whale-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man aboard. I was becoming heartily tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this dolce far nientc, with nothing to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">but squint at the sun and wind up a chro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nometer. There were no books aboard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">save what I found in my own room, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">while away the time I read the trashy novels</seg><seg type="columnLine">from cover to cover and even perused the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry Sailing Directories and the "Nautical</seg><seg type="columnLine">Almanac."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had thought of taking Silvera in hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and teaching him the use of sextant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chronometer, but on second thought I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dedded that the less he knew about naviga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion the better for me. That he knew noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about the science was correct, as I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not long in finding out. Though it struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">me as being rather an unusual thing for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">master of a deep-sea vessel to be ignorant</seg><seg type="columnLine">of navigation, yet it was by no means un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> common in certain trades. In the Pacific,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had known island trading vessels in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand of masters who were not qualified as</seg><seg type="columnLine">navigators, while many sealers have two</seg><seg type="columnLine">captains--one as sailing master and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other a practical sealer and ice expert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> l he skipper's penchant for chasing ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sels was encouraged by me, as I hoped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">beg some reading matter from the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft that would wait for a boat from us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So, when f came on deck one morning and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found us storming after a big full-rigged</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship whose upper canvas was just lifting</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the horizon to the east'ard, I was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager as any one aboard to overhaul her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With royals mastheaded we brought the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship broad on the bow before noon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">though she had lower and topmast stuns'is</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, we were overhauling her hand over</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have a squint at her," said Silvera,</seg><seg type="columnLine">handing me the glass. "What d'ye think</seg><seg type="columnLine">she is?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "English ship," I answered, as &gt;o&lt;.n as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at her. "Australiaman or a tea</seg><seg type="columnLine">packet from China. She's a big lump of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel, but I think we could sail rings round</seg><seg type="columnLine">her-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Waal, we'll have a closer look at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' see ef we kin induce her stubr rn lime-</seg><seg type="columnLine">juice skipper to back his maintops ii for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spell. We'll go below an' have dinner now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had never known Silvera to be so pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant before. He joked with the officers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kanakas, and laughed heartily over my</seg><seg type="columnLine">remark that "the homeward - bounders</seg><seg type="columnLine">would think that the Flying Dutchman had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted his cruising ground by the way we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were chasing them all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a pointless joke, but it evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">tickled his fancy immensely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ha! Ha! Ha! Flyin' Dutchman!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">guffawed. "Great--simply great, Dixon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll crack a bottle over that, by Godfrey!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stoo'ard! Fetch a bottle of rum here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The liquor was brought. I filled my</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass and drank to his good health. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarce put his lips to the tumbler before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco sung out down the companion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better come on deck, Cap'en.

"Why don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">he die or git well-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he stepped up the companion he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and spoke to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Whaler</seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''You'll excuse me a minute, Dixon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hagen is delirious again, I cal'late.

The patrolling of the sailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks; the chasing of many ships upon triv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ial pretenses; the nature of our crew, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skipper's peculiar conversations. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessels had been looted--I had no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever that the ship we chased when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was drugged had been despatched in a man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner similar lo the Sea King--and upon both</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships were confederates who in some mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious manner had means of communi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cating with Silvera.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How was it all arranged?

What would</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen to me? It was a disturb - ig ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and I realized my helplessness. Could</seg><seg type="columnLine">Silvera do without my services? I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer. It was a deuce of a position for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to be in, but after a vast amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain-racking, I concluded that the less I</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretended to know about what had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened the better for me. If Silvera thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I suspected his game, I had absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt but what I would be given a toss</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sharks. Men of Silvera's type had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">compunctions. I knew that already.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My action after this may seem strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but you must remember the state of mind I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in. I had been an eyewitness of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">act of piracy on the high seas. I was among</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crowd of suspicious cutthroats who</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished me to know nothing; a ship and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">human freight was being sunk alongside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was supposed to be oblivious to it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a drugged slumber. To calm my nerves</seg><seg type="columnLine">and add realism to my feigned sleep, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured out a small drink from the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle and tossed it off. Within a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could feel the drug working its soporific</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence. I had a faint recollection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing the boom of the gun again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I lost consciousness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">I CARRY OUT A PLAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">T AWOKE naturally and saw that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was daylight. The steward was setting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breakfast on the cabin table, and feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if I had passed a nightmarish sleep, 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Whaler</seg><seg type="columnLine">63</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned out, washed and went on deck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The steward looked sharply at me as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed, but his "Good morning, sir!" was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as civil as usual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The skipper was pacing the trunk deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I came up the companion, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hailed me with a laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By th' great horse-block!" he cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Have ye really woke up?

Yet Silvera had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he was delirious and dying!</seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the weeks which passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on our run to the south'ard. the skip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per treated me with every courtesy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I guarded my emotions so well that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">never suspected for a: moment that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of the crimes which he and his crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">had committed. Lideed, things were so</seg><seg type="columnLine">monotonous and usual, that I began to doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself; the whole affair seemed but a vivid</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though I hunted around for proofs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">substantiate my suspicions, yet absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing could I find. No trace was there</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any gun aboard, nor did I ever run across</seg><seg type="columnLine">any weapons other than a shotgun in Sil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vera's room. I knew that the officers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolvers--most officers have--but rifles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutlases, cannon and shells were conspicu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous by their absence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I was not an officer of the ship I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no right to go prying around the vessel, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the occasional strolls I made to the fo'-</seg><seg type="columnLine">c's'le head I found nothing to characterize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ardurus as being anything but what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was--a whaling bark bound on her lawful</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasions with a perfect right to cruise</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherever she listed in pursuit of the ceta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceans. I might, have got substantial proof</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I could examine the lazaretto, yet I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that any attempt on my part would mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden death. I did not try.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We passed the East Falklands after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine run down, and we crossed Burdwood's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bank to edge up to the stormy comer of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southern world. The weather was fine for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high latitudes--fresh sou'westerly wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a smooth sea--and with royals furled we</seg><seg type="columnLine">swashed on our lonely way. I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep all afternoon on the third day after</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing the Falklands, and in my stocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet I ascended the companion for a breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fresh air. The night was black dark.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Filling my pipe in the gangway, I stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">on deck intending to ask the watch officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a match. As I passed along the lee</seg><seg type="columnLine">alley towards the break rail. I heard my</seg><seg type="columnLine">name mentioned by some one over to wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, and stopped to listen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the sough of the wind and the wash</seg><seg type="columnLine">from our passage through the water, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversationalists were obliged to speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">loudly, and being to leeward I caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words distinctly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get him out o' th' way after we make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Island. . . .

So that was the lay! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wras to be used for my navigating abilities</seg><seg type="columnLine">in picking up some Pacific Island rendez-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vous and then cast adrift like a worn-out</seg><seg type="columnLine">swab. Red Shirt would navigate the bark</seg><seg type="columnLine">to San Francisco--any one who could steer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and keep track of a log could do that; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">picking up some isolated Pacific atoll re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired more accurate knowledge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slipping quietly into my room, I lit my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe and turned into my bunk to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">things out. A number of schemes came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind, but I dismissed them all as im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">probable and impossible. I had no friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the crew whom I could rely upon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All were deep in the scheme and none would</seg><seg type="columnLine">act against Silvera. Joe Smith, my former</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipmate of the blockade days, had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken a word to me since the eventful</seg><seg type="columnLine">night I fell aboard the bark, and I knew I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could expect nothing from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Escape was impossible. If I attempted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swim to a passing ship I would be shot or</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly recaptured, and the chances of</seg><seg type="columnLine">swimming in the icy seas of the Southern</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ocean were not feasible. I couldn't launch</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boat without some one seeing or hearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I had to dismiss that. I had no weap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ons other than a sheath-knife, and even if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a revolver, what could I do with it?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shoot Silvera and a few others, maybe, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would not be long before I would be killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself. No, I had to admit that my chances</seg><seg type="columnLine">were mighty slim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I reached down a chart of Cape Horn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Straits of Magellan and studied it for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, and I remembered how, that very</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning I had to explain to Silvera the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great easterly variation which prevailed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vicinity. He had questioned me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard to the amount of wasting in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">course I had given him; in his ignorance he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reckoned when steering south, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">course should necessarily be south, varia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, deviation and other errors of the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass being a mystery to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It w'as the easterly variation which gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">me the idea. Desperate and all as it was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I decided that it was the only thing I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. If I were destined to die, then I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take good care that others went with me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Briefly, I determined that 1 w'ould put</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Arcturus ashore on one or other of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous rocks which fringed the Horn!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 lay awake the best part of the night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking and thinking. At da s light I</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped into my pocket a steel watchchain</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had found in the desk and went on deck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco, the watch officer, was lolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the break rail for'ard, and a stupid</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chileno was at the wheel. Going over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the compass 1 told him to steer by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather leach of the mainto'gallan's'i for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute. Standing in front of him, I took</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the binnacle hood, noted the point at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lubber mark on the compass, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipping the steel chain under the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the card I placed the cover on</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," I growled to the helmsman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Keep her as she w'as."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I left him pulling the spokes over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">head up on the vast amount of westing I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had introduced into the compass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now!" I muttered. "I'll play a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">game of my own, Captain Silvera, and we !!</seg><seg type="columnLine">see who wins out--you or me. If I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">pile you up inside of twenty-four hour; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm a Dutchman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At noon I got a sight, and fixed our posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion as some eighty miles northwest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Staten Island. There was a fresh breeze</seg><seg type="columnLine">blowing and we were logging seven to eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">knots with a southerly wind. We were sail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing close-hauled, heading about W. S. W.</seg><seg type="columnLine">by correct compass course, but in reality</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bark was actually making that course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as my steel chain more than compensated</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the easterly variation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, sir," I said to the skipper, after I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shown him our position on the chart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"we'll be opening out the Horn by daylight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we're feeling the set of the South Drift</seg><seg type="columnLine">now.

We've plenty of sea room to clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cape St. John and w*e w'ant to make all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">westing we can while the wind holds."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded curtly. When he went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck, I heard him singing out for the fore</seg><seg type="columnLine">and main royals, topmast staysails and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaff-topsail to be set.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," said I to myself, "slam away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you bloody-minded pirate! Four bells in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first watch'll have us trying to push</seg><seg type="columnLine">Staten Island out of the water and a grand</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ice shore the cliffs will make with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">souther blowing.

I paced the quarter, smoking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until nine o'clock. Looking over the log</seg><seg type="columnLine">slate in the chart-house, I made a mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculation of our position as being about</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen miles off the land. The breeze still</seg><seg type="columnLine">held strong and the vessel was storming</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily on the course I had laid for her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Within two hours she would strike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced around the ship, heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">growling talk of the watch mustered aft in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lee of the half deck, smoking and yarn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; heard a ribald chorus come from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fo'c's'le, and saw Fernandez steadily pacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weather alley. Silvera was below asleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The harpooners were playing cards in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">half deck. A shivering negro tugged with</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittened hands at the spokes of the wheel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All were oblivious to impending disaster.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they deserved the fate I had in store</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them, and when I felt my nerve waver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, I thought of the murdered crews of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Albemarle and Sea King. Aye! I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">save my sympathy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went below and locked myself in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Sitting on the transom I made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental overhaul of my life, and, finding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slate fairly clean, waited calmly for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crash which meant the end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER DC</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      SILVERA AND I ARE QUITS</seg><seg type="columnLine">HTHE reader of this narrative will proba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">A bly think I was extremely phlegmatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my desperate actions. I was. Life held</seg><seg type="columnLine">very little for me then. I had no home and</seg><seg type="columnLine">no relations, no friends except an odd ship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate here and there. I held a master's cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tificate, but hard times and hard experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ences had practically killed all my ambition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I hated the life I was living; hated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea; hated everything. Existence for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">had by now developed into a mere pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longation of life by eating and drinking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scheming and planning had jaded my brain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was quite prepared to die if I could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of blotting out the horde of scoundrels</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was shipmates with. God would give me</seg><seg type="columnLine">credit for that, I was sure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Therefore it was with an easy conscience</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I waited for the inevitable, and with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out any nervousness I turned into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunk. When the bark struck, I would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main where I was. Just as easy to die below</seg><seg type="columnLine">decks as to be engulfed and tossed about in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I must have fallen into an apathetic doze,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for when I awoke it was to hear Femande2</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream inarticulate words down the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panionway. The quietness of the night was</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken by a sonorous booming. When a</seg><seg type="columnLine">medley of shouts and running feet sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead, I knew we wTere in the breakers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt the bark staggering and lurching,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the steward open his door and clatter</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the ladder, and Silvera roaring and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some one shrieked, "Hard down! Hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">down!" and then came a frightful shock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was hurled bodily to the floor. I made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no attempt to rise, but lay where I fell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening to the thunder of the waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaching over the vessel and the hoarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouts of the panic-stricken crew. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bark was lifting and pounding with dreadful</seg><seg type="columnLine">concussions upon the rock or ledge, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">amidst the din of falling spars, rending</seg><seg type="columnLine">woodwork and crashing seas, the voice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Silvera could be heard directing the launch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of a boat with frightful oaths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All hands seemed to have swarmed aft</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to the poop. I could hear the stamping</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shuffling of their booted feet on the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">above me; their yells and curves, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boom and crash of the boarding breakers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I remember Slocum bawling some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about "dead wall of rock ahead" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"drop off jibboom." There was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamping of the booted feet, and some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">clattered down the companion ladder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dixon,you swine! Ahoy, Dixon! Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">are you, you dog! Bum my soul, but I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut yer heart out!" and a string of vile</seg><seg type="columnLine">oaths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Silvera. I made no answer. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">groped about in the darkness until he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my door. He tried the handle. Finding</seg><seg type="columnLine">it locked, he roared:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Open th' door, you--! You've</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiked me, but by - I'll spike youl</seg><seg type="columnLine">Open!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Receiving no answer, he hammered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the panels with his fists, snarling like a dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swearing dreadfully. The vessel shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered to the shocks of the waves breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her. Then came a resounding crash</seg><seg type="columnLine">66</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the deck above, with a splintering and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tearing of woodwork; and a roaring welter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sea came like a cataract into the cabin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The water was spurting into my room</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the cracks in the door. I expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the end was coming. Silvera was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cabin, but he had desisted from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">endeavor to force an entrance to my room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I expect he thought I was dead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE water was swashing over my</seg><seg type="columnLine">body with every pound of the vessel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she suddenly canted to star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board and I was thrown violently against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bulkhead. As my room was to port</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water drained out, and I found myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying on the wet planking and still very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much alive. Instead of wishing to die, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire to live was beginning to take pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">session of me, and I rose to my feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The vessel was not pounding now, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">though she trembled to the shocks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas which broke over her hull, yet it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to me she was far from breaking up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The massive oak beams and stanchions in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my berth were still holding in spite of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful hammering the bark had undergone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I noticed that the oak hanging-knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not started, nor had the planking open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed up. I could not see through the port,</seg><seg type="columnLine">owing to the fact that the deadlights had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been shipped over them when we passed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rio Plata in readiness for the stormy</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather of the Horn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shocks were perceptibly lessening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as I puzzled myself for an explanation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I remembered the tide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, to be sure, the tide is falling, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we must have canted over with our decks</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the shore." Thus thinking, I struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">a match and lit a candle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quietly unlocking my door I peered out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lee side of the cabin was swashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with water and littered with the debris of</seg><seg type="columnLine">table and seats. A great gap where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skylight had been yawned overhead, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the square of gray daylight which</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed came streams of chilly spray. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">candle was blown out, but there was enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">light to discern things by. As I glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the flooded apartment I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sign of Silvera.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Must have gone on deck," I murmured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scrambling across the sloping floor I</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled up the companionway and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around on the ruin I had wrought. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">blowing very hard and the spindrift from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the welter of whitcwater we were lying in</seg><seg type="columnLine">was flying athwart the air. Ahead towered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great wall of cliff which loomed hazily in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the half light of the semi-antarctic morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and which was blotted from sight inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittently by veils of rainy mist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I he vessel was lying over on her star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board bilge with her bottom facing seaward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the masts had gone by the board and</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be seen in a tangled ralBe of spars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas and cordage, swashing among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks at the foot of the dills. The for'ard</seg><seg type="columnLine">house was still standing, and I made out</seg><seg type="columnLine">something which had been a mystery to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tank which had once reposed on top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house had disappeared, and in its stead</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw the shining barrel of a cannon known</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a Parrott rifle-gun!</seg><seg type="columnLine">AS MY eyes got used to the gloom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw that we were lying in a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">indentation in the cliff wall--a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cove or fiord with a litter of broken rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and boulders rising in a steep* pile to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apex of a triangle formed by two unbroken</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of stone. By crawling for'ard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clambering out on the bowsprit, :t would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to drop on to dry land. And with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the craving for life still strong within me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped below to ransack the pantry for</seg><seg type="columnLine">food and water. The storeroom lay to</seg><seg type="columnLine">starboard, and to reach it I had to wade</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist deep in chilly water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Entering, I stulled my pockets and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside of my shirt with biscuits and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">dried apples. There was no water in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, and trusting to find some when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the shore, I crawled along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather rail to the fo'c's'le head and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the bowsprit. The headstavs were dang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling down from the spar, and I was soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipping and sprawling around on the weed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kelp covered rocks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before 1 gained high-water mark, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">destined to stumble, over three almost un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognizable bodies, but the sight excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">no qualms of conscience. They deserved</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fate, and though I had the blood of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some thirty-three men on my head, 1 felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had become but an instrument of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vengeance in the hands of a just Deity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heedless of the cold, I scrambled up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slippery boulders to the apex of the cleft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was with some satisfaction that I noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the cliffs were not so inaccessible as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they appeared from seaward. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous ledges and cracks which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Whaler</seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg><seg type="columnLine">not make climbing difficult to a sailorman</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to scaling giddy heights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was tightening my belt and buttoning</seg><seg type="columnLine">up my coat in preparation to make the as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent, when I heard the rattle of boulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind me, and I wheeled around in time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see Silvera in the act of hurling a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock in my direction. With a smothered</seg><seg type="columnLine">oath, he hove the stone, and I leaped aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time to escape being dashed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">TWy I HAD no weapons, and I was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">^5 match for Silvera in strength. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see by the terrible look in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes that he meant to kill me, and so, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed toward me with his great hands out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched to grasp my throat, I picked up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small stone and struck him square in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face with it. He stopped and clapped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands to his mouth. While I backed away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he grabbed another piece of jagged rock and</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced with the blood streaming from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nose and his tangled beard streaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">white with crusted salt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll fix you, my bully!" he roared. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">think you've finished my hash-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I leaped behind a huge sea-bleached</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone just as he hurled his missile, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he stooped to pick up another, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelted him with all my strength with an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other small piece of rock. It struck him on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cheek, cutting it to the bone, and wrhile</seg><seg type="columnLine">I grabbed two more, he drove a chunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">smack into my ribs with terrific force. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped and hurled both my missiles at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One missed, but the other bowled him over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Following up my advantage, I grasped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large stone and launched it at his head. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck him square in the middle of the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he rolled over, and he collapsed with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">growl of rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several times he attempted to rise to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, but somehow or other he was powerless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While I waited with another stone poised to</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain him with as soon as he gained his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees, he gave an agonized cry, more like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of a wild beast than of a human being,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shrieked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kill me! Kill me! My back is broken!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as I watched him groveling on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pebbles and clawing out with his hands in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vain effort to rise, I saw that this evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the case. My missile had caught him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the small of the back just as he was jump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to his feet, and the blow had broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I stepped up to him, still holding on to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone. He snarled at me like a trapped wolf.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His face dripped blood, and with his matted</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair, tangled beard, and the eyes literally</seg><seg type="columnLine">ablaze with hate and savage defiance, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a frightful picture as he lay on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravel with his fingers tearing into the peb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bles in his helpless rage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">gj"g "CAPTAIN SILVERA!" I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">inmi calmly. "You and I arc quits now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      You've got to make your peace with</seg><seg type="columnLine">God for the lives you have sent into eternity</seg><seg type="columnLine">for greed of gold.

It's you that has done</seg><seg type="columnLine">all this! It's you that piled th' vessel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," I answered. "I piled her up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did it purposely-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You did?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He snapped the question out doubtfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Aye, I did. I fixed your compass; told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to crack on, and there's the result."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I pointed to the hulk King a cable's</seg><seg type="columnLine">length belowr in the spume and froth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What-made you do that?" he said after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause, a little more calmly. "I always</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated you well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," I replied, "and I was to navigate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bark to Hiva Nuku and then you'd toss</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to the sharks. It was my skill as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">navigator which saved me, that's all. You'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have hove me over the side off Nantucket</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shoals if Joe Smith hadn't told you I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been an officer. I owe you nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He remained quiet for a spell and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage light died out of his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you know?' he inquired at</seg><seg type="columnLine">length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know' that you and your crew were</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing more than pirates pretending to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">whalers," I answered.

I wasn't drugged the time the Sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">King was looted. I did not drink the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">until after the crime wTas committed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "D'ye think I'll die?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll die ultimately," I replied without</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion. "We may both die, but 3'ou'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">die first.

Thus, at the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of three years, the hurrying by of the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">trains aroused a species of resentment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every one was at liberty to take flight but</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Then again, fifty dollars a month for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his combined duties was hardly a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pensating solace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the matter of salary that caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea to germinate while he was sullenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">working the semaphore one day.

By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it was exhausted he could obtain an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other position in a pleasing environment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In logical sequence he decided he might as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well allow his imagination a wider range</seg><seg type="columnLine">and play at taking a vacation with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">largest sum ever entrusted to his care for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single night.

In this fashion</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took a hurried excursion across the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinent and spied out the land.

Of course, there might be two</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars entrusted to him any night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially now that it was Autumn and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumbermen were stocking up for the Winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">campaign.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was at that precise point that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheek reddened and he felt a touch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm as he angrily told himself such</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagining was immoral, for it was based</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the suggestion that he steal the money.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He condemned the suggestion wrathfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he walked a quarter of a mile to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonely home where he boarded, and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was more downcast than ever over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his colorless place in life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On returning to the station to close up</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the night, which meant a weary wait for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the up-passenger to pull in, he returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suggestion abruptly and recklessly. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">wTas the sight of the porters making up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">berths, the comradeship in the smoking</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment, that plunged him into full</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolt; only now he proceeded on the theory</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money was legitimately his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I guess I've earned it.

How would I spend it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This surrender eased him much.

Fortunately there is no law</seg><seg type="columnLine">punishing a man for inwardly discussing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible assets of a crime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, Parsly merely intended to pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sue his day-dreams unhampered by any</seg><seg type="columnLine">irritating self-criticism. He had systematic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally arranged his data and could spend a</seg><seg type="columnLine">million a day, should he choose. That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he erred. His imagination became a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard taskmaster, very exacting. Once he</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted the suggestion that the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to come to him through theft, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">methodical mind insisted on reviewing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibilities of detection before permitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to enjoy the fruits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wouldn't you be caught and arrested</seg><seg type="columnLine">before you could make a beginning?" was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cautious query he was forced to put to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such nagging is very annoying, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfy his mysterious Pu rrhonist and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinue with his Spanish architecture, he set</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself about planning how the trick could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be done without his being detected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was a hopeless morass at first, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">very unpleasant; for instead of picturing</seg><seg type="columnLine">innocent expenditures he found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweating and struggling with the problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">of how he could keep the money once he</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured it. The more he labored the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">nimble became his other self in raising perti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent objections, exploding seemingly sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">theories and ridiculing his most astute</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypotheses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To merely appropriate the money and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappear was quickly shown to be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of idiocy'. That spelled a life of</seg><seg type="columnLine">slinking and fear, the flying from phann'ms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It ttook some thought to clear the fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground of discarded theories and plans and</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach the realm of finesse; but at last he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be building on a firmer founda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Probably the frequent raids by veggmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">on rural post-offices and isolated railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">stations stimulated this office of his imagina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. For in reading the paper, presented</seg><seg type="columnLine">him gratis each evening by the newsboy on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the up-passeuger, he noted the veggmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">always securely tied whoever stood between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and loot, cut the tell-tale wires and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cscaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the great idea; and slapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paper he glanced apprehensively around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the small office, and whispered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I faked a holdup the yeggs would get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the credit and I'd get the dough. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a cinch, if a man wanted to play</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stay'! Was it so easy? The various</seg><seg type="columnLine">precautions necessary for counterfeiting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbery, each simple in itself, quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed into mountains. Then he decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">on just how the furniture should be broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">It Might Have Happened Otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg><seg type="columnLine">and overturned to approximate realism;</seg><seg type="columnLine">just when the wires should be cut; whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">the station door should be left open or</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed, and the condition of his clothing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets. As there was no safe in the office</seg><seg type="columnLine">the agent carried the moneys upon his per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. At first he imagined his pockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned inside out, then repudiated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought as being too clumsy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what about the tying-up portion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the programme? Could a man tie himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">so as to convince his rescuers that his pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicament was genuine? Of course, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance, rather a good one, too, of his land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lord, foreman of the section crew, coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his aid and cutting the cords without</seg><seg type="columnLine">making any particular observations. Still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only perfection of detail would satisfy his</seg><seg type="columnLine">exacting critic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, Parsly, if slow of thought at times,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dogged in his persistence once he grap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pled with a problem. He now gave his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spare time to studying ropes and knots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The newspapers had charged up the vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous robberies to Fresno Red and his gang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had dwelt at length on the method</seg><seg type="columnLine">used in each case in tying up watchman or</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent. Invariably one end of the rope was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made fast about the feet and ankles of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captive, then passed up and around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist, the hands being caught and tied be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the back; the loose end finally being</seg><seg type="columnLine">made fast about the captive's neck in a slip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was done very quickly, each victim had</seg><seg type="columnLine">averred, and so hampered a man that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more he struggled the more he endangered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life by self-strangulation. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">method worthy of the redoubtable Fresno</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red, and one Parsly now attacked to satisfy</seg><seg type="columnLine">his insistence on correct detail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT night he surreptitiously car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried a piece of new rope home. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already discovered that new</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope would not slip like old, smoothly worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope. In the secrecy of his small chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">he essayed the simple task of tying his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. His heart beat rapidly as he pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knot tight; then he laug'hed vacuously</seg><seg type="columnLine">and told himself it was all a game. It ended</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it began, merely a pastime. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not attempt to duplicate the veggmen's</seg><seg type="columnLine">knots further that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would not concede that he stood in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of the trooping suggestions now be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting h:m and eagerly offering aid. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fought hard to put the thoughts from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind during the morning hours and felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremely virtuous as he handed the down</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent the customary parcel of money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night he relaxed and deftly tied his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, passed the line about his waist and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumsily wound it around his wrists. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained awake more than an hour trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to solve the rest of the problem--how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fasten the rope about his wrists so it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be impossible to free himself and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure the end about his neck. He decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">it couldn't be done, and fell asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toward morning, when but half awake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard a voice adWse--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tie the rope first about the neck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He popped up to a sitting posture and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared wildly about the dark chamber. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it was a suggestion from his inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, yet so distinctly did he hear the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed as if they must have been voiced</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud. Throughout the early morning he</seg><seg type="columnLine">brooded over the suggestion. At first he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not discern any sense in it. Subcon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciously, however, he had often noticed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumberman's trick of using a clove-hitch--</seg><seg type="columnLine">two half-hitches--and gradually the recol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lection thrust itself above the threshold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness. He believed he had succeeded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He must make the rope fast about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck while standing, then secure it about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ankles with practically no slack, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuing the loose end to his waist and tying</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, talung care to have it pass outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope running from neck to heels. Then by</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing back his head and heels he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtain enough slack to make the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">double loops, or half - hitches, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he could work his wrists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last operation, he realized, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">demand great care, as he must thrust his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands in from opposite direcions until wrist</seg><seg type="columnLine">overlapped wrist. If it would work he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would dismiss the matter and resume the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasing visions of spending the money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning's paper contained a glaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">account of a daring yegg robbery at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Centerville station. The agent had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">trussed up and some fifteen hundred dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those guv's certainly got the nerve,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">commented the newsboy as the agent was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading the item. "Didn't even gag</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roberts. Just corded him up like a bale</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hay, copped his roll and beat it. Roberts</seg><seg type="columnLine">is so scared he's working his notice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That afternoon Parsly was curious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">M</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">examine all baggage fastened with ropes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Several parcels of sample dowels, sent by</seg><seg type="columnLine">express from the up-country mill, held his</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention the closest. They were tied with</seg><seg type="columnLine">new rope and the clove-hitch held tightly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even when he worked an end loose. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he closed up for supper the branch</seg><seg type="columnLine">train brought in a hundred-odd dollars, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the agent confidentially assured:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tomorrer'U be a record breaker. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">parties I know of are going to send down a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand per. Together with the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">money you'll have close to three thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones to nurse over night. The danged</seg><seg type="columnLine">company ought to put a safe in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">office."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Off duty for the night, he hastened to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">room where the supreme test awaited him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he succeeded there was nothing to pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent a man from robbing himself and leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing no clues. When from the open door he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could catch the sound of his landlord's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy, regular breathing, he removed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes, seated himself on the edge of the bed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and began experimenting with the cord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fastened the noose about his neck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up and noted where the rope in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct line touched the floor. Then seating</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself he tied it tightly about his ankles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brought the loose end up to and around</seg><seg type="columnLine">his waist. There was scarcely any slack</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he straightened out his legs. At first</seg><seg type="columnLine">he feared he had drawn the cord too tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, anxiously turning on his face, threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">back his head and heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a thrill of elation he found the slack</seg><seg type="columnLine">would enable him, by an effort, to form the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitch. After a moment's fumbling he suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded, and even wriggled his hands through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loops until the tips of the fingers rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the upper forearm. It wearied him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sigh of physical relief he extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">his legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In an instant his tongue felt too large for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouth, and with a gasp of horror he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided he was choking to death. He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose his nerve as he remembered the remedy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he drew back his legs. But although</seg><seg type="columnLine">this gave a bit of slack to the rope he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not induce the hitch to loosen. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction of having proven his theory he</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly glided into the fear that he had cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culated too nicely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had the rope been old and smooth, or had</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands been imprisoned palm to palm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger tip to finger tip, he might have secured</seg><seg type="columnLine">a leverage and by working them apart have</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded in wrenching one free. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new rope refused to give, and for a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lay quiet, panting for breath, and taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">great care to bring no strain on his neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down-stairs the old clock was ponder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously ticking off the seconds; and he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained a prisoner. His heart chilled as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared he must summon the foreman to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to his rescue. But how could he</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain his peculiar plight? What suspi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cions might not his predicament arouse?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This dread quickly gave way before one</seg><seg type="columnLine">more chance. The noose seemed to be tight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening about his neck, and he remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foreman was a heavy sleeper. His wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied a room with her small children at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other end of the house. He doubted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability to call help; if he did not he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly strangle to death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Already the cold sweat was trickling into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes and it required a mighty effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the will to restrain himself from thrashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. He knew, however, that the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment he lost control of his nerves and moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">incautiously his wind would be shu* off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gritting his teeth he drew his heels far back</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an acrobat. He was lying face down</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the bedclothes half smothering him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he gently picked at the rope with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger tips. Useless. The cords held his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists like bands of iron.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally he managed to work the cord</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the fingers of his left hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">exert a pressure upward, hoping to loosen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hitch. His essay was barren of results</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some moments, and it was not until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to collapse that he felt his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand moving more freely. With an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">articulate cry of triumph he wrenched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist smartly, and instantly felt the cord</seg><seg type="columnLine">renew its grip like a sentient thing. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a cat playing with a mouse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Breathing in dry sobs he slowly sought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">recover the lost ground and persevered</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he again was pushing upward on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord. For the second time he felt the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand move a bit; this time he worked it</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and forth most gently and at last man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged to pull it free. Even then it required</seg><seg type="columnLine">some minutes to remove the rope from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "- the thing!" he choked, sinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">back exhausted. "It nearly got me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night he dreamed of the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought in by the branch train; only there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were cars and cars loaded with it, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all in gold, and men were removing it</seg><seg type="columnLine">It Might Have Happened Otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg><seg type="columnLine">with huge scoops, just as they shovel out</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow corn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By morning he had regained his normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone and even felt inclined to laugh at him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. After all, had he not done what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">set out to accomplish--to prove a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">could effectually make himself a prisoner?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had he been engaged in a bona fide robbery</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would not have attempted to free him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. His success in escaping detection</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be his utter inability to do so. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">that case, of course, he would expect to en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dure the torture till help reached him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What odds if a man suffered a few hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">of physical agony, if it resulted in supply-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him with several thousand dollars? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">now clearly appreciated that had his experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment been less successful he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been grievously disappointed; the problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have remained an obstacle to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination, and his dangerous, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">alluring, fancies needs must be postponed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the whole he felt rather proud of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">achievement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL day the great idea kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounding through his head. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it in his power to obtain more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than two thousand, possibly three thousand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars without being suspected. His tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ples throbbed and ached as the thought as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailed him. Once or twice during the after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon he was called to the baggage-room to</seg><seg type="columnLine">check a trunk. Each time his gaze involun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarily sought the coil of new rope hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was w'ell known to students of crime</seg><seg type="columnLine">that veggmen pick up their tools on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">premises of the place robbed, traveling un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hampered by the burglar's usual outfit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How natural that they should appropriate a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of this very cord to bind him with!</seg><seg type="columnLine">That would necessitate the shattering of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock, but the door was old and w'eak and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-delivered kick would smash it loose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had no appetite for supper and heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">but little of the foreman's gossip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was saying I'd like to play you a game</seg><seg type="columnLine">of crib tonight if you feel in trim," repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foreman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Crib? Oh, of course. Sure, Danny.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll play crib. I'll be home right after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">up-train pulls out. I'll be home in good</seg><seg type="columnLine">season," eagerly promised Parsly, suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">realizing the foreman might get impatient</seg><seg type="columnLine">at waiting, might take alarm at his board-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er s failure to reach home, and go in search</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him. That would eliminate long, slov,-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours of torture on the office floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I'll be home right after the nine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock goes up," he said. "I won't keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">you waiting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While returning through the woods it</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly came home to him that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned to steal the money. For a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment he felt strongly moved and made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeble pretense of denying the accusation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then with a drawn face he muttered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "- it! Why sidestep? It's been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my nut for days. I'll never get another</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance like this--so much dough and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yeggs near.'1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sought to distract his mind by bitterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">assailing the railroad and express com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panies and assuring himself the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never have occurred to him had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">been paid something beyond a starvation</seg><seg type="columnLine">wage for a fourteen-hour day. It really</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't robbery. Laws were made by men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was reprisal. When it came to the ethic?</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it--only Parsly didn't know what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word meant--he'd earned the money, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least a part of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night connived at his purpose, blow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up cold and desolate and on the verge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a storm. By the time the branch pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, the platform was streaming rivulets from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy downpour, and the express agent</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the office on the run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's the stuff!" he yelped, tossing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">package on the table. "Nothing to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">us and we're going right back. So long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parslv breathed more freely. Sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mixup over freight, or a hot-box, kept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train, with the men careless of the passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, as they had no schedule to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the return run to Waverlv, the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">station, where they would hold the siding</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside, the rain was falling with a thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derous clamor, smearing the window panes</seg><seg type="columnLine">till it was impossible to make out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch-lights directly in front of the station.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parsly rose, his eyes glittering. The money</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be concealed safely till the morrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had never read Poe's story of the pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loined letter, yet instinct urged a simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding-place. He decided on the greasy can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vas coat, hung back of the door. He wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">it only when cleaning the -witch-Iamps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The packge fitted nicely into one capa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious pocket. No one would ever find it</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Now to arrange the stage settings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the overturned furniture, the open door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The door opened. Four men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowding in through the miniature water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall released from the loaded eaves. Parsly</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed them as one entranced, his gaze frozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">with horror. It was no physical fear he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreaded, but for the moment it seemed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if his evil purpose had escaped him and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood crystallizedfcinto tangible shapes, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">a unit of wickedness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nail the mutt!" sharply ordered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader, a man with a heavy shock of red</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the men twisted Parsly's arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him and thrust an iron wrist under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chin. Two others stood near, one hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a revolver, the other caressing a "life-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preserver. The leader was glancing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this occurred in a single motion, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed to cover ages to the stupefied</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent. It was the red-headed man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">prowling gaze that brought Parsly to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses. They were veggmen--Fresno Red</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his gang. They were after the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the leader was seeking the safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man who had seized the agent was</seg><seg type="columnLine">deciding he had never in ail of his strong-arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">jobs encountered so thoroughly frightened a</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim as now', when Parsly's chin hugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in and his strong teeth bit deeply into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">captor's WTist, causing him to scream with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain. At the same instant, the agent's long</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg kicked out, overturning the table and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one lamp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room was plunged in darkness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man with the revolver discharged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon, evoking a shriek of mortal agony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not from the agent. Fresno Red called</seg><seg type="columnLine">loudly for a light while he attempted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike a match. Parsly had the advantage;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew one of the robbers was dead or seri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously wounded, and while every man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his enemy in the darkness, the yeggmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared to injure a pal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Block the door and window!" roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fresno Red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During this brief leeway Parsly's groping</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands found, the office stool and he swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">it around his head in a deadly circle." By</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sickening crunch he knew at least one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enemy was off the active list. Then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">match flared up for a second and the leader's</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver exploded, the agent experiencing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinging sensation in the side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an instant Parsly felt strangely numb;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the stool rose like a llail and the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the "life-preserver" sank to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somehow the agent now felt a riotous</seg><seg type="columnLine">elation. Fear was a very distant emotion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His veins were filled with molten lead in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of blood. He breathed hate rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the smoky air. It was a monstrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that these murderers should seek to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rob his employers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a wild howl of rage he plunged into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remaining two men, kicking and smash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing like a maniac with the fragment of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stool. Out through the door they poured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">another of the gang falling with a'fractured</seg><seg type="columnLine">skull. Then Parsly discovered he was alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood stupidly for a few moments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">weaving back and forth. He aroused him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self as his dull ears caught a familiar sound.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A hand-car was being pumped down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grade. His mind cleared to supernormal</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucidity. He saw his advantage. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been brutally attacked and seriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded. The one man escaping would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged with having stolen the money;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they wrested it from him in the struggle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had fought hard; he'd earned it. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet, should he pull the lever close by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand, he could throw' open the switch</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the line and send Fresno Red crashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the empty coal-cars on the siding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll never get a better chance! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply can't be known and-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" he yelled, springing to the lever</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pulling it back with his last ounce of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No,-you! No!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within the next minute he heard a dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash and knew the yegg leader had collided</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the coal-cars. Then he concluded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet platform w'ould be an ideal place for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-hot body to rest on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     "FOR the love of Mike! Parsly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blgl down and out! One man groaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">v3lv and another dead in the office, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff out here! Good Heavens!" exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horrified foreman as he held up the lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tern. He had come because Parsly had</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to keep liis promise as to the game</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cribbage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he read the full story in the four pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trate forms he collected his wits and dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parsly into the office, meanwhile begging</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to "Wake up," and "Get back his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the row'?" feebly asked Parsly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he remembered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've been shot.

"Five</seg><seg type="columnLine">years-■/"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''You'll get used to it," was my cheering</seg><seg type="columnLine">comment. "What's your name, now?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And bow'd you come to do it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started to turn away from me, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught him by the arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Son," I said, "we try to grin and bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">78</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another here.

Some way they'd taken his</seg><seg type="columnLine">vineyard. So she gathered together a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs and tables, put up the shack which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she graced by the name of "Cafe de la</seg><seg type="columnLine">LSgion," and started to sell coffee to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreign soldiers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wasn't such good coffee, I pointed out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was cheap. And somehow she had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of giving a friendly smile--even a co-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quettish smile--with each cup and still</seg><seg type="columnLine">retaining the respect of the	s.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was the only woman in Sidi-bel-Abbes</seg><seg type="columnLine">who deemed them worthy of being treated</seg><seg type="columnLine">on terms of equality, and the Legion did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not forget. Whenever the companies were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered against the Arabs in the South,</seg><seg type="columnLine">many knapsacks full of loot came back</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the hot sands to Chiquita.

Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derneath that was a shorter garment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy purple, which in turn covered baggy</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouserlets of yellow silk caught up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened at the ankle. It went well with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her olive cheeks and black eyes; she was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">color and piquancy and life sitting up there</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her little slippers poised on the rungs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her high stool,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Riordan? He saw it, never fear. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">she saw him. Which was natural enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. There aren't many big blond Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cans come into the Legion who show un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistakable earmarks of culture and ur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">banity, and have blue eyes that sparkle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and red lips that curve besides.

The taste of that meal stuck in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my memory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But between mouthfuls I got Riordan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">story. It was simple enough, as was mine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got a berth at Bassorah on the Persian</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gulf as supercargo on the tramp Wizard</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of Seattle. A little fight ashore at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oran tied me up with the French authori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties.

"I couldn't see any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing but the governor's face across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pond. Then I got dreams--ye gods,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of maybe bringing a commission home</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the old man through some glor-ee-yus</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed on distant battlefield?" I filled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pause for him. "And they commenced</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening up your eyes even at Marseilles/</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't mention it," he grimaced. "Let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">have wine--red wine--I still have a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, at any rate. We'll drink--we'll all</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink to the Legion.

Chiquita did a roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">business that night--what time she wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing with Riordan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's got real talent." he told me on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way home.

Then he seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismiss the matter, and started humming</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tune.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't hum a tune in the morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though.

"And that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">■what I graduate to when I get turned for</seg><seg type="columnLine">full duty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stared into space as I have seen con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">victs stare in the Death's Row, then turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do they ever fight?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sometimes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sometimes? Say--what is this Legion</seg><seg type="columnLine">for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For?" I said. "My son, it is for France.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is for students of social conditions to talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">about--and do nothing. It is for escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">convicts. It is for hungry men who sell</seg><seg type="columnLine">their souls for five centimes a day. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">for cheap colonization projects. It is for</seg><seg type="columnLine">building roads and cities. It is for the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tection and filthy service of filthy Arabs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and harping Jews who spit on the men that</seg><seg type="columnLine">protect them. It is for fools. Work or</seg><seg type="columnLine">die, march or die, fight and die--c'est la</seg><seg type="columnLine">Legion/"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if you buck-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> l,La cellule, the Zephyrs, or the prison</seg><seg type="columnLine">battalion."	.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "La cellulcl" His face contorted into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible grimace. "I went past the cells.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thirty men in a room nine by twelve. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could smell them thirty feet away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> La gamelle went then, and we broke off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He didn't turn up his nose at it this time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No. He fell on it like a wolf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so his life as a legionnaire began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> l'rom that time he was two distinct per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonalities--by day gloomy, silent, a ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine, coming to life only at night. Wine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">red wine, and the sympathy of Chiquita--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lived for the nights. And so, it seemed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did she. He'd sing songs, and talk to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her pictures--oh, one could see how</seg><seg type="columnLine">things were going. If he happened to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">detained on guard, her face would fall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, one night the sergeant at the gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent me back to repolish my shoes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riordan went on ahead. It was then that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw with my own eyes how far things had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun was just setting when I left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate. The big molten disk swung down</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the hook in the nearby Thessala</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains, and its slanting rays played</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the flat roofs of Sidi-bel-Abbes like</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears from a sea of gold. I remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">how the place looked that evening; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I reached the Cafe de la Legion, those</seg><seg type="columnLine">two were alone in the dim interior. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't hear me. And how could they?</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was standing on tiptoe, crushed against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his breast, his lips on hers. Even th-.- dim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness couldn't hide the light in her ia.ee. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see her tremble from ankles to head;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then her eyes closed-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I coughed, and they turned to me--she</seg><seg type="columnLine">red and sweet and confused. She ran into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kitchen, while he and I bridged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">awkwardness over a liter of wine. But 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him a few things later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Said I:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'd best treat her right. She isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely Chiquita--she's an ideal to these</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who have come to believe that there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more good in the world. Treat her</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong and they'll tear you to pieces."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He merely shrugged, with a remark about</seg><seg type="columnLine">handling his own affairs, so I didn't mention</seg><seg type="columnLine">it again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then one night some one stole the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mainder of his money from under his pillow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was the beginning of the end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perforce he had to stay at the barracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">more now, as he had no money to hire his</seg><seg type="columnLine">washing and polishing done. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">time you get to do that in is after second</seg><seg type="columnLine">soup call in the evening. He'd never done</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chiquita of the Legion</seg><seg type="columnLine">81</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day's work in his life, and "policing up"</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't come natural to him; pretty soon he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to getting into trouble with the non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coms, and finally they soaked him two days'</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellule for a dirty kit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came out of there smelling to heaven,</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with vermin. His eyes were two</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim black, holes in a pasty ashen mask.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the last straw," he swore. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran me around with a knapsack filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand on my back. God! I can hear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">corporal's, 'A droit--droit!'--I'll hear it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my dreams. I'm going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got money?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you're crazy. Without it you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">buck the desert; starvation that will drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to Spanish farmers who are only too</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to give you up; the Arab gendarmes</seg><seg type="columnLine">who will turn you in for the prize-money,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Arab tribes that will cut you up for</seg><seg type="columnLine">your clothes. Even if you pass them you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to have papers at the ports, unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can smuggle aboard. Why don't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait until you get money from home?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wouldn't listen to the last. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed afraid of his daddy. He only shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head, muttering to himself, then finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">took himself off to town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll find some way," he swore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did, too. He came to me an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">later in the canteen, and took me off to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. His face was beaming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's going to lend me the money," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, firing it all at me at once. "And get</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a suit of civilian clothes, and-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on," I said, leading him out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. "You'll be giving this away. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">come with me down to Chiquita's--you</seg><seg type="columnLine">two kids will need Tommy Patten to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">your heads cool."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She says she's going with me, too," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurted then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait until we get there before you tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me any more," I said. "Then we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">straighten out the plans."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, she confirmed what he had said</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting there on his knee back in the lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle cafe kitchen. Man, she was happy--</seg><seg type="columnLine">glancing down at him, and him looking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then rather red as to face. Hers_</seg><seg type="columnLine">the color came and went in her cheeks like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    it1 gl0W-liShts of the Ranabas off</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marsel-Leroo, and every now and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">round arms would tighten 'round his neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a little spasmodic jerk, and her red</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips touch all over his face in a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">6</seg><seg type="columnLine">little kisses. All the while she prattled on</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a happy little kid. Thank the good</seg><seg type="columnLine">God, she said, she had saved enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet this one time in her life. She had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined the good God would be so good</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her. Spain--the Spain her father had</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked about--with Dick'; and an inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pensive little villa--oh, life had turned out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a wonderful thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, though, I had to cut in on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and throw the cold water of common sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her outlook. They were taking grave</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances. They must take every possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">precaution against possible detection and</seg><seg type="columnLine">capture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's what I told her," Riordan broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">in eagerly. "She wants to go with me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They may put the two departures together</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we go, as she suggests, by carts to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast and then over to Spain in a hired</seg><seg type="columnLine">fishing-smack. It is best for me to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances on a steamer and have her follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">on another boat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" she cried. "How do you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what boats are in Oran? You would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave there as soon as possible on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first boat. Perhaps it would be one right</seg><seg type="columnLine">to France. With no papers--no. I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not listen. You could not cable, for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">messages are censored here. Listen--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she turned in appeal to me--"see if</seg><seg type="columnLine">this is not the best plan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was to take his measure, get his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes, then leave the cafe in charge of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl friend. She would then go into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country on a visit to some trustworthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends of her father's. The Arabs they</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed formerly worked for her family,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and these could easily be induced to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">them via cart train to Tjecamen, near Oran</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the coast- They would travel at night</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Dick under cover in case they met a</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrol. Three days she would wait at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend's, so that there might be no con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nection between the two departures; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was to come. Her Arab friends could</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily arrange with the fisherman at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast to take them to Spain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's right," I told Riordan. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">now'--what's going to happen when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">get to Spain?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She buried her face in his neck so quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not see his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What but one thing?" he retorted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We'll be married; then I'll cable the</seg><seg type="columnLine">governor that I'm off to a new' start. He'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">come across then, I'm sure."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "H'm," I said. "Why don't you get</seg><seg type="columnLine">married here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked out from behind her shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty quickly at that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whyl" he exclaimed. "That would</seg><seg type="columnLine">expose us sure. .No one could help putting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two departures together then. Find</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, find the other."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had to admit that he was right, but on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way home I put my hand on his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stopped him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That girl is risking her savings, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">running chances of the prison battalion for</seg><seg type="columnLine">helping a legionnaire desert," I said--"for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She won't have it any other way," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," I said. "She won't. She's that</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind. The governor won't have any cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be ashamed of the kind of grandchildren</seg><seg type="columnLine">she's going to bring him--if she does."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish she'd listen to coming on another</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat,'' he muttered in a troubled tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's got the best plan," I said. "Best</seg><seg type="columnLine">come on now and go to sleep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning we heard that Chiquita</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be gone for a time from the Cafe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We knew then the first move was on. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the next three days Riordan was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidgety I had to keep an eye on him for fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd forget some part of his uniform and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get thrown into cells again. He fretted</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself about a possible slip here and a slip</seg><seg type="columnLine">there until he had me on the raw edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">FINALLY, though, the night came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And how he did polish and primp to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make sure of passing inspection at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gate! I had to warn him for fear his</seg><seg type="columnLine">very eagerness would warn the corporal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our squad that something unusual was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afoot, and had to shake him up again</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we got beyond the gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't run," I scolded. "Stroll along</seg><seg type="columnLine">like I do. I'll lead you out all right."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh!" he said. "Are you going beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But if they catch you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pouf! Two days' barracks arrest for</seg><seg type="columnLine">stealing grapes. You need me. You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">too excited."	j</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid you'll be caught, he insisted;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I wouldn't listen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So we made for the city walls by alley</seg><seg type="columnLine">routes, slipped by a patrol, and went up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and over and away through the vineyards.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 couldn't hold him back then--he hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the Legions' double time, and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We made those two miles in no time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping in the shadows as much as possible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then we heard a swift rustling of soft gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, and Chiquita was in his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I let her have him a minute; but time was</seg><seg type="columnLine">precious. I saw the shadowy carts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arabs waiting near by. I urged him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Change quickly," I told him, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring back every piece of your uniform so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can see that it finds its way to the quarter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">master. If you get caught you don't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be tried for stealing your kit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He slipped into the shadows, and Chi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quita ran to me and clutched at my arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was so good to help--she would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget--surely the good God would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">allow him to be caught.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tut, tut," 1 said, "everything is going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be all right." I assured her that L was</seg><seg type="columnLine">confident they would make it all right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That is what I told her--but I sfca'n't</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon forget standing there with i-hat Ctrl</seg><seg type="columnLine">all atremble beside me. It isn't any too</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant playing a sort of helpless iViter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">father to a young girl that's sincere : r.d</seg><seg type="columnLine">true and good and playing a game for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lover with all her possessions and freedom</seg><seg type="columnLine">at stake. No, it isn't so pleasant--es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecially when you feel all her fears and</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxieties, and being a man and older, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiser, you see t\ lot more she hasn't guessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at as yet. She was that close to me--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling of her hands--the faint, sweet</seg><seg type="columnLine">odor that came from her hair-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, after an age, Riordan appeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She ran to meet him and then walked back</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him toward me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My eyes were on him, inspecting. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes weren't any too good, being second-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand; si ill they fi tted well enough as far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I could see. But I wasn't noticing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much as something that was making</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself felt in his manner--something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">chilled me; and when he handed me his</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniform bundle with a remark about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">new shoes hurting his feet, a strange silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell on us all--a silence that made me sick</seg><seg type="columnLine">at heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She, too, felt it. She looked up at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide-eyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?" she whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chiquita," he said, and stopped. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chiquita of the Legion</seg><seg type="columnLine">83</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice was strange and husky. Then--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I found the money in the clothes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, yes, five hundred francs. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">must handle the purse now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I want that you should take half</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused, then went on with a rush:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have been thinking about this all</seg><seg type="columnLine">along. It is not best that we go together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can go on to one of the up-country stations</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then to Oran by rail--oh, I'll make</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all right -- I'll cable you when I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I remained silent. I was not amazed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I had been halfway expecting this; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I looked at her. She stared at him in utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbelief--it was as if he had struck her a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never have I seen greater misery depicted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a human face. She had guessed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth at last. There was at least some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing honest enmeshed in the bottom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy. His face and eyes were poor liars</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if his words did evade. He had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended to take her with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dick!" she cried very low. I can hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">it yet. It had sadder notes than the Wongo</seg><seg type="columnLine">lament of the women on Leno-La-Nee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A great anger seized me then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You cur!" I choked; and was on him</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a wolf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Big he was, but he stood no show with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in that ;rage. He went ,'dowrn, fighting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but with me on top, my bayonet at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Chiquita grabbed my arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No!" she screamed. "No! Would</seg><seg type="columnLine">you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I'll not kill him," I said. "But I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">make him put on that uniform again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">go back to barracks." And I tightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">my grip on his throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> H'm. . . Yes, Haig and Haig, Willard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Four fingers. . . Yes. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, I expect you're wondering what</seg><seg type="columnLine">came next. I didn't think she'd want me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hurt him--that's a woman's way--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wasn't prepared for what followed.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let him up,' she said, and her voice wras</seg><seg type="columnLine">that strange and quiet I did so in a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance. I have heard the same tones in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices of priests when they give the abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got up stiffly, with a murderous look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me, but stood still--her voice held him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. So they remained, she looking at him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if she couldn't look enough; then she spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You do not know what love is," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him. "Some day you may learn. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will always love you, no matter what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. No--" to me as I tried to speak--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you must let him go. Five years--for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him--in the Legion? Nom du bon Dieu,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would kill him. No! You must keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money--Dick. Now please go!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, that's what that little girl said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out there under the stars in that Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerian night. A girl that was born in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">provinces and had never seen her native</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spain. A girl born near--Beard of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prophet--the Foreign Legion! Yes. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">even in the temperate zone you get to think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that all that's good and noble is pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured on the stage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for him, he mumbled something--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't talk--and stumbled off through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness, while she watched him, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dry-eyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No, she didn't break down. If she did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she kept it from me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ah! One needs a drink, remembering a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene like that. A little more ice, Willard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thanks. . . It sticks in the memory. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well--it stuck in his memory, too. Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he made it all right. Made it to Florence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the American colony. Quite a group</seg><seg type="columnLine">of artist friends, he found. And he cabled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his father, who, instead of sending him</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, came a-footing on the next boat to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take care of that prodigal son. Wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust him until he'd seen him. The boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">'fessed up then and made a clean breast of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole affair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he wTote me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No, I w'on't tell you what he wrote.

And while he refused to give credence</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a thing which he could not understand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had an odd sense that he and Johnny</seg><seg type="columnLine">Watson were not alone. Unconsciously he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew a bit closer to the fire and to the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was "seeing things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And this here the likeliest trail I ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">set foot down on," said the older man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with nothing but a vague regret in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">even tones.

And now we're in two days of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't finish, breaking off with a long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn, deep breath. His pipe had gone out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he leaned forward, picking up a blazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit of dry pine which he beld to the black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened bowl. Dick Farley noticed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bronzed, lined face was very calm, the eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat wider opened than usual, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers upon the fagot as steady as should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the fingers of a man without nerves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Johnny--" Farley was speaking at last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an effort, keeping his tones as steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his partner's--"j'ou are right when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that there are some things which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't explain.

Fight until</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're in the last ditch, and then go on</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting!" Watson shook his head. "No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ain't the right explanation this trip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've seen them three men today. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen Flash DeVine jerk up his hiad with</seg><seg type="columnLine">86</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little i'unnv sort of twist to the left like</seg><seg type="columnLine">he always used to, and I've seen the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot by Parker's ear. I'd clean forgot them</seg><seg type="columnLine">little things. Dick. No, pard'. There's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">use trying to explain. I got to thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it this noon while you was staking out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horses, and I made a little drawing you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can use it I pass out before we get to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. It's on a dgareet paper, and I poked</seg><seg type="columnLine">it inside old Shaggy's saddle-blanket. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, boy--" standing up, his shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">lilted and squared--"good night. If it hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pens I don't see you any more-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put out his hand suddenly. Young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick Farley gulped down a lump in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat as he gripped Johnny Watson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingers. For a moment they stared into</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other's eyes--then Watson turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">away abruptly and with no other word went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his blankets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg><seg type="columnLine">FORWARD</seg><seg type="columnLine">TT WAS Johnny Watson's voice swear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at old Shaggy that awoke Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farley in the early dawn. Farley stared up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward through the still tree-tops at the gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, his mind groping for the unpleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant something of last night. And when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered he smiled, thinking how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would chaff his partner about his night fears</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his dead men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when he caught a swift glimpse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deep-set eyes under the shaggy gray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprinkled brows, the bantering remarks</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were trooping to the end of his tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">were left unuttered. In a blind sort of way</seg><seg type="columnLine">he realized that the thing which had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Johnny Watson yesterday had not left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Those eyes were looking out upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">death calmly, expectantly, a bit reluctantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not with fear and not with rebellion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farley said nothing as he turned away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wxnt down into the creek-bed to wash his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over their breakfast of coffee, bacon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flapjacks the two men talked lightly of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that, with no mention of last night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When Watson had finished he began speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the day's work into ihe cafion. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">told briefly where they would leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creek in three or four hours, where the)'</seg><seg type="columnLine">would find water for the noon camp, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">more water and grass for the evening camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tonight--we ought to be there by six--</seg><seg type="columnLine">we get over the ridge and into the Devil's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pocket country. There's just one way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out of that country, Dick, and that's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way we're going in. If a man looks for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short cut, if he goes skallyhootmg east or</seg><seg type="columnLine">west, north or south of the place where our</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail is going to cut into the basin there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's a goner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you leave this trail on the way back</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're going to run out of water first thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and your horse is going to break his leg, if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't his neck, the next thing; and then you</seg><seg type="columnLine">die because you can't pick up another water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole. 1 was in that country more'n a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago. There was three of us. Me being</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky in them days, I got out. The others</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't. And I ain't never been back until I</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a whirl at it last month."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning sun had not yet peeped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the steep-walled ravine in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">their course lay when the two men led their</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack-horses out of its shadows, along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher bank upon the right, and ■;;. n the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little bench land there. They moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly, with long swinging strides, and a^</seg><seg type="columnLine">Watson had said, within three or four hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">they left the creek entirely, moved east-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward through a cut in the mountains which</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose steeply against them, and found what</seg><seg type="columnLine">might once have been a trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Conversation had died. Watson was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lead, at times hidden from his compan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion a hundred yards in advance. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the two horses. And in the rear, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain leaping from the talk of last night to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Watson's accounts of the place where ''the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole side of the mountain was rotten with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold," to wondering about this Devil's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pocket, Dick Farley followed silently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They camped a little at noon by a spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Watson had marked upon his map,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rested for a couple of hours. The older</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, unostentatiously and without effort at</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealment, unlimbered the two heavy re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volvers at his belt and looked to them as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man does when he expects he will use them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''The cards ain't played yet, Dick," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "And if it don't come too onexpectcd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're going to give 'em a run for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, old timer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the silent hours of the afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farley strove to keep his partner always in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight, hurrying up the lagging horses, keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">them at Watson's heels. And. although he</seg><seg type="columnLine">still told himself that he did not and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not believe in this senseless superstition, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried all day a forty-five-caliber Colt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond the Law</seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL day they drove steadily into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains. For ahead of them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing which had called to them</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the miles of wilderness, which, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world was young, had drawn men into</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardship, exile and often enough to death--</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft, yellow, crumbling gold! And it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost eight, and dark in the narrow pass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Watson called out and Farley pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the horses to his side and looked on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">site for their camp--"the last camp this side</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strike."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a spring which bubbled out clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cold upon a little flat hardly bigger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barroom at the Eagle Hotel. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">oddly, there was no creek flowing from it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark its whereabouts. For the water ran a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scant ten feet westward and sank into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great fissure in the rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll eat first," said Watson when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men had drunk. "The moon'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">up pretty quick. Then I'll show you some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing--what the Devil's Pocket country</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks like."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day had died slowly. It did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow dark, for with the rising evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze the full moon climbed up through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangle of fir-tops and barren peaks, its strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">white light driving all but the most valiant</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars from the sky. Watson knocked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead ashes out of his pipe and got to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come ahead, Dick. We'll take a look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we're going. Where a good many</seg><seg type="columnLine">men have been--and not many come back."</seg><seg type="columnLine">They climbed from the trail along a spine</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rock to a black spire, rising clear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scanty brush. To the very top of the sloping</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock they worked their cautious way until</seg><seg type="columnLine">their two gaunt bodies stood outlined</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the sky. Here they found footing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and here Watson stood with arm flung out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing. Dick Farley was not unused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thousand moods of the mountain places,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet as his eyes ran along the pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm, and beyond it eagerly, he muttered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled admiration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moon, full, round and yellow, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated clear of the distant ridges and hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">in rich splendor above a long, narrow, twist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing valley, the Devil's Pocket. Trees, hills,</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaks and ravines stood out in the soft light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">black and without detail. The floor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winding valley took upon itself many shift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing shades, a dark silver-gray here where</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a strip of sandy soil, a more som-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber splotch there where the willows followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thin thread of a stream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There she is!" W'atson exclaimed. ''That</seg><seg type="columnLine">thread of willows marks the only creek in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley. It runs from a big spring like</seg><seg type="columnLine">ours here, and the lake drinks it up. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">call the lake 'The Last Drink.' We'll walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen minutes before we get to it. We hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">the southeast shore just about where you see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that little bay with the cliffs coming down</seg><seg type="columnLine">close. There's a trail along the base of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them cliffs; we follow that worse'n six miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">fu'ther. And when we're there, Dickie boy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're right on top of the biggest gold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice broke off sharply, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned his back to it all. Dick heard him</seg><seg type="columnLine">move back down to the trail. With his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with the panorama below him Dick's</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts drew back from the trail and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ore at the end of it and followed the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had found the thing, the precious thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they had so long sought, and who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had turned back for his partner that he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, might have his share.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And again he told himself that his fears</seg><seg type="columnLine">of last night, which had been growing all</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, were groundless, senseless--that John-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ny Watson could not be in danger of death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg><seg type="columnLine">FARLEY MAKES A VOW</seg><seg type="columnLine">T&gt;EFORE he climbed down the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">Watson had gone, Dick Farley again</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned his eyes along the trail which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lead him tomorrow to the Cup of Gold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His wandering fancies built a golden dream</seg><seg type="columnLine">future. Then he turned back and climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly down to the trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fire was dying upon the little rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge where he had built it an hour ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond the camp-fire, where he had flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">his blanket at the base of the cliff, Johnny</seg><seg type="columnLine">Watson was already lying.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he went to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something awoke him; it might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the moon, shining lull in his lace. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled over upon his side, shifted his wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brimmed hat lo shield his lace from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, and still he did not go back to sleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt restless, uneasy--inexplicably un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy. Those confounded things Johnny</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said last night wouldn't leave him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no sound; not a ripple upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the night's silence save the mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mur and trickle of the water. He should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to hear the horses--the chain on old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shaggy's halter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat up. Doing so, he put his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand on the ground beside him, beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny Watson. He felt something damp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spongy, and sticky. He lifted his hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at it in the moonlight. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dark stain. He put it to his nostrils.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Good God!" he cried aloud. ''Johnny!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then when Johnny Watson did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer, he did not need to look. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny Watson was dead--dead at the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his partner who had slept!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young man staggered to his feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared wildly around. Each rock and tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bush stood out clearly in the moonlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its shadow1 flung out very dark and</seg><seg type="columnLine">very distinct. His revolver was rigid in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tense steel of his grip. There was noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, there was no one. And yet, while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept, some one had crept upon his partner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned to where Watson lav. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, as he saw how the man was ly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, the way an arm lay at his side, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other arm flung out, the truth came upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; and without looking at the wound he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that death had not come upon Wat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son while the two men lay side by side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had come while Farley stood alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the top of the cliff staring out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devil's Pocket, dreaming! For as Watson</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay now, so had he lain when Farley camc</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to him. He had been dead when his</seg><seg type="columnLine">partner called to him, saying they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep side by side!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "While I was up on the rock," Farley</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered dully, "they got him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stooped low over the prostrate body</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gently, tenderly, he moved it so that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay face-up. The moonlight showed well</seg><seg type="columnLine">how Johnny Watson's death had found him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the side of his bared neck was a cut such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a broad-bladed knife would make, a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">gash, two inches long. Just one blow Lad</seg><seg type="columnLine">been struck, j\ist one such blow needed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Farley got slowly lo his feet and for a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle stood looking down into the dead man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. And the face of the man who looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the dead eyes was as oddly quiet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''They got you, Johnny," Farley was say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in a voice void of expression, "with me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in calling distance-- Oh, Johnny!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment he stood, his face sunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his two brown hands. And then sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly he whirled about, his head Lifted, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm dung out, shaken with a frenzy of rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My pardner -- you've murdered my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pardner!" he shouted. ''And I'm going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lind you out! I'm going to kill you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he suddenly calmed as he realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was alone in the mountains, a week's</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel from the nearest mining-camp, alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his dead partner. He moved back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ledge and into the shadow, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sat down upon a broken boulder. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">once a thing which he had forgotten swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">back over him--the horses! He had missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noise of their crunching, he had failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear the jingle of old Shaggy's tie-chain!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sprang to his feet and ran down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little clearing where they had tied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two pack-animals. They were gone . I oth</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. He stumbled over one of the pack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddles with its load. There had been no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to take that. But the other, old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shaggy's saddle, was missing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly he made his way back to the lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle ledge where Johnny Watson lay. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sat down upon the bit of boulder, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighting his pipe pulled at it steadily, staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the quiet canon. He could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow tracks until morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH the tirst glint of the new day</seg><seg type="columnLine">he buried johnny Watson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment Dick stood hat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, looking at the little mound of earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had made and piled high with</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones. And then he turned and, walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly, strode back to the spot where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses had been staked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no difficulty in picking up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail. Upon that rugged, rocky mountain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the murderer, if he had taken the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses with him, must have moved east-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and into the Devil's Pocket, or in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction leading southwesterly over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail which Farley and Watson had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">yesterday. He could not have scaled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond the Law</seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs above, he could have made no prog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ress through the dense brush of the deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut ravine below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment Farley hesitated between</seg><seg type="columnLine">going forward toward the little mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley and turning back. Then the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to him that he could hope to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he sought to know by going forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quicker than by swinging back toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southwest. For if the two horses had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastward, it would be easier to pick up their</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail than upon the path which they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut up yesterday. If there should be any</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh tracks leading into the Devil's Pocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would settle it. And not ten minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, having followed the stony trail until</seg><seg type="columnLine">it dipped a little into a bit of soft soil in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollow, he found the tracks--fresh tracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">made by two shod horses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he went back to last night's camp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made himself a small pack of bacon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee and flour; and taking no useless thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no blanket even to interfere with the free</seg><seg type="columnLine">swing of his body, he turned east and struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">out swiftly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He followed the trail for a mile, saw how</seg><seg type="columnLine">it wound in and out, climbing and dipping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">worming slowly toward the pocket. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, when he had been assured that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tw'O horses were ahead of him, he left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail and fought his way due east, up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of a steep bank and to the crest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleak mountains. He remembered Watson</seg><seg type="columnLine">had told him that following the trail they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to go a good fifteen miles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel ten, and now he sought a short-cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">to head off the man he followed. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would pick up the trail again in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hour after hour he trudged on, his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped by tangled brambles in the canons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands torn by the crags over which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to climb toward the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, about the middle of the forenoon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came to the top of the narrow divide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From an out jutting crag he looked down</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the valley before him, seeing again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winding course of the creek, the little lake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steep mountain walls and gorges Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stopped long enough to choose the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must go to make the best time. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then with one long look back toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope where the lone cedar flung its twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches over his partner, he turned again</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastward and plunged down into the steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon, down into the Devil's Pocket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">FARLEY TAKES A TUMBLE</seg><seg type="columnLine">ON THE floor of the Devil's Pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick Farley came upon the trail again</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he had foreseen. Where it ran from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridges across the creek he found tracks. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">drank first and then studied them. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly there came a frown into his eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then a look of pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For there were the tracks of one horse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of a man's boot-heels in the soft wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil--tracks a month old, the tracks which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny Watson had left when he drew out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the valley to find his partner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back and forth Farley moved, stepping</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly by the side of the path, searcidng</seg><seg type="columnLine">long and carefully for the fresh signs to teil</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that two horses had passed here during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night or in the early morning. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not find them. But a moment later, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very edge of the stream, close to the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had just flung himself down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink, he found that another man had lain</seg><seg type="columnLine">there drinking. He saw the prints of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy boots, saw that they had come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the west; that the man had crossed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream here, stepping over the mere thread</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water, and had pushed on toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">northern end of the valley. And the horses?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick had no doubt this was the man he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought. For some reason he had left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses in the hills, hidden in some steep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walled canon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again Farley pushed on, following the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail, seeing now and again the outline of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy boots where the soil was moist</seg><seg type="columnLine">or dusty. In a little he ceased to look for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tracks, excepting at long intervals, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">they led straight ahead, keeping to the path</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the win- grass, straight toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake. At noon he stopped to eat and smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pipe. And then again he pushed on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was tired now, but be gave no respite</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the muscles which had been greatly taxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a night of wakefulness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, a little after noon, he came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lake shore, where the trail ran close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water's edge, and at the base of the dills</seg><seg type="columnLine">which rose a perpendicular twenty feet here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty feet there. And when he had drunk of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dear, cold water and had turned from</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking out across the mile of dimpling</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystal, mountain fringed, he made a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery, a discovery which came very close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to costing him his life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">90</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rising straight up through the clear air</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the cliffs at his side was a thin wisp</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smoke, such as climbs upward from a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle camp-fire. His heart beat quickly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of it. It was back from the cliffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe a quarter of a mile, he judged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There must be a sort of table-land up there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There he would find the man he had fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed. He saw that the tracks had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lake here ahead of him; that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued northward along the shore. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">again he left them, again to make a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut, and began working his way up along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliff-side. Clinging with his fingers to</seg><seg type="columnLine">seams and crevices, driving the toes of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">boots into the cracks which they could find,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he drew painfully, slowly toward the top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was already so close to the edge above</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could almost reach it with a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust up as far as he could reach, with fif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen feet between him and the ground be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. He was straining every muscle, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face tight-pressed to the rocks, reaching up</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the rough hand-hold which just defied</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, when he was startled by a sound com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing clearly to him from below--the unmis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">takable sound of the dip of a paddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw the trap he had blundered into.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he was, he could not turn, could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw a gun from his belt. There he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging to the face of the cliff, a mark to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen from across the lake, with no hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of being overseen by the man who in a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment would drive a canoe around the rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">point a few yards away, who could shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in the back as easily as lift a finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again he strained upward, and at last he</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded in grasping the rock which pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truded from the edge above, and drew him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self up. Then he heard a cry from below, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry as of warning; the rock came away in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand, he clutched wildly to save him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, then plunged headlong, twisting as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell. As his body had struck he felt a swift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven pain through his head, and lost con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness in a black nothingness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Luckily for him the fall had been broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he had twisted his body so that a part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his solid weight struck upon his shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For life was still in him, and came back lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle by little. He tried dizzily to lift his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and could not. But he could turn a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little to the side so that he could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake. There was the canoe, its paddle float-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the water. And coming toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">^t was all so vague; he was so dizzy, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness wavered so like a misty veil in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of his eyes! For a little he would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that his mind was clear yet, that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not wandering. For coming toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was a girl; a girl clad in rough, coarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloth, made into a short skirt and sleeve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less blouse; a girl whose long braided hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">was scarcely a deeper, richer brown than</seg><seg type="columnLine">her bronzed cheeks, as brown as an Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">maid, but with great, fearless gray eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She came swiftly to his side and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon her knees, flinging back the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick braid which had brushed across his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I tried to call, to tell you!" she was say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, her low-toned voice coming to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly through the singing in his ears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">''Are you very badly hurt?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't answer at once, but stared up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the fresh, girlish beauty of her, frowning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to clear the mist from liis eyes, telling him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self that it was impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She leaned closer and put her quick light</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands upon his head. He felt a little shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der run through them. And then, before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could speak, she sprang up, ran to the lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came back to him with water in h-.-r</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hands. She bathed the cut, washed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood away and, ripping a strin of cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the hem of her skirt, tied it about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head in a rude bandage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought--" he began, groping for</seg><seg type="columnLine">words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, yes!" she broke in. "You could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know how crumbling, how treacherous</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the climber those rocks are up there. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to warn you. Are you very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I don't think so," he answered, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowning. And then, "You--where did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed, sitting back from him--her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands clasped about her two knees, her chin</seg><seg type="columnLine">tip-tilted, a glimpse of her round throat tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that the bronze and copper of her col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oring were not racial, that the slender body</seg><seg type="columnLine">was of wonderful white and pink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, you're not badly hurt. Or you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be wondering about other folks!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With an effort of will he drew his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from her and turned them out across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lake. He had come to find a man, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had killed his partner; and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead, this was what he had found. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">Naiad of a creature who was no shy back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods lass, tongue-tied and blushing, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">who looked at him with clear, amused eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond the Law</seg><seg type="columnLine">91</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was Johnny Watson wrong about this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devil's Pocket, after all? He had said that</seg><seg type="columnLine">few men ever came into it; that they never</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back; that they never lived here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then how came this sparkling, radiant</seg><seg type="columnLine">woodland maid here? Where had she come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from now in her light canoe? Where was</seg><seg type="columnLine">she going? Were there others?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly his eyes came back to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't know any one lived here. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then what brought you here?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I came looking for--some one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, realizing that this statement</seg><seg type="columnLine">contradicted the one he had just made, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said by way of explanation:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I meant that I did not know that wom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enfolk ever penetrated so far into the wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derness. Miners, I know, lone prospectors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">get into all corners of the earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And womenfolk?" she challenged him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Are there then any places where men have</seg><seg type="columnLine">led that their womenfolk have not followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He again tried to sit up, but sudden black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness swept upon him and he fell back. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam of amusement went as swiftly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes, which were once more deeply wom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anly, intensely feminine and soft. Her cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand was upon his forehead, pushing back</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tangled hair, smoothing it; and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, cooing, tender, came to him like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper out of a dream:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are hurt, badly hurt! Don't try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move. Just rest; be very still."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more she sprang up and ran to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake shore to bring water in his hat. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet his forehead, readjusted the bandage</seg><seg type="columnLine">and let a little trickle of water run upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists. In a moment he opened his eyes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look up at her, forcing a smile to meet her</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious gaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you tell me," she said softly, "where</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are hurt? You can't move?"'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 111 try again in a minute. It's my whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, the right side." He glanced down to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward his hand. "I think the wrist is broken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got it caught under me as I fell. I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">move it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is swollen already," she told him after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brief inspection. "Poor fellow, how it</seg><seg type="columnLine">must hurt!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then as professionally as a trained nurse</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have done it she moved her hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">down along his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where does it hurt most?" she queried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes upon his. "The shoulder, isn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Just a bad bruise, I think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope so. Now, do you think that after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a while, when you have rested a little, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can manage to walk? Just a few feet?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes. But where'Ll I walk to?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just to the boat. And 1 11 take you the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of the way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the rest of the way?" he asked curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are a mighty inquisitive creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a patient!" she smiled. "Where do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose? Home, of course!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GIRL FROM THE LAKE</seg><seg type="columnLine">DICK rested for a long time. Then lean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upon the girl's firm shoulder, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to his feet and moved slowly with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the boat. When he had sunk in a hud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dled heap in the narrow craft, his pulses</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating wildly, his head whirling, he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to realize he had a great deal besides a scalp</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound and a broken wrist to reckon with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a swift flash of a glance at his white</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips and the little drops upon his forehead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl stepped into the boat, took up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddle and pushed out into the lake. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">under her strong hands the canoe shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the water, headed for the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the lake and for a little cove, cliU-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick half slept as the canoe sped on and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. Finally he roused as they rounded a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocky point, flashed by a Little green cove</seg><seg type="columnLine">into which a narrow spray of water fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the clifFs above, skirted a dense pine</seg><seg type="columnLine">grove, and turned suddenly into a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny bay, sandy-beached. The canoe, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender nose thrust into the pebbles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">white sand, held there, swaying gently. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore Farley could move, the girl was out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing in the shallow water, her left hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadying the boat while her right reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to help him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you feel strong enough, it's only a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle way, and you will rest better."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ashamed of his weakness in the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her confident young strength, he got to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. Already it was a harder thing for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stand than it had been ten minutes ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His right shoulder, side and arm were utter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly useless. His leg. when he put a little of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his weight upon it, pained him so that with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lip caught sharply between his teeth it</seg><seg type="columnLine">9-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost him much to keep back a cry of agony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in the end, leaning upon her, her arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight about him, he got into the water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the strip of sand. Looking anxiously for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of camp, he saw ahead only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick grove of pine and fir like the one they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed, and the sheer clilTs beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think," she was saying to him, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you rest again you will only be the stiffer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorer for it. Can you manage to walk a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle further?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded. And now he staggered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his guide and into the trees. And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last she stopped he again looked up, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecting to see the camp. Instead, he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had brought up at the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the level strip with the cliff-wall in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're going up there," she answered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled look in his eyes. "It isn't as hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it looks. Can you go a little further?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded again painfully. So again</seg><seg type="columnLine">they moved on, ten feet along the cliffs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, unexpectedly for him, upon a great,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently slanting cut in the rocks, into which</seg><seg type="columnLine">bits of stone had been flung so as to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">rude, rough steps. It was harder now, slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er; for he had to lift, his left foot each time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while she helped relieve the weight upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other, and wearily pull himself up. Ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes dragged by before they had climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twenty feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon the top was a plateau perhaps a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile long, broken with trees and boulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred yards wide. The fringe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees and ragged cliffs upon the side toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lake hid the table-land completely from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that direction. And, set between two gnarl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed cedars, at the very edge of a dense bit c&gt;f</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest ,where it ran out from the sea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">verdure like a cape, was a low, rambling log</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin, a thin spiral of smoke winding up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its stone chimney. Here was "home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cabin had all the signs of age, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored by many Winters, a vine a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">years old climbing over it. And Johnny</seg><seg type="columnLine">Watson, who had known the Devil's Pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a quarter of a century, had said that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">man ever lived here!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Dick Farley was in little mood for</seg><seg type="columnLine">specu lation. He stumbled on, conscious on ly</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dizzy nausea which drove even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain of his hurt side into a dim, faraway</seg><seg type="columnLine">background. After an endless groping</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a thickening fog he knew that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stepped from the sunlight into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade; felt rough boards under his boots;</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that two arms, not ju*&gt;t one, were tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his body; knew wiih a grateful, long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn sobbing breath that he was lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon blankets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was dusk in the cabin--twilight fra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grant with the spicy odors dropping down</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the grove--when he found himself at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first groping for reality in a confused chaos</seg><seg type="columnLine">of emotions and then gradually coming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">full understanding. It was a great, low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walled room, a rectangle of light marking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, two squares showing him the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows and a deep-mouthed fireplace crack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling with a newly lighted fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Across the room from his bunk were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy little table and rough chair. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes went slowly to the floor--over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">squared saplings which went to make it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">across a bearskin, and to another door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller, lower than the other, leading into</seg><seg type="columnLine">another room. He tried to lift himself up&gt;on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his elbow, and fell back stabbed by ihe</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp pain in his shoulder. And then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned his head quickly toward the narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. Then he had heard a step.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She came swiftly to him, looking down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him with her great eyes filled witli con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cern. When she saw the look in his she</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled, and sitting down upon the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bed put her hand upon his forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are better," her rich voice was say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in a matter-of-fact way. "You're not</seg><seg type="columnLine">so feverish, and you know where you are,</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Much better." He called up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted smile to meet hers. And then, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been an awful nuisance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mustn't say such things-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he insisted, looking steadily at her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you hadn't happened along--if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't found me then, or soon--do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what would have happened to me?</seg><seg type="columnLine">If I hadn't died from my fall and exposure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd have died pretty soon from starvation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you know that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know," she retorted with great mock</seg><seg type="columnLine">severity, "that this is my case; you're my</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient, and I'm the doctor and the nurse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that you're talking, whUe I believe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper thing for people who are sick is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie still. Also, you're not going to die of</seg><seg type="columnLine">starvation now. When I heard you stir, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just making some soup for you. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm the cook, too!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she had come back with a smoking</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowl of broth, she set the thing down upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor for a moment while she insisted on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond the Law</seg><seg type="columnLine">93</seg><seg type="columnLine">propping him up with pillows. She shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head at him when he opened his lips to</seg><seg type="columnLine">protest, and thrust a spoonful of the soup</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them by way of further silencing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good?" she demanded, when she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">set the empty bowl down on the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And now, do you know I am afraid that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have about reached the end of my medical</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge! I've forbidden you to talk, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've fed you some broth. What next?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There'll be nothing next. I'm going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be all right soon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course you are! But we must do</seg><seg type="columnLine">something for your poor, hurt side. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">some liniment-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Just the thing," he assured her. "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">give myself a good rubbing-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You are very stupid," she frowned at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "You will do nothing of the sort.

Isn't it glorious?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Dick, to whom there had come a sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den fear, made no answer, frowning as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay back staring up at the rough rafters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg><seg type="columnLine">VIRGINIA GETS A LETTER</seg><seg type="columnLine">npHE night dragged by, bringing little</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep to Dick Farley, and Virginia</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dalton's father did not return. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">longest night Dick had ever known. Hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">after hour he sat propped up against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, the pillows behind him. and smoked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring out through the open door at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows the moon made. They were deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">black shadows, and his spirit was caught in</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, strangely troubled. But at last, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tardy day was breaking, the spark in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pipe-bowl died and he slipped down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pillows and slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he awoke, the sun was flinging its</seg><seg type="columnLine">light through the tree-tops into the cabin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nature's was a soft mood this morning--</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling, fragrant, audible with many low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmonious woodland notes.

He watched the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">door expectantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In a little while she came in, her voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">hushed, walking tiptoe not to wake him, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rod in one hand, a string of lake-trou t swing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the other.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not lonely because no one had taught</seg><seg type="columnLine">her the word, because she had known no</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence but this.

His right side</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very nearly useless to him, the shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower ribs and leg being sore and stiff; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a cane which she cut for him from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sapling in the grove he was able to hobble</seg><seg type="columnLine">around slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He realized, as he worked his way un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily to the door, that it would be many</seg><seg type="columnLine">days before he could take up the trail which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had vowed over his dead partner's body</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow until he found its end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning passed, and they had lunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">together out under the trees at the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grove. Still Dalton had not come in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the girl seemed in no way surprised,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying lightly that her father often was gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day or so without warning, that perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had found and was following the tracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a bear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am going for my mail," she told him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing at his wonder. "Do you feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong enough to come with me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mail?" he demanded incredulously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes! There may be a letter from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daddy. The post-office is over yonder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the lake.

Leaving him here for a little,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she disappeared into the trees and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back presently, carrying the light boat upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helping him to get into it, she pushed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shore, jumped in and paddled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the water, heading straight for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">western side a half-mile away. Upon a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle beach there, sandy and strewn with white</seg><seg type="columnLine">pebbles she grounded the canoe; and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word to him to wait while she asked for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter, hurried to a big rock, flat-topped?</seg><seg type="columnLine">set back a little from the water's edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turning so that he could see what she did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she tossed toward him live pebbles which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had picked up from the rock.

"Of course there was!

Yet, where should he go? To pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the trail which he had followed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">margin of the lake, and to follow it--where?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Would it bring him, after miles of winding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">96</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the cabin perched upon the table-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land? Would he iind at the end of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail James Dalton, her father? Where was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dalton now? Why had he gone away so</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly? Why had he said to her the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other day, the day before Johnny was</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed, that at last they could go back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world which so long ago he had left be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him? Had he killed Johnny Watson?</seg><seg type="columnLine">If not he, who then?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Dalton had killed Watson, then Farley</seg><seg type="columnLine">must kill Dalton. There was no other way;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there could be no other way. He must kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">the father of the girl who had brought him</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and cared for him, who had saved him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from dying alone and miserable--must kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">her "dear old Daddy," whom she loved so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much, who had always been so good to her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was all that she had in the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And to stay here made matters worse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To linger on in the home of the man whom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, he was to kill; to listen to the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuous, happy voice of the daughter; to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow to see how wonderful a thing Nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">had built of this child of the wildwood; to</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel that day by day they were being drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer together, that they were crossing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">frontier which in a little they could not re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If her father is the man who did it, have</seg><seg type="columnLine">I the right to take her father from her?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he muttered. And again, "Has the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who killed Johnny Watson a right lo live?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So those five days were short days, fleeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">so swiftly for man and maid, filled with sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shine and the girl's soft laughter and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague promise of life. And the nights were</seg><seg type="columnLine">long nights for the man; crowded with ugly</seg><seg type="columnLine">images, torn with doubts, beset with</seg><seg type="columnLine">threats of the future, thronged with ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions to which he could find no answer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now there was nothing to do but to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was no waiting, no staying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the path into which their feet were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandering, Dick Farley's and Virginia Dal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's. It was the old, old story of a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a maid. And with the first gTeat throb</seg><seg type="columnLine">of understanding in the man's heart (here</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, too, a contraction and a pain, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore himself abruptly from the girl's pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence and went to stand frowning toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountains into which Dalton had gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And her eyes, following him, were filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tender light which was new to them, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips parted in a half-smile, her breast rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">and falling rapidly. For into her heart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, had come the throb, but not the pain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knowledge he had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the sixth day. They had been t&lt;»-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether so much; had talked of self and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other so frankly; had been so lost to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world and drawn close to each other in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solitude of the still mountains; had come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find a new peace and contentment as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were silent together watching the coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dawn, the passing of the day, the slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">voyages of the moon through clouds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars; had been so all-sufficient each to each</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the short five days seemed like long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bursting years when they looked back upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. It was only natural that the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was happening with them should</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, upon the morning of the sixth day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day which was to bring Dalton home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their talk had died down suddenly. Farley</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen into an abrupt silence, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">refusing to come back to hers. .And in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little the girl's mood followed his, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a faint trouble in her eyes she moved about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin, as silent as he. The forenoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed; they lunched, with now and then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitful burst of conversation which ended</seg><seg type="columnLine">wretchedly, forced and unnatural, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon wore on. It was nearly dusk</seg><seg type="columnLine">when James Dalton came home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a very big man, tall, heavy, broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shoulder, and very dark; with sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">black eyes under bushy brows, black hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beard shot with gray. He came upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from the lake, walking swiftly, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle caught up under his arm. The girl was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting upon the doorstep, Farley upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock a few feet away. Dalton's eyes weDt</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly from the young man to his daughter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">very keen, with a glint of surprise in them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Daddy!" the girl cried, running to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, throwing her two arms about his neck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So you have finally got tired of roving and</seg><seg type="columnLine">have come back, have you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ran an arm about her, and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no reply to her bantering, demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who is that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Farley was on his feet now, missing noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that the big man said, no gesture he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My name is Farley," he returned for</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. "A miner. I came into this coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try prospecting. Had a bad fall, and your</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter took care of me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Prospecting?" Dalton laughed unpleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">antly. "Don't you know, young man, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond the Law</seg><seg type="columnLine">97</seg><seg type="columnLine">this country, every foot of it, has been gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and over during the last twenty years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nothing ever found? Prospecting!''</seg><seg type="columnLine">He strode by Farley towards the cabin, mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering, "So they come right under our nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and prospect!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">SAS HE went, Farley's eager eyes saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hunting-knife which swung un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scabbarded from his belt--a knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than usually broad-bladed; and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart sank. Little as he liked the looks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this man, he had prayed that he prove to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">innocent of Johnny Watson's blood. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door Dalton stopped and swung about, look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing steadily, deep into Farley's eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When did you get here?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly. "How long have you been here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I came five days ago--the day you</seg><seg type="columnLine">left."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where did you come from?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From the coast. Then from Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sisters and the Yellow Queen country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I've been prospecting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What brought you in here? Don't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that this country has been combed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a hundred times--that there is nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believed," Farley retorted quietly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that there was gold in these mountains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since my fall I have not had a chance to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. So I haven't learned yet that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Virginia Dalton had stepped a little from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her father's side, and now stood with trou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled face looking from one man to the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was an atmosphere of distrust, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of open hostility, and she could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dalton turned slowly from Farley to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl. As he moved the iron rigidity left his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, the cold glint passed from his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was wonderful how the man's whole ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression softened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come here, Virginia," he said gently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I want to talk with you a little. Mr. Far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley," with grave courtesy, "will pardon us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Farley bowed. Dalton, with his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his daughter, entered the cabin, clo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sing the door behind them, leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">younger man alone with his doubts, his sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picions, his fears. Their voices came to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">confused, indistinct. He supposed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">father was asking all about this intruder</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their quiet Eden; whence he had come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what she knew of him and his purposes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1- mally the door opened and Dalton stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the threshold looking steadily out at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I trust that you will overlook my rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">scant courtesy in greeting a guest, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farley." The tone was open, frank, pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant. "I am afraid that living a sort of exile</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wilderness so many years has made</seg><seg type="columnLine">me forget the social usages. Will you come</seg><seg type="columnLine">in for a pipe? We can talk things over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think," Farley replied, his eyes running</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the broad form so nearly filling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway to the form of the slender girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing within the room, "that I have al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready allowed myself to become a nuisance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Dalton has been very kind to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But for her, I imagine, I should never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">come so easily out of my accident. Now I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am able to be about again, and I think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll take up the thing which brought me</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. I have some work to do. But--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two men's eyes meeting again, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">studying the other--"I shall see you again</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I leave the valley for good. And' --</seg><seg type="columnLine">with slow significance--"I shall tell you all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about what brought me here before I go</seg><seg type="columnLine">next time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lifted his hat to the girl, said a brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of thanks and of good-by, and limped</seg><seg type="columnLine">away toward the lake. And his heart was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very bitter as he went, and there was little</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope in him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIE</seg><seg type="columnLine">FARLEY FOLLOWS THE TRATL</seg><seg type="columnLine">/"\UT of the few scanty details which</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to him to have any bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the thing he sought to know, Dick Far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley strove to piece together a chain of evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence which his brain could accept as point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the guilt or to the innocence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">James Dalton. As he drew slowly away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the cabin and toward the cliffs which</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell away to the lake, he arranged in mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">these things in a sort of logical order:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> i.	There must have been some strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive for the killing of his partner. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dalton's knife driven by Dalton's powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand had caused Johnny Watson's death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what motive could have moved Dalton to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the act?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This point he considered a long time. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was possible that these two men had known</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other years before; that they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies; that revenge had steeled the mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derer's arm. But it did not seem probable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">98</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was something a great deal mitre</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Could it not be that Dalton, although he</seg><seg type="columnLine">denied the presence of gold in the valley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stumbled upon the same streak which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny had found a month ago--the Cup</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Gold? That he had discovered Johnny's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks, had foreseen that he would return</seg><seg type="columnLine">with pack-horses, and had killed him rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that an outsider should come into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley and steal "his" gold? But why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, had he not killed Johnny's partner as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 2.	The crime had been committed with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife, unusually broad-bladed. Dalton</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore sue h a knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 3.	Something had made Dalton tell his</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter upon the day of the murder that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were going to leave the Devil's Pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">and go back into the world. What was it?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Did it have any bearing on the case? If not,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was one of those odd coincidences which</seg><seg type="columnLine">occur sometimes, and Farley did not believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much in coincidences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 4.	The man who had committed the crime</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stolen the two horses, and had hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">them somewhere in the mountains to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southwest of the valley. Dalton had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">away into these same mountains and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been gone five days. Why had he gone?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had not had time to reach any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlements; he had brought back no sugar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no cloth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 5.	Dalton had lived many years in a se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusion which was very like hiding. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked the part of a man who had never had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sick day in his life. He was not here be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause the doctors had sent him. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man of culture, a man who had traveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seen much of the world. He loved his</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter. Why, then, had he suffered this</seg><seg type="columnLine">long exile? Why had he made her endure</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These matters rose above other consider-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ations in Farley's mind. And in the end he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw no way of arriving at any kind of cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty until he had gone back to pkk up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old trail; until he had found the horses;</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he had seen if Dalton's tracks led to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and back from them to the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped for a moment at the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs and turned to look back at the cabin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw the girl standing there alone, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes following him; saw her hand go up</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly as he turned to wave to her; re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered what she had done for him; saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">again the clean heart and budding woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul which she had not thought of hiding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not known huw to hide from him. Lift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his hat to her, he hurried down the clifTs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and out of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It would kill her," he muttered. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, his eyes grown suddenly hard as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to shut her out of his mind: "Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, Johnny, old pardner. It's all in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards, and we'll play it out. If he did it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'll pay for it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when night came to him in the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mountains and he sat brooding over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his camp-fire he could not drive her out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wandering thoughts. He saw justice on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand, and loyalty to one's partner; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other he saw the face of a girl who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to be happy, or broken upon her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lirst great sorrow--and it would be his act</seg><seg type="columnLine">to decide her life for her. He bowed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head in his two hands, caught powerless in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the irony of fate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a week Dick Farley sought, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">without rest to body and brain, tu work • ut</seg><seg type="columnLine">the puzzle which had been set before him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had gone almost back to where he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried Johnny Watson before he found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail of the two stolen horses. This he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed away from the valley through</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow' canons, over rocky passes, for two</seg><seg type="columnLine">days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he had known from his partner's</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, there was little water here. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought more than once that he we-uld be</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven back to replenish the bottle he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried with him. But the man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven the horses here had known the coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try; and following the trail, turning with it</seg><seg type="columnLine">north or south of its general course, 1- arlev</seg><seg type="columnLine">found enough water in small springs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender streams to keep the life in him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make his progress possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortunately the country was tilled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">small game, the quail, hare, grouse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">squirrels having more curiosity than fear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming close enough for him to kill with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolvers what he required for food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came at last upon the two horses in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, steep-walled valley set like a cup in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountains. Here there was much rich,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry grass, and a narrow stream wandering</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it. With little trouble he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pack-saddle where it had been thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a clump of manzanitas. Remembering</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time the map which Johnny</seg><seg type="columnLine">had told him was hidden in a saddle-blanket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found it readily. With a swift, cursory</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance at it he put it into his pocket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond the Law</seg><seg type="columnLine">99</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To get the horses where they were left</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the main trail," he muttered to himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"to bring them here, then to go back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake would take a man just about five days</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the time that Dalton was gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was another point, a further link in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chain; but, like the other links, it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong enough to bear the burden of cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty. He must find other tracks--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks the man had made when he left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses here. He must follow them. If they</seg><seg type="columnLine">led straight back over the hills to the lake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would know. And he had little doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would find them, and that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would carry him once more to the Dalton</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">AND now came the slowest, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardest of his work. To follow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail left by two horses was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratively simple. To track a man over</seg><seg type="columnLine">these mountains, across hard ground and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry gully, was another matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was certain that the man Dalton, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">a possible other, had not gone back over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same trail. It was devious, turning aside for</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep canons which a horse could not climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">but which a man could, full of many twists</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turns. A man on foot would take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorter way. And until he knew beyond a</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt that that man had been Virginia Dal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's father, he could not tell whether to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look upon the eastern edge of the tiny val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley for it, upon the western, northern or</seg><seg type="columnLine">southern. But believing more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the trail would lead toward the east,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked where he thought to find it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in an hour after finding the horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">he picked up the other trail--the tracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">made by the man who had brought them</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. He saw the deep print of a boot-heel</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the moist soil along the creek, found an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other track a few feet farther on, then an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other--all leading toward the east--toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devil s Pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A glance at the encircling hills showed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the tracks must lead, where there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little nature-made pass, leading over their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cre.'.ts which a man might follow; and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pushed ahead in that direction, positive</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would find the tracks there if there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were anv loose soil to keep them. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily that he must leave the horses where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were for the present.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It took him another hour to climb up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">e gap in the hills. The darkness was corn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mg on, but there was light enough for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see that the same heavy boots which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left their imprint in the soft dirt by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creek had passed here. He had done a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">day's work; his side was paining him again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night was very near. So he built his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire here and made his bed of fir-boughs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the first light of the dawn he break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fasted and moved on once more toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devil's Pocket. Everywhere underfoot was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thick mat of pine-needles, upon which</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man's foot would leave no sign. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural pass in which he had camped led</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight on and into a canon upon the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the little ridge; and where the soil</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sifted down from the canon sides to lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there among the rocks strewing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom of the ravine was the imprint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the heavy boots again. Only infre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently stopping to assure himself that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not going wrong, he made what haste</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could back toward the lake. And he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone perhaps five miles before he came upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a discovery which caused him to stop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowning, wondering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was in a small clearing, sandy-floored.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tracks were here, still leading east.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But no longer was there the single trail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here, plainly outlined, were the prints left</seg><seg type="columnLine">by two men. They were side by side, alike</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh, a very few days old.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Farley had just come down a long rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope into the clearing, and did not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the second man's path had met the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first. There was little use in going back, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to find out. He sat down, filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pipe and tried to make out the meaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this new complication. Who was this</seg><seg type="columnLine">second man? Where had he come from?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where was he going? Had he been with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dalton, or had he been trailing Dalton, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">had Dalton been following him?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the end he could not see that the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks made any great difference. If the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail he was following led on to the lake, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dalton's cabin, the thing was clear enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down the long slope of the mountainside</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the clearing, into the rocky bed of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravine, the only logical way for a man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow, and out into a miniature valley be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, he continued without looking for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks which he knew the hard, broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground would not show had he looked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was two miles before he again found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boot-tracks in a bit of soft soil. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">here again had one man, only one man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed. The other, the second, had evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently turned aside across the rock-strewn</seg><seg type="columnLine">IOO</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the mountain--had gone on his way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospecting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IX</seg><seg type="columnLine">FARLEY PLNDS HIS MAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">TT WAS very quiet in Dalton's cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Were it not for the figures which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickering firelight found out uncertainly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">casting their grotesque wavering shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the floor and wall, one would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that there was no living thing there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dalton sat hunched forward in his chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">--his elbows on his knees, his big hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">knotted together, his eyes on the coals</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered across the stone hearth. Near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, standing erect, his eyes upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">still figure, his whole attitude that of a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting, was Dick Farley. Now and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned his head a little and looked sharp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly over his shoulder into the darkness out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, as if he feared interruption.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So," said Dalton after a long silence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no part of his body moving save his lips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">liis voice without expression. "So you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pardner. 1 was afraid so, all along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes." Farley's answer was as quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressionless. "I was his pardner.0</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dalton stirred in his chair. Farley's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body lost none of its rigid motionlessness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his hand, the right one, dropped quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his hip. Dalton had reached for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe, filled it and lighted it with a coal</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he picked up in his fingers. Farley's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand remained upon the grip of his revolver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sorry, mighty sorry," Dalton went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, without looking up. And then, "Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there anything else you want to say?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess I've said about all. I camc</seg><seg type="columnLine">into this country with johnny--my pard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner. We were looking for gold. YVe were</seg><seg type="columnLine">interfering with no man. Johnny is dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">murdered. It wasn't even a fair fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who did it? I haven't jumped at con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusions. I probably would if it hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">been for--" he hesitated a fraction of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second, during which for the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dalton glanced up swiftly at him--"for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Dalton. I wanted to be sure. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracked you from one end of the trail to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, to the cabin here. I think it's pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear. So I came here to accuse you of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the first time he had spoken so</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly. But the two men had understood</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other without this putting a name lo</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> •I don't like that word, Farley," ballon</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut in, his voice its expressionless as before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his form as still. "You tall him Johnny?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, men's names change often enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in this country for us not to quibble.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I suppose he's carried a good man) names</seg><seg type="columnLine">since I saw him last."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You knew him? A long time ago?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. I hadn't seen him for over fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, until-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't finish. Instead, he said after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And being his pardner, you are going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to square things for him; to be judge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jury and hangman; to kill the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed him? Well, every man is his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">court out here, where we are so far beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the law. And when a man is dead it is up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his pardner. Thai is the way you feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," Dalton laughed mirthlessly. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">are beyond the law here--we are not bev ond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reach of justice. Justice--or revenge?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is hard to see one for the other, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times! You want to kill me, then?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There is no use talking that way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dalton," Farley frowned. "You have lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">here too long; you know too well what is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the result of the thing which you have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">--you don't deny it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will it make any difference what I;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know'. I don't think so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are going to try to kill me," Dalton</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued. "That won't help your dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend much, but you'll do it just the same.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have no desire to be killed by you or bv</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other man. But soon there is going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be another dead man here--you or I.J And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Virginia! I wonder what she is going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. That complicates mailers, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't in any great degree alter them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">does it?

Now, if you will listen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray story. ' Won't you sit down?" Farley</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped to the chair at his side. "I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble in Richmond, where our home was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I killed a man. Why, doesn't matter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Unfortunately for me, I killed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the presence of another who saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing done. That other man was your</seg><seg type="columnLine">pardner. He hated me as cordially as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated him. In any court in the world he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have sworn that it was cold-blooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder, and his word would have hanged</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He would have lied when he said it, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have sworn it just the same. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was, I had to run for it. Virginia was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little baby, six months old. Her mother--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice growing very hard--"was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong. She died. I wasn't with her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was being hounded from one place to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other; and the man who hounded me when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole thing would have been dropped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who was the real murderer of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife, was the man who made it necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me to run before what men call justice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did go back and get the baby. Then w^e</seg><seg type="columnLine">came here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Again and again, as the years rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">around, I got word from the world; each</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to hear that what the world had for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten was not forgotten by the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not satisfied in my exile, my loss of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the things which counted. He was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for me, he still would stop only</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he saw me given over into the hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's hands. A few days ago I found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had penetrated into this wilderness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His prospector's outfit did not mislead me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was looking for me. I was glad of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I told Virginia that soon we were going</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the world from which we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden so many long years. I killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You murdered him," replied Farley cold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">y°U glven him a cilance-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'How do you know I murdered him?</seg><seg type="columnLine">fhancer- y°" "°W 1 didn't	a</seg><seg type="columnLine">„nZhtL,h°le i?,hi,s thro*t-death</seg><seg type="columnLine">upoa him suddenly, unexpected!}'.

You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait until tomorrow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'll wait."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Farley got to his feet.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the door behind him, and strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly away into the darkness. Of no</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind to sleep, he built a little fire of dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">twigs and pine-cones, and sitting upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen log stared into the flames moodily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">HE HAD sat there, motionless, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">five minutes when something im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled him to look up. Standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few feet from him, just witiiout the circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his firelight, was Virginia Dalton. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose quickly, took a step forward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped. He did not at once speak, wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you have come back?" she said gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tly. "I have missed you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I have come back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you found what vou wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I found what I was looking for. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that I wanted to find just that," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended bitterly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She came slowly toward him until she</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in the firelight, so near that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have put out his hand and touched her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw the brown arms reflecting the waver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fire, the dark braids, the full, round</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat, her eyes even, deep and earnest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And something he glimpsed in their quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths sent a quick pain to his heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," she answered as if he had spoken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I heard. I listened outside. I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">every word." She broke off, only her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands clasping each other tightly showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that the calmness of her still figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">was forced over a tumult within. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">so," she barely whispered after a little, "you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have come back to kill dear old Daddy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved back, away from her, back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the quiet misery in her eyes, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">no answer. And she came with him, step</seg><seg type="columnLine">102</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">by step until he had stopped, and put her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand upon his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have come back/' she repeated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same lifeless tone, so different from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad note which he hud so often thrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">through her voice, "to kill Daddy. Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You heard," he muttered heavily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. He killed your pardner." She</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivered and the hand upon his arm grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">very tense. "So you want to kill him. Will</seg><seg type="columnLine">that do any good? It will make me very</seg><seg type="columnLine">miserable. It will take my father away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from me--all I have. And will it do your</seg><seg type="columnLine">pardner any good?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why did you come?" he cried out</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiercely. "You don't understand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't I understand?" She smiled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him--a wistful, wan little smile which hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">him more than if she had cried out aloud.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I understand this much: tliat in all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world 1 have but Daddy, and that he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been always so good to me, and that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to take him away from me!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I understand that you want to kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">him because he killed your pardner, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it won't do any good for you to kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; it won't bring your pardner back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, it won't make him rest any easier. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand that these things are not for</seg><seg type="columnLine">men to do, but for God. God sees better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than we can see, and clearer and deeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into our hearts. And He would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">do what you are going to do. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not take my Daddy away from me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he made no answer, finding no</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer to make, she stood silent a little,</seg><seg type="columnLine">letting her head sink forward despairingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then, again lifting her eyes to his,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lips, her chin quivering as she strove</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make her faltering voice firm:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you sec that you will make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem almost as if I had killed him, myself?</seg><seg type="columnLine">l?or if I had not brought you to the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">you would never have found it, maybe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If I had not thought you were a friend and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought you there, maybe you would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have lived!

Again, groaning aloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had drawn back from her, and she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to his side once more, had again lain</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hand softly upon his arm. "And don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see something else? We were growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be such friends, you and I, Dick Farley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Didn't I read right the things which you</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not say that day you went away, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things which were in your heart? Didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see the things in my heart, too? Didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fell her hand tremble pitifully, saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the anguish written upon her young fate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We were going to be good friends--oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such good friends! And now"--with a dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">sob as she put her face in her two hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook from head to foot with the storm in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her bosom--"and now you want to end it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, and to kill him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a blind moment he fought hard with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing which she had thought was friend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. And then, seeing her swaying there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing her mute misery, he put out his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drew her close to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Friends!" he cried, his voice harsh in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her ears, like the voice of a man in anger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Friends! Can't you see that I love you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">love you as a man can not love his friends--</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he can love only the one woman in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She lifted her face quickly to his, md</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the tears glistening upon Iv.-r • heeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could see a new look, a look of gladness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!" she whispered, drawing closer in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the embrace of his arms. "I am glad:</seg><seg type="columnLine">And you won't hurt him now; you cani.;"</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a little he held her to him. tightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed, as if defying the world to t.i'-.e her</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from him. And then slowly his arrr.s</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosened and dropped to his side. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">again he had seen Johnny Watson's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring up at him through the faint light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dawn; again he realised that because</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was Dalton's daughter. Dalton was none</seg><seg type="columnLine">the less his partner's murderer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?'' she asked softly. "Isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all right now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is all wrong, Virginia, dear," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitterly. "And this only makes it more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more wrong. Don't ask me anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. Only go back to your father and let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me think things over. 1--" his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hard and steady-- "I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is going to happen. I don't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I am going to kill him. W ill you kiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">me good night, dear?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He watched her as she went slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the night, watched her as for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment she stood in the dim rectangle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light made by the open door, and then bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the darkness and the shooting flames</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his camp-fire about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Johnny!" he muttered when at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was but a dead pile of ashes where</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fire had been. "If 1 don't kill him if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond the Law</seg><seg type="columnLine">103</seg><seg type="columnLine">he kills me instead--it will be all right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't it, Johnny?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER X</seg><seg type="columnLine">JUSTICE</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE day had come, and Dick Farley</seg><seg type="columnLine">was firm and calm in his determina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. But the thing which the day was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring need not come yet. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">call for haste, while there was an urge deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in his soul to spend this day alone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned his back upon the cabin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went, walking rapidly, down to the quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore of the lake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Until now he had scarcely more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at Johnny Watson's map. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cup of Gold had seemed the small thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">which gold is always when come the great,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vital issues of life. But now it was dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent; now he could see a reason in going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on over Johnny's trail, in finding the hill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side that was "rotten with gold." This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something which must be done before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked into Dalton's eyes again--for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A long, curving line along one side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown cigarette paper was marked in pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully small letters, "East Shore." A dotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">line marked "Trail" ran along this. "High</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cliffs" indicated the spot where Farley had</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempted to climb up to the plateau,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had fallen. The doited line ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">on by this, close to the lake shore, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked "2 mile.'' Then there was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">triangle with the words "Big White Rock."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here the dotted line swerved at right angles</seg><seg type="columnLine">--to the east--"200 paces." Here was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, "Canon." That was all upon one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the paper. Upon the other, written</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly was:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Enter mouth canon. Go straight about</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred yards. Climb dead pine-tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaning against east bank. Straight up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of ridge. Follow ledge to clilT. Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">along bottom of cliff." And that was all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Farley put the paper again in his pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned north along the lake shore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had perhaps two miles and a half, may-</seg><seg type="columnLine">be three miles, to go, and be was growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to see this mine which his partner</seg><seg type="columnLine">had discovered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was a simple matter to follow the trail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a natural path at the lake's edge, kept open</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the deer and other woodland animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">that came down lo drink or browse upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long grass here. And before he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered more than half of the two miles he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the "big white rock" which Johnny</seg><seg type="columnLine">had marked for him, close to the water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising straight up from the level floor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here, with a glance at his map to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that he was right, he turned eastward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">counting his steps. He had stepped off one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and twenty-five when he stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowning. For nowhere were the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains far from the lake, and already he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered a canon. And Johnny's map had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said two hundred paces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Johnny wouldn't make a mistake like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that," he told himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, again counting, he moved on and</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the canon until he had counted another</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy-five paces. Then he understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here, cut into the wall of this canon, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second, a narrower, steeper-walled ravine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently the one Johnny had had in mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he said, "Enter mouth of canon/'</seg><seg type="columnLine">The general trend of this one was north and</seg><seg type="columnLine">south. He pushed on into it, estimating</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly the five hundred yards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, with a little quickening of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulses, he saw the dead pine-tree. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen, and now, with its roots half torn out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rocky soil, lay sprawled against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastern bank of the canon at an angle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">about forty-five degrees. The banks here</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so steep, rising fifty feet above him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a man would have had a hard time</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing them. But the fallen tree was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once a pointer to the Cup of Gold and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladder to reach it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up on the top of the bank he found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge, and working his way slowly along</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he came to the long line of cliffs which</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing above made the side of the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain look like a giants stairway. And now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">liis heart beating with the exertion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle upward and with the eagerness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickened anticipation which comes to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miner at a time like this, no matter what</seg><seg type="columnLine">face the day wears, he stopped and let his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes rove along the bottom of the cliff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in a moment he saw what he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, and hurried forward. There were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks of a pick in the crumbling bank, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor Johnny!" he muttered. "Poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Johnny! To feel his pick sink into this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have it in his hands--and never to really</seg><seg type="columnLine">work the greatest mine this country ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">104</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For here, showing so that a novice must</seg><seg type="columnLine">liave seen and known and understood the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittering promise of it, was a great vein of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold laid ban against the bottom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff-side, where last year's snows had set</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks free above; where the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff had fallen outward disclosing the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the mountains hail hidden so well</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so long.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was as rich as any pocket the miner</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever seen--richer. And it was not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket at all, but a wide, deep vein which</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran back into the mountainside; which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make not one man. but hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, rich, would give them riotous days</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wild nights, would bring to the realiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of dreams long dreamed. And Johnny</seg><seg type="columnLine">Watson, the man who had found this, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had turned back with but a handful of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">precious stuff that he might bring his</seg><seg type="columnLine">partner with him, was dead and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never take out a nugget.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All in the cards, Johnny," he mused</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitterly. "And the cards are running</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong for you and me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat upon a boulder, his eyes brood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over the yellow promise, his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy with the love for a lost partner and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the newer love for a woman who was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost as soon as he had found her. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows drew back from him, the sun found</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out; and still he sat staring at the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">which promised and mocked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, with the short laugh of a tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. he got to his feet, stood for a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at the smooth cuts a pick had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the rocky bank, and then, with no further</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken word, with no look behind him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved slowly away and went back along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge, down the pine-tree and to the lake-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There he sat down upon the big white</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock, and with the stub of a lead-pencil</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrote a letter upon the bit of oiled paper in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which his pipe tobacco was wrapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Virginia, dear, if I am never to see you again--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and who knows how a day like this is going lo end?</seg><seg type="columnLine">--this is to say good-by for mr, I think that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew how much I love you before I told you last</seg><seg type="columnLine">night- So t do not need to tell you again.

Farlfej got tu his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and waited. Neither man spuke until</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dalton came within a dozen paces of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stopped. Then Farley said quietlv--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ready?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man's face showed no emotion, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was none in his steady voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your revolver is of a smaller caliber</seg><seg type="columnLine">than mine," Farley went on iu a slow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter-of-fact tone. "You can have one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my forty-fives, if you want it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dalton looked at him curiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks. I don't want it." And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a short silence in which the t o men</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed each other steadily: "There is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. There can be no other way. f</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill you or--you kill me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then." Dalton answered, as if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected this, "if I don't come through it</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will find a couple of letters in my pock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">et. Give them to Virginia."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have written a note, too," Farley said</seg><seg type="columnLine">by way of reply. "It is for her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With slow, steady lingers he drew a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver from his holster. For the instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lost sight of the man in front of him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes went upward along the cliffs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thoughts ran ahead of them to the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the girl there. The world was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally silent, the pines about them like</seg><seg type="columnLine">carvings in jade, without a tremor, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight falling softly about them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment was strangely lacking the thrill of</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited nerves he had anticipated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That he and this man were . landing so</seg><seg type="columnLine">close together, that each held a revolver in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand, that death was very near, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world and life and love drawing very</seg><seg type="columnLine">far away, did not impress him as he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have said that such a thing would impress</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The whole thing was too big, meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much, for him lo grasp it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Virginia may come," Dalton's deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toned voice startled him. "We had better</seg><seg type="columnLine">--hurry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he answered. "We bad better</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So they stood facing each other, a gun in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond the Law</seg><seg type="columnLine">105</seg><seg type="columnLine">cach right hand, the mu2zlcs downward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was not twenty feet between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We shoot together?" Dalton was ask-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. And the signal?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Count three. That will do as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">any way. Will you count?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Farley nodded. And his voice, quiet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, steady, with regular pauses between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words, said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One--two--three!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two shots rang out together, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. And the two men, their faces gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">white and tense drawn, stood looking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other through the slowly lifting smoke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For as he fired, Farley had thrown the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muzzle of his gun downward so that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball plowed through the sand at the feet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Virginia Dalton's father, and Dalton's bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let had winged its way high overhead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking the far shore of the lake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "- you!" cried Farley shrilly, a red</seg><seg type="columnLine">flood of blood in his face as he understood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why did you do that? Do you want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be killed, man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man who could have killed him had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spared him, the man who had murdered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny Watson had stood up courting death</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had made no attempt to save himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the knowledge only maddened the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had chosen to die himself at the hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the man he could not kill--no, not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to "square tilings" for a dead partner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I have killed two men in fair fight in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life," Dalton told him sternly, his own face</seg><seg type="columnLine">flushed hotly. "I am not going to kill a</seg><seg type="columnLine">third. And I do not choose to be made to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look like a fool French dude in a polite</seg><seg type="columnLine">duel! Are you going to kill me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Farley laughed evilly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In fair fight!" he mocked. "To cut the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat out of a man before he had seen you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sneak up on him in the dark--and'you</seg><seg type="columnLine">call that fair fight!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I gave him his chance! And he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">it--not being a fool!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A chance!" scoffed Farley, the rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger within him making him for the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget that this was her father, his gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised. "To drive your-knife through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man's throat--to come at him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I used no knife, and I came upon him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in broad day fight. And I shot the throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of him, after I got this!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He threw back his shirt collar and showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a raw wound at the base of his neck. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick Farley, suddenly seeing the light of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great hope, dropped his revolver into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand as he clutched Dalton's arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't lie to me," he said in a harsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper. For he had remembered those</seg><seg type="columnLine">other tracks he had found, and his whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was shaking with what it might mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. "Where did you find him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dalton looked at him curiously, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a madman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Over yonder." His arm swung about</seg><seg type="columnLine">until his outstretched forefinger pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward 'the west--not the south. "Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had left two horses in a little hollow. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed him back-''</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Was he a little man, and stocky?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farley was crying hoarsely. "Blue-eyed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little blond mustache-?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He was a man six feet in his stockings."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dalton retorted, staring. "Black-haired</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blacker-hearted. If he was your</seg><seg type="columnLine">pardner-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He wasn't my pardner.

Don't forget; this is im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant, now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the letter that Renshawe was so ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ercised about? That leads back to a year</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago; and, of course, to a girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Renshawe had accumulated enough sa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vings to take a trip home and visit his peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple; and there he had met the most won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful girl in all the world, and, after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of strong men who have found but</seg><seg type="columnLine">little time to cultivate women, he wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">how she had escaped from Heaven, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured out seven years of pent-up devotion</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her feet. He was a new type in her mi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">croscopic orbit, this clean-cut man of swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">decision; and she had proceeded with alac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rity to add his scalp to her collection. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">another man had come. Scalps, the exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">counterpart of his, hung at her belt in rows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for she was very beautiful. There was noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing new about him. Bui--he possessed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor-car; which, of course, made decision</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of much difficulty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hitherto the most wonderful girl had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found no trouble in controlling a many-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stringed bow with neatness and despatch;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Renshawe was not of those lesser ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals that are content to hunt in packs. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature was too big to crave the support or</seg><seg type="columnLine">tolerate the presence of others on his trails.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wherefore, since he was a product of cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turies of Western civilization, and very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much a man, he did not fall upon his rival</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rend him with his teeth; but instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposed very gently to the girl that, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had to return to his work shortly in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, he would give her a year in which to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make up her mind, at the end of which time</seg><seg type="columnLine">she should write and communicate her de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This she promised with tears and soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging arms, and many protestations that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no need--she knew her mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the next day she went for an automo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bile ride just the same--West is West.</seg><seg type="columnLine">YAR MAHOMED of the Zukkha</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khel clan climbed swiftly up a steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">spur of the Sufed Koh range that</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhung the Peiwar Kotal pass, and grunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed fiercely as he swung his long limbs fr&lt; m</seg><seg type="columnLine">crag to crag, leaping, clutching and scram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling as only a born mountaineer can.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arrived at the summit, he wriggled into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nook well down from the skyline and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered out along the winding track that led</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the Kurrum valley over the border</seg><seg type="columnLine">into India.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He crouched, all careless of the precipice</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer to the pass at his side, and gazed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his pent brows like some grim bird of</seg><seg type="columnLine">prey. His keen, dark face with its great</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooked nose and fierce eyes, and the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">posture of his body, bunched forward with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lean neck outstretched, heightened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression of a great eagle watching for its</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The eyes were the most peculiar part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man--swift and keen, flashing inces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">santly from point to point. Not by any</seg><seg type="columnLine">means shift)' or afraid, but the alert eyes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the untamed creature constantly on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookout for danger and prepared to mini-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mize it by meeting it more than half-way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a long and careful scrutiny the grim</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth curled in disgust and the man spat</seg><seg type="columnLine">vindictivelv into the pass below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thukka-AUahl The dog delays," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered, and his talons curled caressingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the stock of his rifle, a beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon which carried its own story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long while he brooded, for all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world like a larger and tierccr edition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Oath by the Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">in</seg><seg type="columnLine">William Tell waiting for his Gessler. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spat again and climbed slowly down with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the comforting reflection that if Ailah</seg><seg type="columnLine">willed, tomorrow; or if not, the day after;</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the day after that. All time was before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; and, being an Oriental, he was blessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with infinite patience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yar Mahomed was by profession a man;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and according to the conventions of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">race and that part of the world he fiUed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">job very thoroughly. That is to say, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made war upon his neighbors and hated his</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies. In these degenerate times of</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace, and since the influence of the British</seg><seg type="columnLine">had begun to make itself felt, it was aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishing how far a man of action had to travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find suitable neighbors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But whether on the Kurrum border, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">down among the Beluchis, or away up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baltistan, wherever there were wars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumors of wars, Yar Mahomed arrived soon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er or later with his trusty rifle--an older</seg><seg type="columnLine">and less satisfactory one; of the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon more anon--to enlist his services</seg><seg type="columnLine">on whichever side looked like winning; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be the most loot. For the rest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was scrupulously honest, true to his salt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and possessed a very' fine conception of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal honor, an insult to which he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">resent with an immediate knife-stroke. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rifle needs special mention to itself;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for in that country the rifle is quite half the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Yar Mahomed had long been dissat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isfied with the weapon he had been carrying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was an old Martini-Henry, acquired in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the innumerable border-skirmishes</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the British, and had supplanted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet older native-made JezaiJ. For a Jong</seg><seg type="columnLine">while his heart had been content; but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a time when he had temporarily hired</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself as a guide to a sporting Englishman</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had come into the mountains to shoot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This man possessed a wonderful weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would carry true as a hair for a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand yards, and good enough to be certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">o	y°ur man for a considerable distance far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">, r: anc* ^ar Mahomed's soul lusted for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beautiful thing. But he had taken the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man s pay, and therefore figuratively</seg><seg type="columnLine">eaten his salt, and the rifle with all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other possessions of the white man were ti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> \ar Mahomed beat his breast and groan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed in anguish; and shortly Allah rewarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">his honesty. The Englishman was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased with his guide in every way that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidcd to him that a friend of his, a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">lord from England, desired to come on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar trip, and that he would surely tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friend to seek out this prince among</seg><seg type="columnLine">guides. The friend would be due in Bannu</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the British side on such and such a date.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yar Mahomed went out and prostrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself many times to the West. Allah</seg><seg type="columnLine">was God, Allah was good. In shallahl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I	have said that Yar Mahomed was strict-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly honest; and he was, as was proven in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of the Englishman. He would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbed anybody without hesitation who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have suggested to him that he should</seg><seg type="columnLine">steal a horse, or a rupee, or a handful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">grain. But rifles and ammunition are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gifts of God to mankind, free as the air they</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe and the water they drink, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">such belong naturally to whoever can ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quire them and keep them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yar Mahomed praised God for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounty, and was very sure to make no mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take about eating salt this time. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lordling arrived and went into camp with</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange guides, Punjabi Dogras, recom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mended by the Commissioner. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">child's play. The lordling slept as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep whose lives have been spent in per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petual security, and the Dogras were stuffed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with unwonted luxury in the neighboring</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent--and the moon was flecked with fleet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing shadows-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was, as I have said, a beautiful weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a Ballard .303, high velocity, bolt-action;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and .\llah had further provided two hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred rounds of ammunition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was the man who daily climbed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sufed Koh and perched above the Feiwar</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kotal gazing across the valley with hungry</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">OF COURSE there was a girl in it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or rather, as they arc there desig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated, a woman. The most won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful woman in all the world--tall, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight as a young pine from carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-jars on her head. Yar Mahomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">went straight to her father and offered forty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five good silver rupees, which was all he</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man demurred; the girl was tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strong, and would be able to extort</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite an extensive patch of corn out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleak mountain side. Thereupon the ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent young man, with all the impetuosity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a lover, offered his old rifle, the Martini-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henry, which was really worth five or .-is</seg><seg type="columnLine">I 12</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls. The old man snatched at the chance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the bargain was struck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now it happened that there was some</seg><seg type="columnLine">small bickering among the Waziri tribes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thither hastened Yar Mahomed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope of acquiring the wherewithal to set up</seg><seg type="columnLine">housekeeping. He left the most beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">embodiment of all the virtues in the care</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her father, with many injunctions re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garding her safe-keeping; quite forgetful, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his new sense of proprietorship, of the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the old man had managed to keep her</seg><seg type="columnLine">in perfect safety hitherto. This duty ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complished, he cast care to the winds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried away, scenting the battle from afar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with eager, hawk's face and distended nos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trils.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile a cousin of his own family--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a low fellow and a renegade, for he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken service with the Indian Government</seg><seg type="columnLine">--came home on leave and swaggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the hill villages, twirling his mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tache with a military air. And his evil fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought it about that he, too, saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman. He made haste to meet the father,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was apprised of the bargain already</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck with Yar Mahomed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the cousin was not bound by any fool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish tribal conventions of honor; he was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enlightened man, he had traveled afar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen the ways of the white men. He went</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct to the woman and explained how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had many rupees saved up from his pay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, above all, that he was a servant of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sirkar and would eventually retire on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pension. Can the woman be blamed?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yar Mahomed returned in due course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but, contrary to the procedure of Western</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization, was not immediately informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by sundry dear friends of the new state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs. Across the border, where strife</seg><seg type="columnLine">means knife, swift and straight to the mark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who are wise are very careful to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of other people's quarrels* excepting al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways blood feuds, which arc a matter of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligious duty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wherefore it was some little time before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yar Mahomed discovered what his cousin</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done to him; and, since he was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">product of centuries of Eastern civilization,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and very much a man, he set about seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cousin's blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But his cousin's leave had expired and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had returned to the protection of the Sir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kar; and further, Yar Mahomed learned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his regiment, had been ordered to a far coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try, called Tibet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was two years ago; and word had</seg><seg type="columnLine">now come through other soldiers on leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the man was about to return to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Which explains why Yar Mahomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">perched ominously on his pinnacle, shading</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes under his hand and gazing so in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely across the valley of Kurrum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the fourteenth day his patience was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rewarded; and he regarded the omen js</seg><seg type="columnLine">good, for there were just thirteen little nicks</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the stock of his new rifle, and just room</seg><seg type="columnLine">for one more before commencing a new line.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A speck had appeared in the far distance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the winding track, and long before it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">within range Y'ar Mahomed, with the ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal vision of the bird he so closely re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembled, had made it out to be the man he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He might have dropped him at twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards with reasonable certainty by</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting his rifle on a rock, and that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been quite in keeping with the feudist</seg><seg type="columnLine">ethics of his people; but Yar Mahomed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I	have said, was by profession a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He clambered sw'iftly down and hid in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pass till he could be reasonably certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his enemy might not escape. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously raised his head above the level of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sheltering rock and yelled:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ahoo, Lutf - UUah, cousin of mine!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greeting!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lutf-Ullah dived behind a rock with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of a great hairy tarantula which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembled, and brought his gun to the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">before looking to see where the hail came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yar Mahomed shouted like a schoolboy</seg><seg type="columnLine">with glee at the surprise he had caused, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">called again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is met.

He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a soldier, and therefore no marksman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fired three times more while the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited with cold-blooded alertness. Am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munition is always a scarcity across the bor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, and Yar Mahomed wanted to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite certain of his first shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did. As the crashing echoes raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the overhanging cliffs he coolly blew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smoke from his barrel and strode down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pass. He surveyed the scene grimly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nodded his head with satisfaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A good shot and a dean," he muttered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Oath by the Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">113</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then he took the rifle and cartridges, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are legitimate loot; and, since Lutf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ullah had been of his own family, he cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the body with boulders.

True, it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a trifling affair--only twenty rounds, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he indignantly recollected; but these ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed Feringees were apt to make such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuss over trifles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He decided that he would go up to Haz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">war and lie quiet till the white man went</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg><seg type="columnLine">away again.

Well, he would send</seg><seg type="columnLine">a messenger to try and overtake Yar Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">homed, but there was no great hope; he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone to Kabul, and he traveled fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Renshawe thanked the crafty old pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">triarch and presently withdrew. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was lying, but one doesn't voice such</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">crude accusations across the bonier. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, there were other ways; men could al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways be found, renegades or fugitives from</seg><seg type="columnLine">other tribes, who would exchange informa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion for money.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT night Yar Mahomed re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived a message to the effect that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unbelieving dog was an officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Border Police, and that he came for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the English lord's rille. But that Yar Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">homed might rest in peace, for the Feringee</seg><seg type="columnLine">was open-faced and foolish, and would ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complish nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But three days later a breathless runner</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought nov.v that the Feringee was even</seg><seg type="columnLine">then making his way to Hazwar. Yar Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">homed hastily gathered up his gear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved far up the mountains to Faizkot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving information at Hazwar that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone west to Rohat. Faizkot was an al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most inaccessible mountain village, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had yet to meet the white man who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow him in his own mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a week a rumor came up of a man win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowing the villages above Hazwar. Yar</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mahomed cursed gutturally. This Feringee</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not as others he had met; he was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming a nuisance. In the first flush of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce rage his primal impulse was to lie in</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait for him and kill him; but he hesitated</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that. The killing of a white man brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain trouble with the Sir/far, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paying of heavy fines, and perhaps white</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers quartered in the hill villages; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew that his private troubles were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth all that to the malika. He doubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to Kurrum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To detail the long chase that ensued</seg><seg type="columnLine">would fill a book. Yar Mahomed broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his more familiar country to the Ghii-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sai tribes, and from them to the Bazid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khels. For the first time in his life be was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to admit a touch of admiration for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unbeliever; and with it a feeling some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing akin to apprehension crept into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul, for there was something terrifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">about this tireless, silent Nemesis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Renshawe stuck doggedly to his quest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruclly handicapped by the universally in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctive union of the colored man against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white. Frequently he lost all trace; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribesmen lied through long habit, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether they knew anything about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter or no, they misdirected him on prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciple-	. , . •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But by careful analysis and a judicious</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> use ol lus keen knowledge of native char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acter he always eventually picked up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail again. Lately, fur a long lime, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been able to glean any information at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. The man seemed to have disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air; and this was because Yar Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">homed, recognizing that information as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his whereabouts leaked from the villages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had embarked on a new plan of camping</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on the mountains alone. But Ren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shawe was nearer to him than he imagined</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he became cognizant of the fact with</seg><seg type="columnLine">startling unpleasantness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Renshawe toiled up a barren slope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">doggedly but rather hopelessly, out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of his eye he caught die puff of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin feather of smoke that flashed out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a far ridge. Instantly he threw himself flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his face, and at the same instant a thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">whine sang over the place where he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The temptation had been too much for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yar Mahomed. Coming over the spur Le</seg><seg type="columnLine">had caught sight of his enemy, and the swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">access of rage had overcome all i-ihtr con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderations. The fact that he had lired</seg><seg type="columnLine">from ambush showed w'hat a demoralizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect this relentless pursuit was having on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nerves, if such a man could be said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have nerves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some inkling of this found it:, way into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Renshawe's mind as he swiftly stalked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot, for he grinned all over his face for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time in many da3rs. He considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself almost at hand-grips now; for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the spot was empty and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no trace on the rocky ground, only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes separated him from the man whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had hitherto been regarding as an elusive</seg><seg type="columnLine">fugitive. But the sudden shot woke him</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the fact that he was dealing with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yar Mahomed, for his part, was thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oughly convinced of the fact. Having once</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened hostilities, there would be no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">running away--something which his fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul had rebelled against from the begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The twro men were stalking each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">now; yet so many hiding-places did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains offer, and so well did each know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to take advantage of them, that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not till the second evening that they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Honors fell to the white man--white now</seg><seg type="columnLine">only by courtesy; for so sunburnt and gaunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his face from exposure, and so ragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Oath by the Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">ii5</seg><seg type="columnLine">his khaki shooting-suit, that he might easiJy</seg><seg type="columnLine">have passed for a Gurkha from his own be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved hills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was cautiously working down a ridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">when his quick eyes, trained to the obser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vation of Nature, noticed a kite wheeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">lazily in the sky. He watched it critically;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he rose with a seraphic grin and drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped swiftly down the ravine. Woodsman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">deduction had told him that the bird was</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching something alive below; alive and</seg><seg type="columnLine">active, for it kept its distance. Had the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject been sleeping, or perhaps dying, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore feeble, it would have swung much</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower; had it been dead, the bird would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have settled to feed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He climbed the other side with eager an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticipation just crackling out of his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There would be a fight; this man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given him such a long chase would surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight; and, though it would have been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuine shock to realize it, Renshawe rev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eled heathenishly in a good fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He peered carefully over the ridge, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost shouted. Some two hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther, from behind an intervening hog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, rose a thin curl of smoke. He ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward softly, with all the restrained eager-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of a panther following a grazing buck;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hurried, bending low, from rock to rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">craning his neck over each, and taking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">craziest chances of making a noise in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerness to get over loose ground. But at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hogback caution returned. With in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finite weariness he edged up to eye-level,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rifle ready for instant action--and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he boldly stood upright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hundred yards further, with his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, sat a man with a rifle under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thigh, preparing a meal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Renshawe's great chest expanded with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep breath. At last!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     HE THRUST his rifle forward and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     hailed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      "O/te, Yar Mahomed! Yield</seg><seg type="columnLine">thee!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, curiously enough, Yar Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">homed acted with the same hereditary in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinct that Lutf-Ullah had shown on a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar occasion. He took a flying dive for</seg><seg type="columnLine">crr'. a.nd .bul,et whizzed past Ren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shawe s head while he was almost yet in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And some curious impulse common to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the type caused Renshawe to throw back</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head and shout with laughter at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ungainly' figure cut by the tall Afghan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He lifted his head a trifle incautiously af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter the outburst, and an immediate bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting his hair showed him that his oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent certainly knew his weapon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Curiously enough again, Yrar Mahomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more followed the example set by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">late cousin. He fired wildly several times.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But not from nervousness or fear; he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">consumed with wild rage. The fact alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was face to face at last with his per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">secutor was enough to rouse him to fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">indignation; and that he, Yar Mahomed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been caught by an unbelieving dog of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Feringee was an ineffaceable disgrace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thought drove him nearly frantic. Also</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had heard the laugh following on his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot, and the knowledge that the accursed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feringee mocked him goaded him beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">all control of himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Renshawe, perfectly cool and alert,</seg><seg type="columnLine">held his fire, just as Yar Mahomed had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that previous occasion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently a dagger-stroke of thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck through the Afghan's quivering rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">with paralyzing force. Ammunition! This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ever a scarcity, and Yar Mahomed's</seg><seg type="columnLine">scanty supply had already been much de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted in procuring food during the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">month. A swift inspection of the magazine</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw him for an instant into a cold sweat,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be followed immediately after by a fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">paroxysm of rabid fury-. He had only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">cartridge left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thought of capture by this accursed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feringee was frenzy. He tried to collect</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to make an end with his last shot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could do it; he couldn't miss at a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred yards if only he got a grip of himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Yar Mahomed came of a fanatical race;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw a chance--a poor one; snatched at</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, fired wildly--and then went ghazi.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Which is akin to amok, with the difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Ghazi has the Prophet's assurance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of certain Paradise if he can but kill one</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christian before he dies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tension had been too great. Yar Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">homed threw away his rifle and rushed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slope, frothing at the mouth, blazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">red from his eyes, and howling like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chained devil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Renshawe stepped out to meet him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">without the least flurry brought the sights</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bear on his broad chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  If he had not had such a perfect control</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a perfect nerve he might have fired; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he waited his mind was running freely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ii6</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">and something out of the centuries of West-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern civilization came and implanted a vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression that there was something of au</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfair advantage in this. And hand in hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it came the startling anomaly of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pre-adamite craving to get to grips with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Renshawe softly laid down liis rifle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew the wicked Gurkha kukric of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills from its sheath with a slow, grim smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">that left his lips parted in an expression of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce eagerness. The joy of battle blazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now there was by no means anything of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chivalrous foolhardiness in this. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been demonstrated time and again in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">annals of the British army in India that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">active little Gurkhas armed with their hack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blade were more than a match, hand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, for the big Afghans with their stab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing Kkaibari knife. Renshawe was cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly carried beyond all resemblance to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal self by the "fierce joy that warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel," or he might never have taken such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance; but he felt perfect confidence in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own phenomenal quickness and trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles against a much bigger and clumsier</seg><seg type="columnLine">opponent. And this is the God-given gift to</seg><seg type="columnLine">all natural-born fighting-men--the supreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence of winning. That is why they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are fighting-men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stepped forward to a level spot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited with tense muscles slightly crouched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">poised on the balls of his feet, and weaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrible curved blade in and out before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At any other time even such a man as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yar Mahomed might well have hesitated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at least fought warily, but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghazi; he leaped in with a howl and a hiss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing stab of his great three-foot blade. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Renshawe easily evaded and returned with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a swift swing at the stomach after the Gur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kha manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet the long-limbed fanatic was no nov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice at knif e-play. With a lightning recovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">he met the blade on his own and whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up for another slashing stroke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Renshawe stepped swiftly inside the blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that the man's arm jarred on liis shoulder;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at the same time he drove heavily for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the neck. And then his heart came up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouth where he could taste it, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade caught in the huge iron brooch that</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the Afghan's sheepskin poshlein to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether at the shoulder, and twisted from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yar Mohamed howled aloud with de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moniac joy and heaved up his arm for a fi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nal stab. Renshawe's mind worked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speed and accuracy of the well-kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine that it was. In the second that</seg><seg type="columnLine">elapsed between his disastrous stroke and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ret urn he had rejected half a dozen pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibilities and seized on the one winch would</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve him best; and here his jiu-jitsu skill</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood him in good stead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaped up at the raised arm, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands met with a soft smack. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar double grip, enclosing hand and hilt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pressed away the driving stroke that</seg><seg type="columnLine">whizzed by his side like a lightning bolt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the same thing happened; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Then Renshawe saw his chance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped in close, turning his back to his op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponent so that the stabbing arm came down</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his shoulder. A little farther out. and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elbow would have struck his shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the swift jerk that he gave would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped it like a clay pipe-stem.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it was, in his anxiety to gtt well within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blow he had not taken into account tl :</seg><seg type="columnLine">Afghan's great length of limb; the fulcn m</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his shoulder caught the upper part oi the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm and the snapping WTench only availed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to jerk the great knife from the paralyzed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS man against man now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast against breast; trained mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cle and phenomenal skill against</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute straigth and berserk fun,-. Their sin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ews cracked as they strained and stamped</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the broken ground, working farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">and farther down the slope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the maniac-light began to d&gt;e</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the Afghan's eyes; the fanatical fury</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spent itself, and he began to fight with</seg><seg type="columnLine">more cunning, while he marveled at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparatively small man who stood against</seg><seg type="columnLine">him so evenly. As they swung with straining</seg><seg type="columnLine">chests and hissing breath the loose stones</seg><seg type="columnLine">made foothold impossible, and presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">they fell to the ground with interlocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There the mad struggle continued. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled ever lower and farther, neither gain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing any marked advantage, and both grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing equally spent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a final heave carried them both</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a small declivity, locked in a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">clawing mass of venom and fight, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck with a heavy thud and rolled apart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Renshawe struggled slowly to his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Oath by the Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">117</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly shaken, and stood panting, expecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other's attack; till he saw, to his im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense relief, that the Afghan was evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">as badly jolted as himself, for he made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">move to renew the combat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, as they glared with bloodshot</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and heaving lungs, from a nestling</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain village far below floated the boom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a gong and the clear call of the muezzin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ella-a-hi ho Allah! Akhbar Alla-a-ah--</seg><seg type="columnLine">God is I he God! Praise be to God!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Renshawe smiled painfully. The incon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gruity of it struck some hidden note of grim</seg><seg type="columnLine">humor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is thy time for prayer, O Mussulman</seg><seg type="columnLine">--perchance the last. Take it," he advised.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt that he would be glad of the res-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sweating Mohammedan thought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same. As for prayer--well, they were both</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of reach of weapons and the white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">could take no advantage; he would show</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. And forthwith, with superb disdain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned his back and faced the west.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hear the voice of God!" chanted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muezzin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the follower of the Prophet knelt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his hands to his ears--and the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man drew in great life-giving drafts of air</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thanked his own God for the rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the last note had died away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, the great Afghan rose gravely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">surveyed his enemy with a thoughtful look,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinged with a man's admiration for a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sahib," he said at length, "what need</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we two slay one another?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None," answered Renshawe promptly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"if thou wilt but deliver what I seek."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The battle-light began to come back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other's eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Give thee my rifle? Nay, it is mine to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, by the law of conquest. My life first."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rifle? muttered Renshawe wondering-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. "What need have I of thy rifle?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What matter is it then that thou hast</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed me for this month past?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The matter of Lutf-Ullah."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was across the border," flashed Yar</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mahomed hotly. "There is no penalty. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a feud according to our custom."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There is no talk of penalty. What have</seg><seg type="columnLine">I to do with thy feuds? But the matter is</seg><seg type="columnLine">this.

Sark and Bassett wiggled their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat over into it and launched off. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">June high-water on the Yukon, and, swollen</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Hoods of big tributaries such as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Klondike, the Sixtymile, the Stewart, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White and the Pelly, the river was running</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of the leading boats couJd be heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the haze, speeding down with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift current towards fresno Creek, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowed into the Yukon some fourteen miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">below Dawson, but these were ones whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">early start assured them time enough to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">in on the creek by the water route.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men in the later-launched boats had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no good chance of overtaking the leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stolen Thunder</seg><seg type="columnLine">121</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones, and they apparently knew it. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not risk everything on the attempt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were heading across towards the west</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank of the Yukon where the trail from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dawson City to Glacier Creek, up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sixtymile country, began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The route by land was shorter than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">route by water, and in case Fresno should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be staked well up to the head when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived, they would not be compelled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">waste time traveling the whole creek length</seg><seg type="columnLine">before grabbing some ground. This was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan of the partners, and they could now see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this was the plan of Casino also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give up his dash down-stream!" com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented Bassett, staring after Casino's craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was moving faster than theirs.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">river was a mile wide at this point. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">partners were only an eighth of a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, and they were not long reaching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They did not stop to pull up their craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">but leaped as soon as it struck the shallows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The water splashed them to the waist, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mud threatened to mire them com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely, yet other boats afloat or in the act</seg><seg type="columnLine">of getting afloat from the bank paid them</seg><seg type="columnLine">no attention. The minds of the owners took</seg><seg type="columnLine">cognizance of nothing but the stampede, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sark and Bassett floundered out unaided</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gained the muck-trampled shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The pernicious parasite!" gritted Sark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anathematizing Casino while he slapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water from his thighs.

Stay here till I beg,</seg><seg type="columnLine">borrer or steal somethin' that floats!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a wallowing hippopotamus, Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploughed down the muddy bank, casting</seg><seg type="columnLine">covetous eyes on many a craft whose owners</seg><seg type="columnLine">ominously warned him off, until finally he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran into a Swede 'longshoreman disembark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing part of the cargo of a grounded river</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamer from a boat the size of a scow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, Ole, I want that boat," Bassett</seg><seg type="columnLine">informed.

The unwieldy</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, the size of a scow, was warped around</seg><seg type="columnLine">and poked clear of the shallows.

The main</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush was miles ahead of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only the stragglers were here at the rear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But their feet once upon the well-known</seg><seg type="columnLine">Glacier Creek trail, Tom and Eric pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded to make up lost time.

Alter that the partners ran practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, and up to the end of the first hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they crossed the headwaters of Que-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bec Creek they saw no more stampedcrs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Casino's certainly hikin' 'em along," ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served Bassett, as he and Sark paused a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments at Quebec Creek to breathe them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Glacier Creek trail roughly followed the low</seg><seg type="columnLine">di\ ide l&gt;ing between Swede Creek and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">\ ukon River. Valleys flooded with hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">water stretched away on either hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wedges of wild fowl drove over the watery</seg><seg type="columnLine">wastes. Flowers, new-sprung from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snows, raised their blossoms by the trail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, and animal life scurried in the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush, but these attributes of Spring did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not smite on the consciousness of the men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their minds were focused on Fresno.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They sped viciously, blindly, reeking in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat bath, flinging ridge and valley, bluff</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gulch, scrub timber and niggerhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp behind. They p&gt;assed the dwindling</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper reaches of another small stream be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond Quebec Creek, and a couple of miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond that struck the extreme tip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fresno.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the -wisdom of following the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">route became apparent, for Fresno Creek,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although its main trend was almosl due</seg><seg type="columnLine">■west, curved south before reaching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Glacier Creek trail, paralleled it for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance and met it half-way back to Que-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bec Creek. It was as if while the stampede</seg><seg type="columnLine">was racing for the creek, the creek was</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisting back to meet the stampede.</seg><seg type="columnLine">■ AS THEY plunged down the Fresno</seg><seg type="columnLine">bench-ground at a jarring run, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">partners felt the disappointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">qualms of the stampeder who arrives too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late. Here there was little mist. Fires</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazed down all the length of the valley, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires at the head meant that the creek was</seg><seg type="columnLine">located from the mouth up. In the creek</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself poling-boats splashed along, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamor dinned out on the shores.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Staked to the pearly sky-line.

These bills of sale had a mone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary as well as a documentary value and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though scribbled with pencil on scraps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper, each was sound as a bond and good</seg><seg type="columnLine">for two thousand dollars in Dawson City.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Using this same class of currency, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">partners then w'ent down the creek on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same mission. The sale of claims Twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three, Twenty-Two, Twenty'-One, Twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Nineteen Above hastened the sale of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others. It set the pace and the price.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By morning the partners had purchased</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything in sight, clear to Fresno's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Halpune was the only man who succeeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in holding them up, but the fact that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally sold Discovery', a thousand foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim, and One Below Discover,-, which as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discoverer he was privileged by law to</seg><seg type="columnLine">locate, for five thousand dollars each, showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom and Eric how inflated was the four-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollar pan report.

You'd better bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tagish Jim and a dozen or a dozen and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of the Chilcats with you to prove up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of the holdin's. Things'll sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">assume gigantic proportions here, and we'U</seg><seg type="columnLine">126</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">need that many at the start.

In his poling-boat, working</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him, was the Chilcat foreman, Tagish</seg><seg type="columnLine">JLm, and behind in more poling-boats were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixteen more Chit cats, sun-smoked, huge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscled men, giants of the open, fit engines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of toil to tear up the stubborn creek limits</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wrest from the golden gravels Bassett's</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-five million dollars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boats were beached on Twenty-Four</seg><seg type="columnLine">and iwenty-Five Above. The Chilcats</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped swiftly out and began to kindle a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, oval tire in the fashion they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned of white men whereon to cook their</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening meal. Sark looked around for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">partner and discovered him smoking quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the edge of the prospect hole which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now enlarged to the proportions of a shaft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What depth's bed-rock, Tom?" was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first anxious question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twelve feet," Basset answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pay-streak's slx feet thick, then? How's</seg><seg type="columnLine">it panning now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jist the same."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine! Glad to hear that, partner. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a little worried, you know. I made</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of a discovery in Dawson, a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery I didn't somehow like, Tom!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bassett twisted around on the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft, took his pipe from his lips and gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixedly at Sark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was it?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You remember what we heard through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crack in the wall in the Northern Light?</seg><seg type="columnLine">We heard Gunboat tell the rest that Hal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pune had recorded just as the recording-</seg><seg type="columnLine">office closed. Today's the twelfth. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was yesterday, the eleventh. Well, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mining records don't say so. I looked when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I recorded what we bought, and when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to get the transfer of Halpune's, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found he had recorded his Discovery and</seg><seg type="columnLine">One Below Discovery on the tenth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He did, eh?" mused Bassett. "Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fits in with a discovery I've made my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. I've found out, Eric, that the date on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the location notices on every claim we've</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought is June the tenth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tarnation, Tom! I was suspicious as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as I saw it. Only I thought there</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been some mistake. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">date of Halpune's recording and the date</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the notices sure can't both be mistakes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's only one thing that can mean."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only one thing, pardner. Them claims</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all measured out and staked the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the stampede started. Casino's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man as did it. You didn't notice anythin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecooliar about the names of the claim</seg><seg type="columnLine">owners did you, when you was giltin' things</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed up?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I noticed that they were all Casino's</seg><seg type="columnLine">close friends, every hard-bitten beggar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. That struck me as rather funny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was part of the plan, Eric. Casino's</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked a colossal come-on, and we fell for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. 1II tell you of another discovery I made</seg><seg type="columnLine">while you was gone. I discovered that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">claims we staked was salted. Salted on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boundary' line jist whar two pardner.' .vouid</seg><seg type="columnLine">nacherally sink their prospeck hole."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Salted, Tom? But there you're wrong.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There you sure touch my pride. No man</seg><seg type="columnLine">can sell me ground that's been dug before</seg><seg type="columnLine">without me knowing it. J.'ll take my altar</seg><seg type="columnLine">oath that nobody had put shovel into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muck of that prospect hole before mine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm always on my guard against that trick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stuff we panned was there by nature. '</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, it wasn't, neither. It was planted."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But wouldn't somebody have to dig to</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nope, they tunneled from the river."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, and it full of water! I guess not!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They tunneled before thar was any</seg><seg type="columnLine">water," Bassett calmly explained. "Tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neled when it was frozen. Now do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">savvy? The pav-streak we struck wasn't no</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay-streak at all. It was gravel shoveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in thar and sowed with a few ounces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fortymile or Sixtymile or Stewart River</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold. I've got it all in my pocket, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know whereof 1 speak. But if you're any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wav doubtful, come and have a look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft."</seg><seg type="columnLine">BASSETT plucked a burning stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Chilcats' fire for a torch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lighted the way. He thrust the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch into the open shaft whose black</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth yawned with a twelve-foot yawn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Eric climbed down on the rude pole</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladder, made of a small tree trunk with</seg><seg type="columnLine">many limb crotches, to look. At tin level</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his head he saw what was beyond denial</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old workings of a tunnel driven in from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Fresno's bed. The fact that it was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">low down suggested that it had been driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stolen Thunder</seg><seg type="columnLine">127</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time of frost, and the settling of the oozing</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, leaving a gap at the tunnel roof, sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied the proof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It sure was a pippin of a plan, Tom,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">admired Eric, climbing out again, "and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-matured pippin at that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yep," agreed Bassett, "so ripe it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotten to the core. Casino's some con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientious artist, eh? Jist made one slip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forgot to date the location notices one day</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. You see, he must 'a' prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">this salt not long before the ice-run and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooked up the stampede to suit. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">game's a lot like checkers, pardner. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the play's through, you kin look back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the moves you didn't see before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Casino chose his ground, chose the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to make the strike and chose the</seg><seg type="columnLine">members to compose the rush. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had Halpune record, and watched for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to spring the discovery stuff on us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the chance hadn't 'a' come in the North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern Light, it would 'a' come in the Moose-</seg><seg type="columnLine">horn or the Polaris, or down by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes on the river bank or out behind a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bale of goods on the steamer landin', jist</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherever we happened to be and oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunities looked good.

But it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">well acted, Eric, we got to admit that. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes me laugh when I think of it. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunderin' well acted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh yes, Tom, and so was the collision</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunt in the street and the waterlogged boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the \ ukon River! There were no black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flies on that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ^No sir, it was all in the program, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">comedy in four acts and I dunno how many</seg><seg type="columnLine">scenes. All arranged, even to the two last</seg><seg type="columnLine">claims saved for us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alightn t Casino have got slipped up</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Mightn't a couple of outsiders--for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know there were outsiders vainly tail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mg m on the stampede--have pounced on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ground?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you ever dream it, pardner. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">outsider could V got that. Casino and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tour pals next him would 'a' shifted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stakes of the five claims so as to blanket that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thousand feet and reserve it till we</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed up. Thar's no use prevaricatin' or</seg><seg type="columnLine">equivocatm' about it to ourselves. We was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ones destined to buy, and we bravely</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought. My respeck for that geezer Ca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sino's increasin' every day, Eric. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">raore'n a conscientious artist. He's a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">student of human nature. He was aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our frailties and our love of lucre. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowed as sure as the Y'ukon Summer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">back agin that we'd buy the creek if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck any kind of showin'. He seen us do</seg><seg type="columnLine">it many a time, and he knowed we'd do it</seg><seg type="columnLine">once too often."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, we've gone and done it once too</seg><seg type="columnLine">often," chuckled Sark mirthlessly. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Casino's pocketed the money. Wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he paid each man to run in the salted</seg><seg type="columnLine">stampede?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twenty-five dollars and the fun of it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazarded Tom. "Mebbe fifty dollars at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outside."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Call it fifty, then. That would be forty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">six men to pay, not counting himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twenty-three hundred dollars to pay out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he got one hundred and two thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">in.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the place he sought, kicked some dirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">awray and flashed the flame of a sulphur</seg><seg type="columnLine">match upon the rock face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!'' he urged. "You vowed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creek seemed quartz)*. What do you thinka</seg><seg type="columnLine">that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sark stared through the brief flame-flare,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his eyes strained and became fixed.

"That's a ledge to Live and</seg><seg type="columnLine">die on. Tom. Have you staked her?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. I waited till you come with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chilcats.

What kind-a claims</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody could say if the matter popped up</seg><seg type="columnLine">for jurisdiction. Because the hull thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a salt, you see. W'e couldn't prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">placer or pay-streak. And you sure kin't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stake twice on the same creek. So if our</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twenty-Four and Twenty-Five Above hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to be rooled on as quartz, our stakin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this ledge would be void, and we'd lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hull thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Casino and the rest of his bunch is in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same box.

W'e</seg><seg type="columnLine">dunno whether it's a quartz claim, placer</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim or dredgin' limit, but we re Iaw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abidin' men, and we live up to the letter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the minin' regulations. You're runnin' the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hull show, and if anybody happens along jist</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell 'em so. That ground under your feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">is worth twelve thousand dollars if its worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">a disfigured cent. You kin drive your Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery stake right thar whar that out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crop is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Methodically Tagish Jim went about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">business. First of all he drove his Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery stake at the spot Bassett indicated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he paced off seven hundred and fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet along the ledge on each side of the Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery post and at these points drove posts</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers one and two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At right angles to the line between posts</seg><seg type="columnLine">one and two and beginning at the posts</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves, he paced the distance to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boundary of the already staked claims on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creek limits. This distance was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">great, because the limits commenced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope almost from the Fresno's brink with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp incline to strike the ridge which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stolen Thunder</seg><seg type="columnLine">129</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed the bench ground. It was only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and eighty feet. The rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quartz claim lay upon the other side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">location line. But there was no need to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace that. It was a simple matter of sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traction. So Tagish w-ent back and w'ith a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stub of a pcncil scrawled the inscriptions on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stakes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The inscription upon the first post he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven read:</seg><seg type="columnLine">DISCOVERY FOST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That upon number one and two posts</seg><seg type="columnLine">was:</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quartz Claim--Tagish Jim--June 12th</seg><seg type="columnLine">1320--180</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The figures 1320 represented the number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of feet lying to the left of the location line,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the figures 1S0 the number lying to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. Thus, although the claim had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">stable boundaries, Tagish Jim held in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own incontestable right a plot of ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">containing fifty-one and two-thirds acres, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">square plot in dimensions, though corru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gated as to surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sitting smoking upon a huge outjutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulder on the ridge, Sark and Bassett</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched Tagish complete the staking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the Chilcat had inscribed, he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ax and began to blaze more open his</seg><seg type="columnLine">location line. Below him another Chilcat</seg><seg type="columnLine">was working at the same thing, and belowr</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one, dim in the hazy distance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving like gnomes on the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge, other Chilcats staked other claims.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'The hour's about up," announced Sark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glancing at his watch. "They ought to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">all on the job now.

He's cornin' on the jump."</seg><seg type="columnLine">BIN A moment the partners could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see several figures rushing up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Casino's camp where all the members</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the salted stampede were holding a jovial</seg><seg type="columnLine">session. Casino himseLf was in the lead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Ante, Gunboat, Slim and Alabama</seg><seg type="columnLine">straining after him, stumbling over rocks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">logs, stumps and crashing through patches</seg><seg type="columnLine">ol dense undergrowth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey you," yelled Casino, catching sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sark and Bassett and panting up to them</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What in tarnation's afoot?

What's in the air?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ask Tagish Jim, thar," suggested Bas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sett. "We're not doin' this.

Casino echoed. "Then I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. I thought in my own mind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed creek looked more like quartz than</seg><seg type="columnLine">placer.

I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash it up for you." Bassett stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">across, kicked the loose dirt off the quartz</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge and flared a match over the bared</seg><seg type="columnLine">vein.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thunderation!" screeched Casino.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fair showin'!

They could ga^p</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing coherent of comment or description.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They could only breathe forth unintelligible</seg><seg type="columnLine">monosyllabic imprecations and stare wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed at the ledge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stake boys, stake, fast as flesh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood'll let you," Casino exhorted, heaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quartette off his back. "I'm goin' in</seg><seg type="columnLine">next Tagish."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, you ain't, Casino," differed Bassett,</seg><seg type="columnLine">catching him by the arm and whirling him</seg><seg type="columnLine">about in his first stride. "That ground next</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tagish is staked."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me where I'll stake, then," implored</seg><seg type="columnLine">Casino frantically. "Where'd you stake</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I ain't staked. I had already staked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this creek, and by that action I surrendered</seg><seg type="columnLine">my rights. So did Eric.

But, the door of the Garth apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment reached, and the motor-brigand dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed, Maia spoke her mind. She spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">it briefly and in a low tone, but very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She told the sullenly listening Kiel just</seg><seg type="columnLine">what a criminally reckless and recklessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">criminal exploit he was planning. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved clearly that no man in his senses</seg><seg type="columnLine">would set forth on such an errand, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one who was not at heart dishonest could</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much ns give the scheme a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said he would break her heart with</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry.

She told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the taking of the Shem-cs-Nabi w'ould</seg><seg type="columnLine">be wicked theft that no wretched legal</seg><seg type="columnLine">sophistry could condone, and that a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who could do such a thing and make any</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl so miserably unhappy by going into</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger was not worthy her bothering over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She did not play the virago, nor did she</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry.

Her voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook, it is true, and she spoke very fast--</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact, some of her wrords and even sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tences had to be guessed, and Moylan</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed them with fearful correctness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One thing, however, she did not leave to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his imagination nor to the chances of guess-</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. At the end of her little speech, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a bad cold began to impede her dic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, she said slowly and distinctly that if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kiel should persist in his wildly sinful in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent he need never, never come to see her--</seg><seg type="columnLine">or try to communicate with her upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">return. The acquaintance would end, here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To which he retorted that if he did not go</seg><seg type="columnLine">the acquaintance must end anyhow, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had reached the point where it could no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer be mere acquaintance, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">finances wrould never, under present condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, reach the stage w'here it could be any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing stronger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With which grumbled morsel of repartee</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ljssed her, before she could prevent him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a.nd then strode tragically and rapidly away</seg><seg type="columnLine">before she could rebuke him--a double un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iairness that was perhaps the cause of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepless and somewhat lacrimosc night</seg><seg type="columnLine">At daybreak Maia called up Kiel's rooms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had tramed a new and absolutely irrefu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table set of arguments against his going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syria, but she had no chance to deliver</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">light was better than in the Scrail treasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, but not brilliant. So far as Kiel</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see by it, the Shcm-cs-lYabi was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly different, on close examination, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the imitation he had so deftly substituted</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The band of gold was old and badly worn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so badly that its row of hieroglyphs was</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-nigh effaced.

There, vouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">for by a local muezzin--whose total lack, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous acquaintance with the foreigner</seg><seg type="columnLine">was easily bridged by a judicious use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bakshish--he had entered the treasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber with a line of devotees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he passed the guarded little shrine he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stumbled awkwardly over the hem of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his robe, had lurched forward and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught at the shrine to save himself from</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling. Then as two soldiers and a priest</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sprung at him he had recovered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance, salaaming low. And as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible he had withdrawn from the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from the building, having neatly palmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring and left in its place the substitute</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented to him by Judge Gregg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now that the first and worst peril was</seg><seg type="columnLine">past, his wits rose to the next step.

The ring and the other treasures</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be put back in their proper resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">places. Then, infallibly, the guardian of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Shem-es-Nabi would discover the fraud,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the alarm would flash throughout all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Moslem world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fanatic zeal would wing the search, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that search would be of a sort not lightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">eluded.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortest way to the coast from Damascus is</seg><seg type="columnLine">by way of Beirut. Next to that, a journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">southward to Jerusalem and JalTa, or a trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the mountains westward to Tyre or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sidon, or some other coast town where ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wherefore, as Kiel had already fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casted, every one of those ports would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched with a vigilance that would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the all-seeing Eye of Mormonism seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">strabismic. The customs folk, with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">array of police-spy helpers, would infallibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">search to the skin every departing native or</seg><seg type="columnLine">tourist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Kiel had laid his plans according! v.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having wasted a bare half minute in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspection of his booty, he wrapped the ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a dirty amulet case such as desert trav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">elers wear, and strapped it firmly beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bend of his left knee. He covered this</seg><seg type="columnLine">strap with a ragged cloth on which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">traces of dried blood. It was a typical Syr-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ian bandage--one that would have brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">tears of horror to the eyes of a first-year</seg><seg type="columnLine">medical student.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, arranging his small hoard of money</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a turban and putting it on his head, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped his other belongings in a big bun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle, slung it over liis shoulder and, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">serviceable old-fashioned arm} pistol stuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">prominently in his belt, sallied forth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through an alley he wound his way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thence to the bazaar section, with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">rat tan-woven roofs of brown, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the East's yellow light filters coolly</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon the shop-lined byways. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bazaars were crowded, for the heat of tl.e</seg><seg type="columnLine">day was passing, and Kiel was forced lo</seg><seg type="columnLine">slacken his pace more than once as the foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowds wyere jostled aside to permit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing of some laden camel or string of</seg><seg type="columnLine">donkeys, or a rich man s horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bazaars were left behind, after an</seg><seg type="columnLine">interminable time, and he swung out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clearer passage of "The Street That</seg><seg type="columnLine">Is Called Straight"-- the oldest street, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a name, on earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In time this merged into walled orchards</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then into open spaces where scavenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs and black-winged gray crows squab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled over carrion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A final turn brought Kiel into a field</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'here a swarm of men were loafing idly</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a dozen busy natives who were en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaged in arranging loads upon the backs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">as many kneeling camels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was Kiel's first stopping-place, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he drifted unobserved into the throng of on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ohll" a gorilla-faced man in a once-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiutecaftan and a green turban was squall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.

Where the ordinary plodding</seg><seg type="columnLine">caravan took from five to six weeks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the tedious journey across the Sy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rian Desert, Raad on his Bisharin racing</seg><seg type="columnLine">camel covered the distance in ten brief days</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a feat that called forth the wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiration of all Syria.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To him sand-storm, Bedouin raid, perils</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thirst, of sickness, of sunstroke, were mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters for easy scorn. Was he not the fearless</seg><seg type="columnLine">Raad whom no less a personage than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pasha himself was wont to salute in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bazaar?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kiel grudgingly paid down his forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">medjidie advance money to the caravan</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner, finding and counting out each piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a separate groan. As he finished the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation his glance momentarily crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of Raad--Raad whose pet he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a child, in the mission house at Nabous</seg><seg type="columnLine">--Raad, with whom he had passed an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant hour the previous day--Raad, w'ho</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this minute had in his money-belt three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred medjidie which Kiel had turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to him twenty-four hours earlier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The negro's gaze traveled carelessly past</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kiel, and the redoubtable mail-carrier con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued on his way to the corner of the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">where his two camels were cared for by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">black attendant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Between these two camels and those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the caravan there was as much difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">as between a Percheron and a thoroughbred</seg><seg type="columnLine">race horse. Gray-white in hue, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean of limb, graceful as fawns, unbelieva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bly swift.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  One was for Raad's use; the other was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">traverse the desert journey, alongside, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of accident or emergency. He rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">each on alternate trips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both now were well rested from the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaunt from Bagdad. Their spongy feet were</seg><seg type="columnLine">free from abrasions. Their humps were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hi"h and~pendulous. At a pinch, and if not</seg><seg type="columnLine">meantime supplied with water, both were</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to travel a hundred leagues, across</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert sands, in five days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But at the end of such a forced ride their</seg><seg type="columnLine">humps would be little larger than a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">two lists, and they would be as savage as</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick bears. And, after stopping for water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would be loggy and slow for the next,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The mail-carrier starts when we do?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kiel asked the caravan owner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not he!" sneered the latter. "He is too</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud to start with common folk. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">starts after star-shine, that he may make</seg><seg type="columnLine">his first twelve hours in the cool. Mount</seg><seg type="columnLine">your camel, Effendi.

Kiel jumped to his kneeling mount.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grunting and bubbling, the twelve heavy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laden draft camels scrambled to their feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, of their own accord, took their proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">alignment for the march.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not Moylan Kiel's first, nor hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dredth, experience in the unlovely art of</seg><seg type="columnLine">camel riding. He understood the knack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting into the divan-like, high-pommeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle and, once there, how to dispose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the painful excess of leg length that such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">position always develops.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not even feel the almost universal</seg><seg type="columnLine">qualm that assails amateur riders when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">camel rises pitchingly to its feet and strikes</seg><seg type="columnLine">its gait--a gait not unlike the motion on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship deck in a choppy sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Off moved the twelve-beast caravan in</seg><seg type="columnLine">triple alignment, four deep, sixty feet be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween ranks, out of the Square of the Cara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vans and outward toward the barely visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">strip of sand that lay like a yellow sword-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade, a day's journey to the northeast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kiel settled himself, as nearly comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able as an outlander may, on liis huge saddle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He caught the rough, sagging motion and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed his body, native fashion, to it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the only rider. The natives at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">early stage of the journey chose to plod afoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside their ungainly charges. Later, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desert sands should begin to burn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and the desert suns to play unholy</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricks with the eyes, they would be clamor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for their turn to climb atop the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly burdened of the brutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The owner, first removing from his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pair of vehemently scarlet slippers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slinging them over his shoulder for safety,</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his place at the head of the caravan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A tiny gray bell-donkcy pattered sturdil}</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his side--the donkey that is the mascot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the real guide, the highly important leader</seg><seg type="columnLine">of evenr Svrian caravan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Camels* may bolt, may sulk, may go</seg><seg type="columnLine">musth, may exhibit in any fifty ways an</seg><seg type="columnLine">artistic temperament that would make .1</seg><seg type="columnLine">prima donna seem stolid by comparison</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the "Tip" of the Rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">141</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, they usually do. At such times all</seg><seg type="columnLine">human power over them sinks into obscurity</seg><seg type="columnLine">compared to the control exerted by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one sober little gray donkey. The tinkle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its bell is more potent than the frenzied</seg><seg type="columnLine">howls of all the professional drivers in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islamlik.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kiel remembered, from his vice-consular</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, the case of a quasi-humorous Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can who had been haled to the Damascus</seg><seg type="columnLine">Serai!, on the grave accusation of Icsc-maj-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esfc, for propounding to his Syrian dragoman</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conundrum--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why is the Ottoman Empire like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">string of camels?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The answer, "Because it is led by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">donkey," had been taken by the dragoman</seg><seg type="columnLine">as of doubtful compliment to the Sultan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had so reported it, and Judge Gregg</seg><seg type="columnLine">had needed all the influence of the consulate</seg><seg type="columnLine">to clear the ribald one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kiel, familiar with the surrounding coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try, knew to an inch where the caravan</seg><seg type="columnLine">would rest for the night. He knew, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the present jolting would be of short</seg><seg type="columnLine">duration, since, whether a caravan starts</seg><seg type="columnLine">at dawn or at dusk, its first day's journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">i.s precisely forty furlongs--no more nor less</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and it has been so from the birth of history,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for what cause no living man knows, any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than it is known why the universal</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of all camel caravans is gaged to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second at sixteen furlongs an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wherefore, by Kiel's calculations, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night's rest would occur a hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the Tomb of Assad, five miles from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Square of the Caravans, and the halt</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be called in just two and one-half</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours from the time of starting. It was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent a premature halt that the start</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been delayed until after the late after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon call to prayer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The forecast was wholly correct, as fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casts involving Eastern customs--but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eastern temperaments--are more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasonably certain to be. Just beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomb the camels were made to kneel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, still laden, they were left for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night while fires were lighted and food pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared.	r</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His labors and his vocal efforts momen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarily ended, the caravan owner looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">about for his passenger, with whom he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided, dunng the five-mile walk, to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a most interesting and profitable conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was barely in time to see Kiel walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing slowly awa}r from the firelight radius</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the starry darkness, to southward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bundle over his back. That a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">should needlessly cany any burden was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the grasp of the owner's Oriental</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, and he inferred that Kiel, stretching</seg><seg type="columnLine">his legs after the ride, had feared to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bundle behind lest it be looted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The incident gave the Syrian a desirable</seg><seg type="columnLine">peg whereon to hang his carefully prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"OH£, Ellendi!" he hailed Moylan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The latter moved on without</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning. The pursuer's short legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were put to their best to catch up the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senger two hundred yards away from camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does this mean?" raged the cara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">van owner, in a rage not wholly made to</seg><seg type="columnLine">order, when at length he ranged alongside</seg><seg type="columnLine">his quarry.

After nine o'clock the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hERm w ire I ess was busy. I could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crackle of the juice as it leaped through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spark gap, even in the engine-room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once, when I had climbed the ladder for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a breath of fresh air, I saw the nimble Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Todd dance up the bridge ladder with a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patch in his hand. IS I r. Podd was evident-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly in high spirits again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Courtney was also abroad. He bobbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the chart-house, grabbed the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patch from Podd's hand, and bobbed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. From these signs I concluded that</seg><seg type="columnLine">theOrw.v&amp;ywas approaching her destination.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The watch passed slowly. My thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwelt constantly upon the little man crouch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the life-boat, and upon the conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion I had had with him. What was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game? Would Mr. Dooin's vague fears</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove well-founded? Was the Ormsby other</seg><seg type="columnLine">than she seemed?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                         144</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I had no trouble with the men. In fact,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my evil-looking gang worked their heads off:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and if they didn't exactly look as if they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enjoyed it, they took good care that none</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of their muttering reached my ears. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there was a good deal of clandestine whis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pering among them, and about them an air</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of expectancy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And when I was relieved and went on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deck at noon, I saw and felt the same ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pectancy and suppressed excitement in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rest of the crew. The deck crowd no longer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sprawled about the forehatches: they stood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about in groups. Through the cabin door 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saw Doctor Farley and Raider in close com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">munion. Upon the bridge Henderson stood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in earnest conversation with the man at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wheel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I clambered to the boat skids on the star-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">board side, and got into communication</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with Dooin. 1 saw that the canvas cover-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing on the life-boat had been slit for a tew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inches near the stern. An air-hole! I leaned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">carelessly across the gunwale, pretended to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">searching the sea and whispered to the rent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gold at Sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">145</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you there?

They stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking whenever I draw near."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, keep your eyes skinned. Mosey</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and maybe those sports will let you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear or see something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I "moseyed" around. I went up on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge and interrupted the tete-a-tete be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween Henderson and the man at the wheel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They stopped talking as soon as I hove in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight, but I knew that it was not because</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hot Scotch was abashed that I had discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered him gossiping with a forecastle hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He met me with a smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Mac, how's things below?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well enough," I replied. "What's our</seg><seg type="columnLine">position?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," he lied; I knew he lied</seg><seg type="columnLine">because I had seen him and Dacy taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun as I came off watch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell that to a marine," I told him. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you don't want to answer a civil question,</seg><seg type="columnLine">say so--don't lie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't get sore, Mac," he grinned. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">got an awful poor memory for figures this</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip--I was advised to have."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stepped into the chart-house. Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dacy was stretched upon the couch, read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; Courtney was seated at the table, po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring over a dispatch, and consulting a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">book at his right hand; a code book, evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hello, Chief!" exclaimed Dacy. "Did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have any trouble with the watch this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," I told him.

His shoulders twitched con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How are you, Mr. Podd. Have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">definitely decided upon your particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">French Red Devil?" I inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Mr. McMeal," he answered hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pily, "I have discovered that one must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have family traditions.

"Kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague if need arose and we were able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">send a wireless. Anything else?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told him about Podd, the wireless man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I think he is crazy, but not too crazy,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 said.

"Say, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship isn't armed, is she?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I thought of that--privateering or</seg><seg type="columnLine">something like that. But the old tub is s.j</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow she couldn't catch a brick-scow."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well," remarked Dooin, "we'll just have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to await developments. Something is rot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We talked a little while longer, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked me particularly about Podd.

There was not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a ring of packing or a valve in place in either</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pump; the bonnets were off and the nuts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scattered, the rods were lying upon the floor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plates. The busy Mr. Johnson, in a few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hours of bungling, had caused damage that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would take most of the night to repair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I was furious, and cursed him roundly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He smiled philosophically and answered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nothing. I w'as so angry that I failed to re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mark upon the strangeness of any engineer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">doing such a thing. Then, my tongue hav-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing eased my mind a bit, I started to work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We were soon tied up to the man-o'-war;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Johnson was receiving bells from the bridge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">even before I started to work. As soon as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the rattle of the deck winches apprised us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">below that the stores were being transferred,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Johnson quietly disappeared, without even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">offering to help me. I was quite content to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have turn go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I pressed the watch into service, and af-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ter a fifteen-minute trial, during which they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deliberately undid all I accomplished, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drove them away. Then I sweated and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swore and labored alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Captain Dacy came down, and with him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was a youngish man in the undress uniform</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of an officer of the British Navy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This is Captain Montague, of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Wasp," said Dacy to me. "Captain Mon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tague, this is my chief engineer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Captain Montague inclined his head in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my direction a frigid half-inch. In return I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gave him a nod that was as curt, and con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tinued with my work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We have been working upon the pumps</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ever since we left New York," glibly ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plained Dacy, "We had hoped to have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them ready by the time we came up with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you, but there was too much to be done</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon them. But McNeil assures me that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they will be in operation before morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I should hope so. My word, they must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be!" exclaimed the Englishman.' "We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">haven't enough oil in our tanks to last us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">two hours' steaming, and we must be away</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'll have them running by midnight," I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">told him. "Two hours' pumping will fill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Captain Montague was much relieved,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and his face cleared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "1 hat will do very well." said he. "I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not care so long as I get my fuel by day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. It is safe enough to lay by you this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair weather, and I will admit that all of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">14-8</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">will relish a few consecutive hours' sleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My ship is a poor place for rest when under</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. If you like, Mr. Engineer, I will send</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a couple of my artificers to lend you</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, thank you," I answered hastily. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can make out very well alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had no desire to have a couple of super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cilious navy men working at my elbow. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Englishman did not press his offer, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I was grateful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He and Dacy stood there talking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time; Dacy lying volubly, and pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">testing that we had been laboring night and</seg><seg type="columnLine">day upon recalcitrant pumps since leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">port. Dacy's readiness to lie to save his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face surprised me; 1 had not thought him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that kind of man. But it was none of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">business, and I kept my mouth shut. Fi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nally they departed and left me alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I kept my promise to have the pumps in</seg><seg type="columnLine">running condition by midnight. Then, as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certaining through the speaking-tube from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridge that everything at the other end</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in readiness, I started the oil into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">war-ship's tanks. I set an oiler to watch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pumps, and dirty, tired and hungry, climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had intended to communicate with Doo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, but found no opportunity for doing so</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately. Henderson met me at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine-room door and escorted me forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown garrulous of a sudden, and regaling</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with an off-color story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The destroyer was lying by our star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board side, dark and quiet. Our own decks</seg><seg type="columnLine">were black, the stores evidently all trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred. I looked over the rail at the war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship; but beyond a few dim forms visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her bridge, her decks seemed deserted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson stuck at my side, and seeing no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to reach Dooin just then, I entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dacy, Farley and Podd were in the cabin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dacy greeted me effusively, complimented</seg><seg type="columnLine">me upon a task well done and offered me</seg><seg type="columnLine">the use of his own bath in which to clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. Farley smiled upon me ingratiatingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and informed me that he had saved a hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinner for me. Podd grinned vacantly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveyed the impression that the sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me gave him unalloyed delight, Henderson</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued his reminiscences. It seemed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if all were now cultivating me even as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had before avoided me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was too dirty and hungry to take much</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest iu anything save a bath and sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per, for the time being. I enjoyed the cu{&gt;-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain's tub, and then sat down to the appe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tizing mess the big negro, Turk, brought me</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the galley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      WHILE I ate, I became acutely con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of the peculiar bearing of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions. Farley paced nervously</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down the cabin; Henderson was</seg><seg type="columnLine">absurdly loquacious; Podd said nothing, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat tensely on the edge of a chair, his bulging</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes glistening with excitement. Only IJucy</seg><seg type="columnLine">was calm, he sat with immobile face, a cigar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stump clamped between his jaws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From their demeanor, I gained the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression that something was about to hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pen. What, I did not know, could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess. Who could have guessed the truth?</seg><seg type="columnLine">But my liveliest curiosity was aroused, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a measure I was placed upon my guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Captain Montague was well pleased</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the pumps started," remarked Dacy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He has turned in with the rest of bis crew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poor chaps, they have a hard time at sea in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that class of ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I noticed her dc-cks darkened as I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward," I responded. "Isn't Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montague taking quite a chance--leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">his vessel practically unguarded, at sea. and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in wartime?''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No danger," answered Dacy. "He has</seg><seg type="columnLine">posted an anchor watch, and all lights are</seg><seg type="columnLine">doused both upon the	and upon us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His men could turn out at a moment s no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She is a mighty long way from a safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">base," I commented. "A destroyer doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually operate alone, so far from a home</seg><seg type="columnLine">port."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Wasp is one of a new type, said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dacy. "She has a steaming radius of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand eight hundred miles with oil fuel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a speed of thirty-six knots when driven.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She is from Halifax, and has been cruising</seg><seg type="columnLine">off New York for a couple of weeks. She is</seg><seg type="columnLine">better for commerce destroying than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger vessel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Where is Courtney?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mr. Podd jumped nervously at the ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and glanced at Farley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Gone to bed," said Farley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Where I am going directly,' I answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am tired."	„</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Have a nip of schnapps before you go,</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Dacy. ' Farley, there is a bottle upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sideboard."	...</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Farley stepped to the sideboard behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gold at Sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">149</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I noticed Todd watching him, mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">agape. Aroused, 1 directed my eyes to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror hanging on the wall in front of me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In die mirror, I saw Farley pick up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle and pour out the drink. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast a quick look at my back, drew a tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle from his breast-pocket and passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands across the top of the glass intend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed for me. It was all done in a flash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here you are, Chief," said Farley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Prime Kentucky stuff--do you good!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He handed the doctored glass to me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">took it, stood up and looked him square in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eye. Such was the man's effrontery he</seg><seg type="columnLine">never blinked an eye, though he must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known from my look that I knew what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His aplomb touched the tinder to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">choler. I dashed the drink into his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took him by the throat. I thrust my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand into his breast-pocket and whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the phial. It was unlabeled, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contents a colorless liquid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You little crook!" I cried, shaking him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What do you mean by drugging my</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He struggled futilely, and I tightened my</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutch on his windpipe. Then he was tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my grasp, and I found myself strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling desperately with Dacy and Hender-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son who had flung themselves upon me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I downed Henderson with a blow on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw, and wrestled furiously in the iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp of Captain Dacy. He was a stronger</seg><seg type="columnLine">man even than I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard rushing feet on the deck without,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in answer to his low, sharp cry. Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarmed into the cabin. I was seized from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind and my arms pinioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had happened so quickly--my anger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its consequences--that I was dazed." I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made an effort to continue the struggle, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found myself powerless to move. My arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">were twisted behind me, and strong, expert</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands clutched my wrists.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don t disable him," I heard Dacy say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I subsided and twisted my head around.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ihe cabin was filled; a half-dozen men had</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered Daev's cry. Henderson was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">picking himself up from the floor, nursing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jaw with both hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stared at the men, and my jaw dropped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hey were my own crowd, men of the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang. My assistant, Johnson, led them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an&lt;l in his hand he bore a naked sword.</seg><seg type="columnLine">About each man's middle was strapped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cart 1 idge belt and a brace of revolvers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stared, and there came to me a light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning comprehension of the stunning truth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I opened my mouth to shout a warning, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream at the top of my voice a message</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Dooin in the life-boat. and mayhap the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship beside us, would hear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the men behind me crooked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm around my throat and choked my</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gag him!" I heard Dacy exclaim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My head wTas roughly drawn back. Into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mouth was forced the gag--a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cork wrapped with a napkin, I soon discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered. The ends of the thing were drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly across my cheeks and knotted to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether at the back of my neck. I was help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less; I could not utter a sound; for a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments I could hardly breathe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A low'-voiced conversation was going on</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind me, in which I made out Dacy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice but could overhear nothing. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was roughly urged ahead by the men be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We traversed the cabin, the cabin alley-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and emerged on deck. I was choking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was a buzzing in my head. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only half-conscious that numerous figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded me. I was shoved and dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the deck to the side of the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you got them?" I heard a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, here they are!" came the answer in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farley's voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My arms were jerked from behind me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forced around a stanchion in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I felt the touch of cold steel upon my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists, and heard a click. My captors un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed me and stepped away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instinctively, I jerked my arms apart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They came some three inches. I was hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuffed to the stanchion!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pleasant thoughts, Mr. McNeil!" came</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farley's level, venomous voice in my ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I heard retreating footsteps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IX</seg><seg type="columnLine">I WAS helpless. The stanchion I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shackled to was one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge supports--an iron "I," fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten inches wide. By twisting my head, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see for some distance along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ormsby's deck, both fore and aft; and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisting my body and stretching my neck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could also peer around the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stanchion and down upon the destroyer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">decks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The gag l»urt me cruelly. I tried, but un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">successfully, to reach my head around the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stanchion so that my jaws and lingers would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">meet. I bit and chewed frantically upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the cork, in my mouth, and only succeeded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in giving myself pain. 1 was panic-stricken</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the thought of the deed about to happen,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and of my utter inability to warn the sleep-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing ship that lay before me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then ! became still and waited with hor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ror and despair for the thing to happen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Stealthy footsteps passed and repassed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">behind me. It was a dark night, bright</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with stars, but moonless. Not a light was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">showing upon either ship. The Ormsby's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bulk, towering above the Wasp, threw the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">latter's decks into black shadow. But, by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">twisting my head, I could make out many</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dim, moving shapes upon our own decks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dacy's whole hell-crew was stirring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  From the bridge of the Wasp came the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sound of the bell. Four bells--two o'clock!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">From the destroyer's forecastle came the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gruff, subdued hail, "Four bells, and all-1's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">well!" and from the bridge, the boyish</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">treble of the midshipman's response, "All's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">well!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I heard Dacy's voice behind me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We must strike now!

"Take your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gang and get to work upon the engines,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">directed Dacy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The group moved away forward. Di-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rectly, a group of men crept aft. As they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">passed me I saw that they bore coils of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rope and Jacob's ladders. They strung</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">along the rail--dim blots in the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I heard Dacy's guarded voice again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Remember, light up at the sound of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whistle!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Avc, aye, sir," was the murmured re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sponse.

I he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">voice trailed away in a choking gurgle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A chorus of veils, answered by spitting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flames and the* crash of revolver shots, a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scream, and then a shrill whistle sounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Instantly* the Wasp's decks were bathed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in bright 'light along their entire length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Onnsbv's searchlight was trained upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Wasp's after quarter. The Wasp s own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">two searchlights lighted the amidship sec-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion and the forecastle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">What happened, happened so quietly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that I could hardly grasp it. When the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lights went on. the destroyer s decks were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crowded with ihe Ormsby's men. A group</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were engaged in clamping shut the door to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gold at Sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crew's quarters, forward, and some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were shooting through the port-holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the helpless men inside. Other groups</seg><seg type="columnLine">were disappearing down the fire-room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine-room hatches. A third gang, among</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom was Dacy, tumbled down the after</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatch that opened to the officers' quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pandemonium! From the forecastle came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yells of the imprisoned men, answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by revolver shots. From the engine-room</seg><seg type="columnLine">came cries and shots, and the long-drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">shriek of a man going out in agony. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the after hatch, down which Dacy had gone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came more shots and shouts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of that after hatch came a pajama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad figure--the unfortunate Captain Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tague. He carried a dispatch-box in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, and ran toward the side of the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was wounded and staggered as he ran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A streak of flame burst from the yawning</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatch. Montague dropped the box, threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his hands and fell forward upon his face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Out of the hatch leaped Farley, smoking re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver in hand. He ran to Montague's side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pounced upon the dispatch-box.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The uproar ceased as abruptly as it com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced, save that the men in the forecastle</seg><seg type="columnLine">still howled, and the gang without still shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the port-holes that opened aft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of the cabin hatch came two pajama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad figures, guarded by revolver-armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Then came Dacy, and following him</seg><seg type="columnLine">four men who carried two limp bodies. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">four staggered to the side with their ghast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly burdens and threw them into the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A gang commenced to collect the bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered about the deck--the bodies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montague, and of the anchor-watch. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed horror-struck. I counted twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashes as the sea received the murdered</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead. Out of the engine-room came more</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, prisoners and guards, and men carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing limp burdens which they gave to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea. I counted twelve splashes, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure there were more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dacy gave some orders. The Ormsby's</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchlight was switched from the Wasp's</seg><seg type="columnLine">after deck to the Ormsby's foredeck. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang of men, under Raider's command, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarded the Ormsby. They went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lorehatch and removed a section of the cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering Then, with drawn weapons, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched along the rail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then commenced the transference of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners. The pa jama-clad officers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men taken in the engine and fire-rooms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were made to climb the ladder to the Orms-</seg><seg type="columnLine">by's deck. They were forced to descend into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forehold. When they had disappeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hatch section was replaced and Raider s</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd stood guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On board the Wasp a parley took place</seg><seg type="columnLine">between Dacy and the men imprisoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the forecastle compartment. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">forecastle door opened a scant ways, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung outward, and three of the Wasp's</seg><seg type="columnLine">men squeezed through. The door was slam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">med and fastened behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three were compelled to board the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ormsby and descend into the forehold, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same manner as their shipmates. Safe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly in the hold, and the hatch replaced over</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heads, the word was passed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd upon the Wasp. The forecastle door</seg><seg type="columnLine">was opened again, three more men emerged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the whole process was repeated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this manner the Wasp's crew was</seg><seg type="columnLine">transferred. Fifty-one men came out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that forecastle, in groups of three. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no chance to resist. They were sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by armed men from the instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">they reached the Wasp's deck until the}'</seg><seg type="columnLine">were safely belowr in the Ormsby's forehold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">pPM SUCH was the taking of the TT'&lt;*sp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        Poor Montague has been charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with carelessness, and his men with</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowardice. Neither charge is true. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">men w'ere given no chance to organize re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistance; they were completely surprised.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And how could Montague have suspected</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger from the rusty old supply ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought to his side by a representative of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own Government?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Wasp had been three weeks at sea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To one who knows nothing of torpedo-boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">or destroyers, this may not appear signifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cant. It really means that for twenty-one</seg><seg type="columnLine">days the men on the ir&lt;z5/&gt; had been sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisting upon pick-up lunches and contenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves with cat-naps of rest. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">over-engined shells are nerve-racking, tiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">places to live in at sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Wasp's complement had been de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted through the dispatch of prize crews.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When she sighted the Ormsby that after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon, she had but seventy-three officers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">men aboard. They had been standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch and watch for weeks, and all hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">were tired out. In merely posting an an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chor-w'atch, and allowing the rest of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew to obtain a night's sleep, Montague</seg><seg type="columnLine">did what any officer with his men's well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">being and comfort at heart would have done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor would it have made much difference</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had a full watch been on duty. Dacy's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crowd would have still outnumbered them,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the surprise would have been just as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">complete. It might have cost Dacy a few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more lives, but he cared nothing for that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As it was, he lost just one man--slain by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Montague as the latter leaped from his bed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">during the invasion of the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Wasp's build laid her open to just</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">such an attack. There are no deck-houses</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or other obstructions on a destroyer's decks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Abaft the bridge, on the Wasp, only the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">three funnels and the square hatches broke</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the llush decks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The forecastle was high, and broke at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beam. Beneath the forecastle head the en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tire crew berthed. There was but the one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">door. The rest of the ship was compart-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ments. A destroyer is just a box of com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">partments. There was no communication</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">between them save through the little square</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hatches in the deck. There were no doors</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">below decks--just sheer steel bulkheads, iso-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lating each section.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dacy knew destroyers. He knew how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Wasp was constructed. He knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the steel door to the forecastle closed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the major portion of the crew would be im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoned. He knew he had then only to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckon with the few men in the isolated fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms, the men in the engine-room, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">few officers in the cabin. The capture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Wasp was planned beforehand down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the least detail, and the plot was daringly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ruthlessly executed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">fZSA THROUGHOUT it all I stood at</seg><seg type="columnLine">/fig, the Ormsby's rail, handcuffed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stanchion, a horrified and fascinated</seg><seg type="columnLine">witness to the scene. The audacity of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">act was stunning; the butchery that accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panied it nauseating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I am not a squeamish person; I have seen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">many men go out, with boots on and with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">boots off. I, myself, have sent a couple</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">across the line--but in fair fight, and for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">good cause. The heartless, cold-blooded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thoroughness with which Dacy knifed and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pistoled his way to victory sickened and en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">raged me. I struggled with my bonds, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bit impotently upon my gag.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My eyes were riveted upon the Wasp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but my thoughts would fly to the lile-boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the skids above my head. Dooin!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where was Dooin? Why did he not do</seg><seg type="columnLine">something? And then a glimmer of cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason would touch me. Dooin! What</seg><seg type="columnLine">could he do? Doubtless the little secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent was crouching overhead, as unwilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spectator as I to the scene, and as power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less to intervene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Wasp's men were all safely herded</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the forehold of the Ormsby, and Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Dacy 's voice sounded from Lhe destroy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er's deck in crisp orders. The gang tlew to</seg><seg type="columnLine">obey. A number of them rushed below Lo</seg><seg type="columnLine">the U\;s/&gt;'s engine-room and lire-rooms, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon 1 heard the hum and the roar as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oil fires were increased beneath the boilers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  •'Get that Englishman in the chart-house</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chuck him into the hold!" came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Wasp's deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Some of Raider's men left the foredeck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came aft, climbed to the chart-house, 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reappeared Jugging an unconscious j</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. They carried him forward, and as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">they moved into the glare of the searchlight j</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw that they carried Courtney's inani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate form. Poor Courtney, he had par- |</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken of Farley's mixture, no doubt!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They carried him to the forehatch &lt;nd</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered him into the hold. Then the hatch 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">section was replaced for the last time, a ,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy tarpaulin was drawn over the hatch j</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the battens were placed and hammered j</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Werner!" came Dacy's hail from the j</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately came the Germans reply j</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Ormsby's engine-room door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "7j, here! I vas ready!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Then come aboard here and prepare to j</seg><seg type="columnLine">get under way!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "/a. I leave vun man to smash der dy- j</seg><seg type="columnLine">name!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Johnson, or rather. Werner, slid down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Wasp's deck. He spoke with Dacy for j</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, and then disappeared into the _</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wasp's engine-room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Get the boxes with the uniforms!" or- ;</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered Dacy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  From the Ormsbv's forecastle were handed 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">two big packing-boxes. They were hoisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the rail and lowered to the H asp s deck, fl</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they were seized and whisked away -</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the latter's forecastle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bring McNeil aboard!	^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men approached me. Farley s voice I</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke in my ear.	. , j</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, McNeil, I hope you enjoyed the ;</seg><seg type="columnLine">entertainment!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The handcuffs that bound me to the stan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chion were unlocked and removed, and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gold at Sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">153</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbed arms fell to my sides. With a gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">tickling my ribs, I was forced to clamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rail, and slide, rather than climb, down</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Jacob's ladder to the Wasp's deck. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">urged across the deck to the cabin hatch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently I found myself between decks</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lighted passageway of the officers'</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters. It was a fore-and-aft passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">with doors opening on either side. I caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a glimpse of a vista of disordered rooms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of a great, ugly, black splotch on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carpet underfoot. One of my guards flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">open a door, I was thrown into one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms and the door was slammed and locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">X</seg><seg type="columnLine">I UNKNOTTED the napkins and</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed the gag from my mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I spat the cork out thankfully, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked about for water. My throat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">raw and my tongue swollen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a desk before me, with a water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle upon it. It was empty. I searched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the bottom drawer of the desk I dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered a siphon of soda and a bottle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I guzzled the soda, and it brought relief</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my tortured mouth. I also took a stiff</seg><seg type="columnLine">jolt of the liquor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was in an officer's berth. The bunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in wild disorder, and trailing blankets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and overturned chairs gave evidence of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">recent struggle. But there were no blood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stains about, and I decided that the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">had belonged to one of the pajama-ciad</seg><seg type="columnLine">men now imprisoned on board the Ormsby.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I set aright one of the chairs, fell into it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried to think.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before my eyes flashed the scene 1 had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just witnessed--the attack, the surprise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slaughter, and the stream of prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">descending into the forehold. Piracy!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bloody piracy! What did it mean? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">great war furnished a pregnant and obtru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive background to the picture. Was it pi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">racy? There was Werner! Was it all part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a carefully planned German plot?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked at my watch -- four - thirty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">three hours and a half had elapsed since</seg><seg type="columnLine">1' arley attempted to drug me in the Orms-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oy j cabin. It seemed an age.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could not think clearly. I heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumping of heavy feet upon the steel plates</seg><seg type="columnLine">over my head, and I reflected dully that</seg><seg type="columnLine">daylight must be breaking. But I had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy enough to turn my head to the port-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole. Physical weariness, mental reaction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the soporific effect of the whisky I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">drank, all weighed upon me. I stumbled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feet, threw myself upon the crumpled</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunk and was asleep instantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I slept hours, though it seemed but a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment until I opened my eyes, refreshed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Wasp was under way. The vibration,</seg><seg type="columnLine">omnipresent upon such craft, brought a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhythmic tremor from even,- plate and beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rivet. The glow of sunlight diffused</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the room whenever the port-hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted above the racing waters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I rolled out and tried the door. Locked!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was still a prisoner. I looked at my watch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nine-thirty! I had slept a full five hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sat dowrn in the chair and again re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viewed the events of the past night. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I brought a freshened brain to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">task, and though my plight was pressing I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could find no answer to the riddle. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">twentieth-century piracy? Nonsensical!</seg><seg type="columnLine">A German plot? There was but one Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the crowd, and he a subordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nate!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I realized now what my value was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Dacy and his crowd. I understood now</seg><seg type="columnLine">his queries as to my mechanical ability, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pleasure in discovering that I was fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliar with torpedo-boat engines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was in the hands of a desperate gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">who held human life cheaply--the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given gruesome proof of that. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no bright spot in the gloom of the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. I did not doubt that they would snuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">me out in an instant if I opposed them. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must go easy; I must pretend to fall in with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their wishes; I must not lose my temper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My life depended upon it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Dooin were only at my side! I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">faith that the little detective would And</seg><seg type="columnLine">means to rip the bloody net that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">meshed in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But where was Dooin? On board the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ormsby, if alive--perhaps his bod)' too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swirled in the depths! The Ormsby.' Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the Ormsby now?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My gloomy meditations were abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">terminated by the rat tling of the door-knob.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lock clicked and the door opened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sailor, wearing the blouse of a British</seg><seg type="columnLine">Navy bluejacket, and with a cutlass and</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver belted about his waist, confronted</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. He spoke and 1 recognized him--it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Worden. He stared at me with a ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">levolent eye, but saluted with perfect grav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity and spoke meekly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">154</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Captain Dacy would like to see you, sir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I am to take you to him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 followed him into the passageway. As</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I traveled the length of the passage, I saw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that it bisected the officers' quarters. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">berths were to starboard, the wardroom and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pantry to port. The ladder to the deck</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was at the forward end of the passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Worden led me up the ladder to the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I paused for a moment and swept the sea</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a wide-circling gaze. Not a sail or a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">smoke-smudge in sight, or any sign of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ormsby! The Wasp was alone on the sea,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dashing northward, I judged by the sun,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and at a good twenty-five knots. The sea</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was calm, yet the lift was such that I could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hardly keep my balance; and the plates</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">under my feet trembled like aspens from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the vibration of the engines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We went forward and mounted to the lit-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tle bridge the Wasp sported. Worden mo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tioned for me to enter the tiny chart-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      DACY was seated at a table, an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">open dispatch-box at his elbow, por-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing over a queer-looking book--a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">book with sheets of lead for covers. This</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was the prize that the wounded Captain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Montague had endeavored to give to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sea just before Farley killed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In the corner of the room was a second</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">table, and upon it the wireless apparatus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Podd was seated there, also bent over a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">book--his beloved Bambers, I had no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">doubt. He lifted a lugubrious countenance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as I appeared, got to his feet and departed,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">giving me a blank stare as he passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Dacy looked up. Gone were the pleasant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> smile and amiable manners. This was an-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> other Dacyf, the true Dacy. His face was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> stern, his cold, inscrutable eyes drilled into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> me. He was the forceful leader I had sensed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> him to be from the first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Well, McNeil," he said, "I suppose you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> wish to know what all this means?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Yes," I answered.

There</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> is money in it--big money!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    "It is bloody piracy!" I exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "If you will be reasonable, McNeil, you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> will be rolling in wealth within a week.

I would not like to add to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">number.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The threat was not lost upon me. So</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nineteen men had died the night before!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What do you want of me?" I demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I want you to be my chief engineer--a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">job of a different caliber from the one you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had upon the Ormsby."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I want nothing to do with it!" I cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I do not care to hang!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You have no choice," he said gravely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"If we hang, you hang. When they learn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of this affair ashore, you will be mentioned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as one of the leaders."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What!" I exclaimed. "I one of your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gang? Why, I wras shanghaied!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I will be frank with you, McNeil. You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are implicated as deeply as any of us. Your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">name was forged upon the Ormsby's arti-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cles, and--do you recall that when you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came to yourself upon the Ormsby you re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">marked upon the odor of alcohol on your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bunk and upon your clothes?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes," I said, startled. "Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We poured whisky upon you for a pur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pose.

They had deliberately placed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me in a false light before a man who hated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me--an influential man who would cheer-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fully take oath as to my desperate charac-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ter. Lieutenant Haun of the Beaver was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the man I had tricked when the Coboy w^as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wrecked, as Haffner well knew.

I asked.

With the Ormsby above</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'ater, Dooin was alive!

With Dooin behind me, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was small danger of my being branded as</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of these gallows-birds. But I showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of my elation to Dacy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," I said, "what is your game, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what do I get out of it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, that is sensible of you to take it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that spirit," he replied. "You are to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take charge of the Wasp's engine-room; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">your share of the expedition will amount to</seg><seg type="columnLine">about two hundred thousand dollars."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Huh! Fine promises!" I retorted. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be flying high for a newly born pirate!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is no scoffing matter," he frowned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You realize that it has been serious enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far. We are taking a big chance for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big prize. We are after gold amounting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve millions of dollars.

I demanded; somehow, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew he was speaking the truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will know that in due time," w'as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his response.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, good Goa, man!"

"A life is but a small thing, McNeil.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A fortune is a fortune."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shivered at the easy finality of his tone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He meant the words.

I knew he wTould remove me, if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it necessary, with as little com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">punction as he would show to an insect</seg><seg type="columnLine">that crossed his path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'll run your engines," I said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but I do it under protest.

Keep the engines running, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you w'ill not be expected to assist us in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ~~jjj WHEN I left the chart-room, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> found that the freedom of the ship</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  --	was mine. I had half expected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentle Worden to attach himself to me as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">permanent escort; but apparently no watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">was set upon my movements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Raider had the watch, but he gave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">no other attention than a black look. I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned it with interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I ranged about the decks to obtain a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of the ship. The U'u5/&gt; was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the large cruising type of destroyers, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped by naval constructors during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past half-dozen years. I had noticed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brass plate on the chart-room bulkhead that</seg><seg type="columnLine">show'ed her to be less than a year in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission. She was about two thousand tons</seg><seg type="columnLine">displacement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her batten' consisted of four torpedo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes, two aft and two forward, and six</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid-fire guns of the standard British 4.7</seg><seg type="columnLine">type, arranged three to a side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A group of four men were working upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the guns, and they worked as if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood their business. They were be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing bossed by the navy deserter I had no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticed at the wheel of the Ormsby--the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the gunner's mate's rating upon liis</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeve.	'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Evidently," 1 thought, "Dacy has or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ganized his crew' upon a man-o'-war basis</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rated petty officers." A true guess, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon discovered. The gang had left their</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefree, work-be-danined manner upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ormsby; prompt, unquestioning obedience</seg><seg type="columnLine">to orders was the rule upon the Wasp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I looked about the deck for evidences of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the previous night's fury; but the decks had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been cleaned, and there were no traces of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the fight. Finally, I dropped through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">engine-room hatch, and presently found my-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">self at the bottom of the engine-room lad-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">der, gazing about me with satisfied ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proval.	#</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I do not think any engineer could have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stilled a glow of contentment upon survey-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing the Wasp's engine-room. It was a vi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sion of cleanliness and order, of bright steel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and gleaming brass. The big casings that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enclosed the turbines were clean and glis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tening; a couple of oilers scurried about,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">alive to their work; the mingled odor of hot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">oil and grease and working steel met my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nostrils pleasantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Johnson stood erect between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twin throttles, and as I crossed to him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted me with a smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Goot morning, Chief!" His mild blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye twinkled. "I hope you got der pumps</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Say!" I exclaimed, of a sudden thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Did you dismantle those pumps purposely,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yesterday afternoon?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "/a,"'he admitted easily. "It vas or-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ders."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I saw another clever move in the plot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The dismantling of the Ormsby's pumps had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">kept the Wasp beside the other ship, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">also had kept me from witnessing or inter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fering with any of the preparations for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Well, Mr. Johnson," I said, "I suppose,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like the rest of the crowd, you are hugely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pleased with last night's exploit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Nod Johnson, Mr. McNeil!

"I strike</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for der Vatcrland!

I thought for an in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stant he would attempt to strike me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You insult me! You make me vun of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dese." He waved his hand scornfully to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clude the whole ship. "I care nod--your</seg><seg type="columnLine">words vas wrong. Yes, I help dem ged der</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold! It is for der Vatcrland I do it--it vas</seg><seg type="columnLine">British gold!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Where is the gold?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "If you nod know, I tell you nodding,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he answered with a return to his accustomed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">phlegm. "You vas trying to pump me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--I say no more. Yen will you relieve</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Soon," I told him curtly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I left the German and took a trip about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the engines. She was a sweet sight for a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">discriminating eye--two big turbines for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">going ahead and' a third, and smaller ^-et,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for going astern. I saw the reason now for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dacy's interest in turbines. Everything</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was new and spick and span. I made the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mental resolve that as long as I was com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pelled- to take charge of the department,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the men would toe the mark and keep the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beauties in their present condition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I mounted to the deck and descended</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the different fire-rooms. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">six of them, one for each boiler. In each I</seg><seg type="columnLine">encountered the same things--the boiler</seg><seg type="columnLine">steaming, the oil fires carefully tended,</seg><seg type="columnLine">three men alert and competent in the per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formance of their duties. No need now to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder why the Ormsby was overmanned!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At last I returned to the officers quar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ters, and my room, as I already thought of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the room in which I had been imprisoned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">1	was still clad in the grimy clothes I had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">labored in the night before. I searched for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and found some clean dungarees, and don-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ned them.	.	«</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As I left the room again, and stepped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into the passageway, the door of the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gold at vSea</seg><seg type="columnLine">157</seg><seg type="columnLine">next to mine opened and Mr. Podd stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We were face to face, but Podd looked at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me with unseeing eyes. When I had seen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him in the chart-room, a short time before,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his face had borne the look of one who was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suffering acutely. Now, the deep lines were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">smoothed from his haggard face; his eyes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">w'ere alight, a fixed smile was upon his bps,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and he gazed straight at me and was un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">conscious of my presence. He seemed to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be in a happy trance. I gave him "good-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">morning/' but he stalked silently to the lad-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">der and disappeared out on deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When he had gone I noticed Farley stand-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing in the ward-room entrance, evidently</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drawn there by the sound of my voice. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">regarded me with a smile that was akin to a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sneer, and gave me a hail, meant to be jo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vial perhaps, which rasped my nerves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Ha, McNeil!" he cried. ' "Would you</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a little nip of schnapps?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I jumped to his side. I felt that some of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the steam bottled up inside of me must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blow off. I reached out and took him bv</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the throat.	J</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You little rat," I grated, "I've a good</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nnnd to wring your neck!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I meant no more than to frighten him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but some of my rancor and panic crept into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my finger-tips as I squeezed. He struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly, and a fearful look crept into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulging eyes. I released my grip, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank gaspmg to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It would serve you right if I killed you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you dirty murderer!"

I sensed keenly upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  what a slender thread my safety hung.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt fear for Dooin. I had given the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little man my friendship and liking, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of his probable condition was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheering. True, Dacy had said the Ormsby</seg><seg type="columnLine">was afloat, and Dooin was on the Ormsby.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But had Dacy spoken truth? I put nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond Dacy and his gang. Mayhap the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ormsby was scuttled, and Dooin'and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in the forehold now food for fishes! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been the safer course for Dacy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And with Dooin gone, what of my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">position? If I ever regained shore safely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what predicament would I find myself in?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Proscribed for murder and piracjr!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For Dacy had so arranged that I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be regarded as one of the gang. Perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in New York, I was already being called</seg><seg type="columnLine">pirate and murderer. My reputation with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the powers that be was none too sweet; I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a well-known filibuster. My wild tale</seg><seg type="columnLine">would gain no credence. I would not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed it from another man, myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I was not so much afraid of death; I had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">faced it often, and had been long enough at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sea to be something of a fatalist. But the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">contemplation of the gallows as a means oi</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">making my exit was disheartening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The wireless was talking overhead, crack-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ling and humming. Dac\' was talking to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some one over the rim of the sea--talking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the prize, no doubt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The prize! What was the prize? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly turning shafts sang it to me, "twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">million, twelve million, twelve million!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twelve million dollars--an unbelievable</seg><seg type="columnLine">sum. What ship would carry such treasure?</seg><seg type="columnLine">^et, I knew some ship did and that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">II	asp was coursing in her direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dacy was talking to her with the aid of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the British Navy's secret code-book that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">poor Montague had tried to sink in the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She must be a British ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> British gold! Before my mind's eve</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a picture of a West Street dock, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a huge motor-truck with a covered load</seg><seg type="columnLine">and four armed men perched atop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ''By heavens!" I cried. "It's the Maure-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">subia!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The M.auresub/al- It was three days now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">since I had stood before the dock gates on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">West Street. She was preparing for sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">then. She was loading treasure. It must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the Maurcsubia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the stunning audacity of it! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maurcsubia was a thirty-thousand-ton grey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hound. To hold her up and loot her was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible--unthinkable. Vet, such must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be Dacy's plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Thinking about the Maurcsubia and West</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street, it was perhaps but natural that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts should wander a bit. At any</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate, natural or not, they did. I forgot the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maurcsubia, the Wasp, and Dooin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dacy. Forgot I was the quasi-prisoner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a murderous band of thugs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three days! Had but three days passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">since I stood upon West Street and talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her--since I had seen her living face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard her voice? Was it three days since I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had met Mary Morrison? It seemed an age.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, I, Donald McNeil, bucko engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and woman-hater, stood for Heaven knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">how long, staring blankly at a piece of pol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished metal, my hands caressing a withered</seg><seg type="columnLine">flower I had taken from my bosom, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts mooning mistily about a lady fair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just like one of those driveling, sentimental</seg><seg type="columnLine">idiots you read about in books.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And* I found this occupation exceedingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant. So engrossed was I that I lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">all track of the time. The first intimation I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had that the hour for changing the watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">had arrived, was when Von Werner ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared at my elbow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Even then, I was not at first conscious of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his presence. I was endeavoring to settle</seg><seg type="columnLine">what appeared at the instant to be a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentous question--in what cheek did that</seg><seg type="columnLine">adorable dimple belong? The answer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">most elusive. Then I had it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Her right check, I'll bet my boots!" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ejaculated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then it was that a grunt of surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought me to my senses, and I turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover Von Werner at my elbow. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was regarding me with mild amusement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dey vas so pleasant dreams you baf,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he commented. "I speak dree times und</seg><seg type="columnLine">you never awake. You grin with joy der</seg><seg type="columnLine">while."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I returned his salutation grumpily. I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat sheepish to have been remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in such a pastime, even though the German</seg><seg type="columnLine">cculd have no inkling of my thoughts. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the watch over to him and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the ladder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Der captain vants to see you, Cruet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">he called to me. "He vas waiting in der</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward-room for you. He say for you to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him."</seg><seg type="columnLine">EtStI WAS late afternoon, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I entered the ward-room the giant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turk, was laying the table for sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per. Dacy was seated at the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, and Farley stood at his side talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At my entrance, the negro vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the door in the after wall that led</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the pantry. Farley hesitated an instant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then followed Turk, favoring me with a ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lignant glare through his glasses as he passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I was alone with the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "McNeil," he said abruptly, "I under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand that you assaulted the doctor this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. I gather you attempted to wring</seg><seg type="columnLine">his neck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He brought it upon himself," I an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered. "He knew no better than to taunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a raw-tempered man.

What sense is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in antagonizing your shipmates?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are no shipmates of mine!' I</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed. "I am glad if I have convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">them of the fact."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have," he said grimly. "There are</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen men on the ship who would delight</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bun- steel in you. Your hazing has given</seg><seg type="columnLine">you ill favor. .And you have made an enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Farley."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you warning me that mv life is in</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No. While I command, your life is safe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so long as you obey my orders.

I saia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, come, McNeil," he laughed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do not allow your resentment to sour</seg><seg type="columnLine">your disposition.

I suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sarcasm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. You might as well have the game</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the name, McNeil. Be sensible and join</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gold at Sea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">159</seg><seg type="columnLine">us and share in the loot.

It was an expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of hopeless despair, and his face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">furrowed with deep lines of suffering. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked utterly wretched</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What is the matter?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He shook his head dejectedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   McNeil, he said^ "did you ever have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">million maggots feasting upon your brain?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Did every atom of your being ever writhe</seg><seg type="columnLine">with desire?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I was too surprised by his strange words</seg><seg type="columnLine">to answer. He suddenly leaped to his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">( It you had ever felt it," he continued,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  you would know what hell is like."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He stood staring at me for an instant, his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  &lt;?&gt;7°rkin- ,lis shoulders twitching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   My God! My God!" he muttered in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">inward agony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly, he brushed past me and strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jroni the room. Then I heard the door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his room across the passage slam shut be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">11</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I had small thought to waste upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Podd's vagaries. I waited a short time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoping for the appearance of the new stew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard, and then went to my own room. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked about the room for a message, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found none. I threw myself into a chair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Dooin--surely it was Dooin! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was merely a disguise, the speech and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes. But how had he reached the Wasp?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where did he get the clothes? Why had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">not recognized me and at least tipped me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wink? No, it was no disguise, it was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect. But the name and the face!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So ran my mind. I happened to thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hand into my coat-pocket. I felt some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing hard and round, and I drew out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miniature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had forgotten about the picture, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">now as I regarded it my thoughts changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their direction abruptly. I gazed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">that dainty, smiling resemblance, and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubles faded from my consciousness. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was alone with Mary Morrison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her picture! How like, and yet how un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the beautiful, living face I remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">so well. Yes, even in this portrait a laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to tremble on the smiling lips, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eyes seemed fathomless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her picture! How came her picture into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dacy's hands--he a black-hearted criminal</seg><seg type="columnLine">with murder on his head. Surely, the West</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street girl had nothing to do with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet the expression on his face when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had looked upon the portrait had been an</seg><seg type="columnLine">avowal that he knew her, and knew her</seg><seg type="columnLine">dearly. What was she to him? What busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness was it of mine?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I brought myself up with a jerk as I real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized that I was subjecting to a jealous scru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny the probable acts of a young woman I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know'. And then, staring at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, I recommenced my mooning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hist!" came from seemingly over my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I jumped and whirled about. The room</seg><seg type="columnLine">was empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hist!" came from above my head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stared about me, bewildered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up here, McNeil, up here," came in soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">accents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My eyes searched for the voice. Over-*</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, through the room, ran an air-duct,</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the ventilating system of the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was of heavy, galvanized iron, about four-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen by eighteen inches in size, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">affixed to the ceiling with iron bracec. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, round offshoot from the parent pipe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some eight inches in diameter, afforded fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">air for the room 1 was in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was from this offshoot, as from a pho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nograph-horn, that the mysterious voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stepped close and brought my face on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">level with the ventilator opening. Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the small pipe I could dimly see the bulk of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a human body lying in the duct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello," I said. "I'm here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good sport!" was the answer. "This is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dooin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dooin!" I exclaimed. "Then, confound</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, you're not a Cockney!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Guess I kind of got your goat," came</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the pipe. "Couldn't help it--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't dare recognize you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How did you get into that pipe?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It runs past my bunk," he informed me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There is an opening there, where it joins</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pipe that runs along the other side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship. 1 crawled through and made my</seg><seg type="columnLine">way along until I saw you. I didn't dare</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to see you openly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We commenced a series of questions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">answers. I recounted all that had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to me since I had last spoken w7ilh</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, the day before. He told me of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I waited for you to come and see me</seg><seg type="columnLine">last night," he said. "After they had trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred the stores, they turned out all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights. 1 crawled out of the life-boat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hid in the shadow beneath it. I saw them</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving around the decks, but I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream of the job they were up to. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had come to the conclusion that every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was aboveboard. 1 reasoned that if</seg><seg type="columnLine">those jaspers were going to pull off any</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked stunts it would be after the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parture of the war-ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he told how he had heard Dacy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">call for help during my struggle in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ormsby's cabin, and had seen them bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">me out and shackle me to the stanchion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But in the darkness he could not distin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guish features, and since I had been unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make any noise, he had not known what</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred. The attack on the Wasp was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupendous surprise to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they had commenced to transfer</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prisoners to the Ormsby, the search-light</seg><seg type="columnLine">was switched from the II asp v after-decks</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Ormsby's fore-decks. I hat left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern portion of the destroyer in black</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow. "I took a chance," was the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dooin put it. He climbed down from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">l&gt;oat-skids, .slid down a rope to the H'a:.p's</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck and made his way below to the offi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cers' quarters. The place was deserted, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had secreted himself in the storeroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the clothes--and the accent?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got them this morning, ' he replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The steward's bunk is just off the pantry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The clothes were there; they fitted me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I put them on. I knew I would be discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered sooner or later, and I had to mask my</seg><seg type="columnLine">identity. It was easy. I've played the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cockney before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  1 told him of my conversations with Dacy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my discovery of Dacy's objective.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is the Mauresubia," I said. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold is there and they are going after it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They have their escape all planned; Dacy</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned powerful friends ashore.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's Oates, he means," commented</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dooin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I don't know how they expect to get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loot away from the MauresubiaI added.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But they can capture the liner easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. Dacy captured the British naval</seg><seg type="columnLine">code-book last night, and by means of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has been in communication with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mauresubia by wireless. She is waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to come up with her. She expects the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wasp to act as her convoy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "They are slick, all right,'' swore Dooin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When does the show come off?''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't know. Tomorrow, I think."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, I must hustle back to my bunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">before that big coon misses me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what shall we do?" 1 asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Is there a chance to reach the wireless</seg><seg type="columnLine">and send a message?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," I answered. "Wireless plant is in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chart-room and somebody is always</seg><seg type="columnLine">there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then we can do nothing for the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent," he stated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But think of what happened last night, '</seg><seg type="columnLine">I exclaimed. "My God, Dooin. there must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be women and children on board the Maurc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">subia!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It won't do them any good for us to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">our throats slit," was his rejoinder. Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing rash, McNeil. Obey their orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">until we see a chance to queer Lheir game.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holy smoke! This is the bigg&amp;fc job I ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of. There must be a weak spot some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where in their armor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what if we reach the Maxresulia</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gold at Sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">before you find the weak spot?" I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do nothing," he admonished. "Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">them go ahead and get the boodle. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't prevent them anyway. Our chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">will come to spoil this little jaunt. I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">use this pipe here to spy upon every room</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the quarters--be strange if I don't dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover something we can turn to our advan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tage. But we must pull the wool over their</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, McNeil. Whatever you do, don't give</seg><seg type="columnLine">us away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," I assented. "I'll wait for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to make the break. Say, you recall</seg><seg type="columnLine">that girl I helped on West Street? That</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackguard, Dacy, had her picture in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession. I have it here. What can that</seg><seg type="columnLine">crook have in common with Miss Morri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son? He must have stolen it somewhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why, she was the truest-looking, most-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh! No doubt, no doubt," grunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dooin. "Well, I must beat it back to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">little bed before my Ethiopian boss starts</seg><seg type="columnLine">gum-shoeing after me. Remember, Mac,</seg><seg type="columnLine">go easy. So long!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The voice ceased, and the body in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">duct slid out of sight. Straining my ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the opening of the ventilator, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear, above the ship noises, the rustle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Dooin's body as he dragged himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the pipe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good night!" I called softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned to my own bed. I was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy. A great load had been lifted from</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind. I had faith in Dooin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">XII</seg><seg type="columnLine">I WAS due on watch at two o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning, but it was nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">four o'clock before I was called.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I reached the engine-room, I discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the reason for the two hours' grace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Youi vill be on watch der whole day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe, Von Werner informed me. "I vill</seg><seg type="columnLine">be otherwise engaged."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He left me a prey to all sorts of nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">conjectures. The intermittent buzzing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wireless overhead added to my excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">thAltf°°rn as was daylight, I left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ ? a a.n instanl ^&lt;1 climbed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck. A swift search of the horizon re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warded me with a glimpse of a faint, far</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke-smudge in the northern sky. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows were pointed toward it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My moment on deck appraised me also</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a bustle of preparation throughout the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. The whole crew was astir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The "yo-heave-ho" of a crowd working</seg><seg type="columnLine">aft directed my attention toward our stern.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The hatch to the aftermost compartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">was open, and a gang, under Raider's com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand, was engaged in whipping boxes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stores and ammunition out upon the deck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I divined instantly that they were making</seg><seg type="columnLine">room for a more precious cargo. Even as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked, the gang began to jettison the pile</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Farther aft, a couple of men were over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauling the gear of the whale-boat which</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung in davits, the only small boat the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wasp possessed. The United States Navy</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserter was working upon the amidship</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, and I saw some live shells, nose up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, on the deck behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I dropped back into the engine-room just</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time to receive an order from the bridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">to increase the speed. "Open her up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive her,*' came Dacy's voice through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking-tube. I rang to the fire-rooms for</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam, and in a few moments the H as/&gt; was</seg><seg type="columnLine">racking herself with a thirty-six knot</seg><seg type="columnLine">gait.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little while later. Dooin appeared in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hatchway above. He bore my breakfast</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a tray, and nimbly negotiated the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scent of the ladder with one free hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Ere you are, sir--'kew, sir," was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He placed the food on the log-desk, as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sured himself that he could not be over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard by one of the oilers and continued in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is a big, black, four-funnel steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er a few miles ahead of us. She is stopped.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is the Mauresubiasaid I. "W aiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us to come up with her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are great doings on deck," added</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dooin. "Those sports are up to some more</seg><seg type="columnLine">slick work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What now?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are parading around dressed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Germans," he answered. "They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">all dressed in German Navy uniforms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dacy is swelled up like a Dutch admir.d."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord! They must be going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass themselves off as Germans!" I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where did they get the duds?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dooin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The memory of the two big packing-cases</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had seen transferred from the Omsby's</seg><seg type="columnLine">forecastle to the	forecastle, flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">across my inind. Dacy had mentioned uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms when they had been produced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They brought them from New York," 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Dooin. "They had them on the Orms-</seg><seg type="columnLine">by."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, they are all fixed up like Dutch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, now," he said. "1 guess those sports</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Maurcsubia will get the surprise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lives in a few moments. So long--I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to beat it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We came up with the prize rapidly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twenty minutes after Dooin had left me, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">received a sigual-bell to slow the starboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine. I knew we were turning. A second</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell directed me to slow' both engines, a third</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell to stop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I swung shut the throttles, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same instant the ship shook from stem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern from gun fire overhead--four shots, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid succession.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I leaped for the ladder at the first shot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the concussion from the last one lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cap from my head as I reached the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mauresubia lay close aboard on our</seg><seg type="columnLine">port side, not more than five hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant. She lay motionless, towering above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water like a sky-scraper above the side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk. Her decks were filled with rushing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesticulating figures. Both of her topmasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been shot awray, and the whole fabric</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her wireless was jumbled along her hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ricane-deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gang on the Wasp was cheering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each of the three guns in the port batten''</seg><seg type="columnLine">was manned, and the smoke still trailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the amidship gun, where the Navy</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserter had his eye glued to ihe sights. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked forward. Up to our signal yard ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ball of bunting. A jerk of the halyard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it broke into the German naval colors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dooin had spoken truth. Every man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight upon the Wasp's deck, with the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ception of myself, was dressed in a German</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniform. Raider dashed past me, going aft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was dressed as a German officer. An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other man, garbed as officer, appeared upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wing of our bridge with a megaphone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was Von Werner. He bellowed across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intervening strip of water to the Maure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">subia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You vas summoned to surrender to der</seg><seg type="columnLine">Imperial German Government! If you do</seg><seg type="columnLine">nod so, we vill sink you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, all right!" came the answering</seg><seg type="columnLine">hail. "For God's sake, don't lire into us</seg><seg type="columnLine">again--we have women and children on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yon Werner descended the bridge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried aft, followed by Dacy. If the uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form had metamorphosed the German, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">even more startling change had been effect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed in Dacy's appearance. He wore the uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of a commander in the German Navy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his mustaches were waxed and trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the fierce upward thrust affected by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Teutonic military'. His iron features</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his carriage were typical of the Prussian</seg><seg type="columnLine">aristocrat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Raider and a crew of men were getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whaleboat into the water. Toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them hurried Von Werner and Dacy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Wasp was drifting astern. A bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bridge called me back to the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gine-room. For several moments I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy with the engines while Henderson</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked the ship back into position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When next I poked my head through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatchway, the whaleboat was bobbing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Maurcsubia's side. Dacy and Yon Wer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner were ascending a rope-ladder to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">liner's decks. The liner's rails were black</seg><seg type="columnLine">with people watching the ascent, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic had passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, a bell from the bridge recalled me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my duties below. It was in this broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion, a moment now and then, that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">witnessed the looting of the Mauresubia.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of what happened on the Mauresubia's</seg><seg type="columnLine">decks I learned nothing until long after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, when I read the newspaper version.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This told ho^v the Mauresubia awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arrival of H. M. S.

How Captain Lorens of the Man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resubia, with the weight of three thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives upon his shoulders, and helpless before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the menace of the destroyer's guns, co''ld</seg><seg type="columnLine">do nothing but accede to the German i'tn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cer's demands. How Commander \ on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gold at Sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schlossman thereupon produced manifests</seg><seg type="columnLine">containing an accurate description of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contents of the liner's strong-room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How the German captain was recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one of the Mauresubia's passengers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptly took drastic and unheard-of meas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures as a result.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of all this I saw or knew nothing. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">duties kept me intermittently busy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engines. Only occasionally could I dash</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the ladder and snatch a quick look</seg><seg type="columnLine">around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw the Mauresubia's steam launch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of her lifeboats being lowered into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Men from the whaleboat manned</seg><seg type="columnLine">them instantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked about for Dooin, but he was no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On my next trip up the ladder, I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steam launch, with one of the lifeboats</seg><seg type="columnLine">in tow, lying by our side. The lifeboat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">laden with a cargo of small wooden boxes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound with iron straps. There were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of them, but their weight bore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifeboat almost gunwale under.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boxes were passed aboard, and Rai-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der and his gang received them with whoops</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cheers. They dispatched them through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hatch into the after compartment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they had earlier made room by jet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tisoning stores.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On board the Mauresubia they were low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering more boxes into the second lifeboat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The IKajp'i whaleboat lay on her oars a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short distance from the liner's side, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slern-sheets I noticed an alien figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped in a cloak. But I was too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited by the sight of the little wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxes to comment upon this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 hey fascinated me, those little square</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxes all the same size, all bound with</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron straps. To and fro, hour after hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the launch steamed between the liner and</seg><seg type="columnLine">our side, towing the lifeboats. Each trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought us a fortune.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I he boxes seemed innumerable. I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew their exact number, but there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of them. Raider and his men la-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bored like demons in trans-shipping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure and getting it safely stowed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">after compartment. Expeditiously, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a single hitch, the work proceeded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throughout the entire time, the gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crews remained at the Wasp's guns and kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weapons trained upon the Mauresubia's</seg><seg type="columnLine">vitals. They were a deadly threat that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maurcsubia's officers did well to heed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THE transfer of the gold took most</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the morning. Not a surprising</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">circumstance when you consider</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that more than twenty-five tons of the metal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were handled. It was after eleven o'clock</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when a final, rousing cheer appraised me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the task was completed. When next I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">peered through the hatchway, Raider's gang</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was clamping down the after hatch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Mauresubia was hoisting inboard her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">launch, and the whaleboat was returning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to our side. In the stern-sheets sat Dacy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and Von Werner, and between them was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wedged a slight, boyish figure wrapped in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cloak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I had no chance to witness their arrival,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for Henderson's imperative jangle recalled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me to my w'ork. Soon, from my station on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the floor-plates, I heard the "yo-ho-ho" of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the men hoisting the whaleboat aboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Immediately afterward I received the sig-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nal to go astern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We backed slowly, and stopped again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly the ship trembled from the shock</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and roar of one of the guns. Two--three</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shots! The horrible thought hit me, "They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are sinking her!" I left the throttles and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">leaped for the ladder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Our backing had brought us opposite the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mauresubia*s stern. Her great half-round</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hull towered opposite us; panic was again</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rife upon her decks. Her officers were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wildly hailing from her bridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Our amidship gun still W'reathed smoke,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the navy gunner had it trained upon a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spot beneath the liner's counter. I followed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the direction of the muzzle with my eyes,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and saw that the liner's rudder had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shot away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dacy was standing by the gun, a pleased</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">expression on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "She s crippled!" I heard him exclaim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"With her wireless and rudder gone she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">w'on't be able to bother us. She'll make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slow headway steering with her propellers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We may not be reported for a couple of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I ducked below* again. In a few moments</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came the order for full speed ahead, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the added urge through the speaking-tube</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to drive her. I had a full head of steam,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and I opened her up. In a few moments</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we were racing away from the crippled liner</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at a thirty-six knot clip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Three hours longer I stayed on watch ere</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">\ on VV erner came. My oilers were relieved,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the men who took their places were</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the whaleboat's crew. T was burst-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with curiosity, but I could not bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself to question them. But I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were drunken with the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what they had helped do. The thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it made my own brain reel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Twenty-five tons of gold! Twelve mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions of dollars!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dacy had achieved the impossible. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure was his. Beneath our hatches were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little square boxes with the iron straps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twelve million--a fortune for each man!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And, unbidden, the insidious thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept into my mind, "You need but to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">your mouth shut and you, too, will have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune to spend. You, too, will share in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cutting of the melon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But would I? Would I, who had kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloof from the gang, be considered in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">division of the spoils? I felt sure I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be. Dacy was a man to keep his word. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had promised me. Two hundred thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars! What could I not do with such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sum? How pleasant life would be!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And then I thought of Dooin, and of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise I had given the little man. I cursed</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself for a knave for even idly dreaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">such thoughts, and gave my full attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The nursing of the engines soon occupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">my full attention, without any effort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. The command came from the bridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">to "shake her out--drive her till the rivets</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattle!" I obeyed. I drove her until she</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook from stem to stern with the vibra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. I took an unreasonable, but to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer a natural, delight in my task and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its results. Thirty-six, thirty-six and a half,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-seven! When Von Werner appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to relieve me, I w'as getting a full knot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quarter more than the builder's best out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Wasp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Von Werner had discarded his German</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniform for his dungarees. Instead of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face being suffused with a glow of triumph,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I had expected, he wore a troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I suppose you arc- overjoyed," I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked. "You have got the gold, and are</seg><seg type="columnLine">making the escape."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "1 vas nod joyous," he said. "Der gold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ja, dot vas good. But der woman--dot vas</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What are you talking about?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Der woman--dot vas bad. Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daev bring to tlic Vasp back a woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She vas young, uud a lady. 1 like it nod."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A woman!" 1 cried. "Do you mean to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that there ii&gt; a woman on board?'1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> uJa. From der Mauresubia he bring her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She vas his sweetheart, berhaps.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">vas young und a lady, und it vas bad to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring her together with dis hell-scum."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I clid not like it either, though at first I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more curious than troubled. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a devilish thing to bring a woman amidst</seg><seg type="columnLine">these desperate men. I wonderc l what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'as like, but Yon Werner could only assert</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was young, and a lady.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time, the Mauresubia had long</seg><seg type="columnLine">since been left beneath the northern hori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zon. The 11 'asp was racing southward, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I reached the deck I found it difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">to maintain a footing, so great was the vi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bration from the speeding engines. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">decks were wet with spindrift from the tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous bone the !!'&lt;;?/&gt; carried in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth. Our wake was a lane of white water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The deck-plates actually heaved beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But these visible signs of our great speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">I merely noticed subconsciously as I made</seg><seg type="columnLine">my way to the cabin-hatch. It was an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience for me; I had seen it l ei - t-.-, many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times. I was hungry, and I bent iny steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly toward the ward-room, where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew food would be upon the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turk and Dooin were in the ward-room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the meal was awaiting me as I had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " 'Ere you are, sir," greeted Dooin in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">best Cockneyse. "Just tyke this chair, sir.</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Arve you dinner hall ready, an' piping ot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just tyke a bit o' this, sir. Gyve some to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ivdy, an it 'elperl her a lot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is that?" I said, as Turk passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of ear-shot into the pantry. "Is there</seg><seg type="columnLine">really a woman on board?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yep, and a pippin, too," he answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She's a friend of yours, maybe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But who is she--where is she? I a^ked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Search me who she is," was his easy re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponse. "She's a swell-looking dam-., all</seg><seg type="columnLine">ri&lt;;ht. She's in the Captain's room. Dacy</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned it over to her." He bustled about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">placing food upon a tray. "Say. I got some</seg><seg type="columnLine">news. I've found out something that will</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to our advantage, I think. I have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take this tray up to the bridge. Afterward</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll duck into your room and wait for you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've got something to show you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gold at Sea</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He balanced his tray on his hand and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted for the deck. I applied myself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meal, speculating upon the nature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the news Dooin had for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard a gasp, and lifted my eyes. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight I encountered brought me to my feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sharp cry of astonishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Framed in the ward-room door was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman. She was staring at me with wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">open eyes and parted lips. It was my dream</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman--it was Mar)' Morrison!</seg><seg type="columnLine">XIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">"YOU!" she gasped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You!" I echoed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We stared as if each were an ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the moment I could not think, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not wonder. I simply stared, mouth agape,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and realized the stupendous fact that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, who had so strangely filled my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the past days, was again before me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the living flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She advanced into the room, and as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">came toward me I had the crazy, fleeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">notion that she was but another fantasy ol</seg><seg type="columnLine">m&gt; mind, and that she would presently dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solve into the nothingness she came from.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She grasped the back of a chair to steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself against the uneasy motion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, and I saw the pink of her knuckles</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiten under the pressure of her grip. Still</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stared at her, incapable of connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her body trembled more than the he?.vy</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibration of the engines made necessary';</seg><seg type="columnLine">her bosom heaved unevenly. Her face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">haggard, in spite of its youthful freshness;</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her eyes were reddened circles. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">great crown of her hair was a tumbled mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">oi gold. Yet the disorder but enhanced her</seg><seg type="columnLine">loveliness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her eyes were moist--misty with tears;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in their depths I seemed to glimpse de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spair and a biting sorrow. She leaned over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back of the chair and looked at me in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You here with Roger!" she said. "Oh--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought you were different. I dreamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you oh, why are you all evil?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushed passionately.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You dreamed--you, too, have dream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. I babbled, grasping at the word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vou, too, have dreamed, and could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">help yourself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I thought that you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She paused, and I became conscious that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her face was crimsoned, and that a fright-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ened, uncertain glance w?as in her regard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then her eyes grew hard and bright, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she spoke incisively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I do not dream of rogues. I had a grate-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ful remembrance of your service to me. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thought you were a gentleman, and now' I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">find you here with this crowd. Oh, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thought-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She faltered. Two great tears rolled out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the corners of her eyes and coursed down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her cheeks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Her w'ords were a splash of cold water</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon the face of my consciousness. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shocked me to a sudden awakening to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "My God!" I cried. "Was it you they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brought from the Mauresubia?" And then,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the evidence of her person before me,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I W'as aware of the inanity of the query.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The devil!" I swore. "By heavens. I'll</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">kill the man-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Stop!" she cried. "Oh, the shame--al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ready you would fight over me like a dog</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over a bone!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No, no, you misunderstand!" I exclaim-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ed. "If that blackguard, Daev, harms</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Stop!" she cried again. "I do not know</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what position you occupy here, Mr. Mc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Neil, but I presume that'you are subordi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nate to the man you are vilifying. It is a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mean thing to malign a man behind his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I stared at her astounded. The transfor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mation was instantaneous and complete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She stood with head thrown back, and her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">figure quivering with resentment. Her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">words were hot with anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But but," I blundered on, "the vile</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cur-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "How dare you!" she blazed. "Oh_</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I 11 not listen to such a cowardly attack</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon the character of a better man than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yourself. Y'ou would not dare to face him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with such words!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She hurled the words at me vehemently,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and with a wealth of contempt in her voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I hen she turned and rushed from the room</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into the passage, and I heard the door of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Uacy s room close behind her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For many minutes I stood, staring blank-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jy at the door through which she passed,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my brain numbed and stupid with the shock</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of her appearance and tempestuous depar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ture. Finally I recovered control over my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs, if not of my wits, and made my way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my own room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">DOOIN was seated upon the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my bunk, awaiting my appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance with visible impatience.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thought you would never come,'' he</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted. "Been waiting fifteen minutes."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Dooin, I have just seen the girl," I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed. "Good heavens! Do you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">who she is? She is the West Street girl--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl I told you about!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes," he returned, unmoved. "Did-</seg><seg type="columnLine">n't I say she was a friend of yours?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the girl--that girl!" I raced on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They have kidnapped her! Think of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">position she is in! Good God, man, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">will-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh--don't you worry about her, Mac,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he interrupted. "Dacy will take care: of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her--she's his doll."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  1 obeyed an irresistible impulse. I reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed out and throttled the little man, shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">him like a terrier shakes a rat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey--you fool! Easy! What are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to do?" he panted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The gust of passion passed, and I relaxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">my grasp. Dooin sank into a chair, clutch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at his throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ''Gee, but you are a sudden gink," he ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served. "What is eating you, anyway?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How dare you refer to that young lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an intimate of Dacy's?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> •'Huh! Holy smoke! I didn't know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">dame had your goat.

Try</seg><seg type="columnLine">that again and I'll bust you over the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">with this bottle. It's the truth; I saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it. And he moved out and gave her his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own room."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the flame flared within me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched my fists, but with an effort kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself from seizing the little man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You lit--I say you lie!" I cried. ''She</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a prisoner!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "All right, all right, T'll take your word</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it," he answered. "I didn't know you</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew her very well. I thought you just</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw her the one time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That makes no difference," I retorted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I tell you 1 know--I tell you she is a lady!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Gee, I didn't know she had you going</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that," was his answer. "All right, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">is beauty in distress. But don't you worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her safety. I saw her and Dacy to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, and he is her friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I don't care what you saw. She is true</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blue, and-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Sure, and a yard wide. Bui say, don't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you go too much on first impressions. Tin y</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aren't worth a darn where women are con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cerned."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Do you mean to intimate-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Intimate nothing," said Dooin. "I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">don't know anything about her. And any-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">how, I didn't sneak in here to talk about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her. This is what brought me here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He pointed, and I noticed a cigar-box</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lying upon my bunk. Dooin picked it up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and tapped it significantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I have it here," he stated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Have what?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Mr. Podd's little peculiarities," he an-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I regarded the box with uncomprehend-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing interest, and for the moment the girl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slipped into the back of my mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What do you mean?" 1 asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dooin raised the lid. I saw that the box</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was about half filled with cigarette-papers,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">twisted into pellets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What do you think of that?" remarked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dooin, triumphantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He took one of the pellets in his hand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and untwisted the paper. Then he oiTered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the contents for my inspection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What do you call it?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I shook my head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Looks like flour--or snow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Snow--that's just what it is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I looked at him rather blankly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It is Podd's ioy-stuff," he continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"There is enough snow here to make a man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">see rosy for a month. It's dope--coke--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cocaine, you know. Friend Podd in on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">junk. He takes cocaine.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I looked at the white powder curiouslv.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">So here was the reason for Podd's moodi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ness and flights of queer fancy. But how</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">did it affect Dooin and myself?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well, what of it?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What of it?" he mimicked. "Say--did</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you ever have anything to do with a dope-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fiend?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No," I answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well, when a man is on the junk espe-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cially when he is a cocaine floater--he is a.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nut. Does that suggest anything to you?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No," I said. "I told you the other day</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that Podd was bughouse."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dooin regarded me sorrowfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"She's stolen your wit," he bemoaned. ^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What are you driving at/' I demandcu.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gold at Sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">169</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see I'll have to educate you," he com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced briskly. "I am going to impart a</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret of my profession.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When we want to get a guy, Mac, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">look for his weak spot. A criminal always</seg><seg type="columnLine">has a weak spot. Usually it is either dope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or booze, or women--sometimes all three.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When you know a man's weakness you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hold upon him. I spotted Podd for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dope-user the first time I saw him. I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could name Dacy's weakness--a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">word that begins s-h-e-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop it!" I interjected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Sure--and about nine-tenths of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang could be reached through booze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dope is the leverage we can use upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Podd. It is the best--or the worst--</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the three. A dope-fiend is a slave, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">anybody who can control liis drug supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">is his master--master of his body and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul. Podd is an old floater; all the better</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us. With his dope shut off, he will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">as crazy as a loon and as pliable as putty</seg><seg type="columnLine">in less than twenty-four hours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, but what good will that do us?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded. "We can't do anything. Podd</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no sort of an addition to our fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fight, fight--that's all you can think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of," complained Dooin. "We don't intend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight. Here is the plan: The Ormsby</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been adrift all day, hasn't she? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are near the coast, in waters that are</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded with coastwise craft. The chances</seg><seg type="columnLine">are that the Ormsby has already been sight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, and the piracy of this craft made knoWn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps the Mauresubia will meet some</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Mauresubia should be able to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coast some time tomorrow," I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She will make slow time with her rudder</seg><seg type="columnLine">disabled. She will have to steer with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">propellers. But she should be able to com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municate her news by this time tomorrow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the latest, even if she speaks no ship. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, both ships' wireless were destroyed."</seg><seg type="columnLine">'But the Il'as/A wireless is in good con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition," said Dooin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  'You mean to force Podd to send a mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage!" I exclaimed, as the drift of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">man s talk suddenly reached me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         J see a glimmer of reason is return-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mg to you." he said. "Yes, exactly. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as this affair becomes known, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be plenty of searchers after Dacy. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must get an S. O. S. out some way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "But what goodwill that do?" 1 objected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We don't know where we are going--we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no position to give. The Atlantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ocean is a pretty big place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't you make a guess?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, how can I? All I know is that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were about four hundred miles north of</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York's latitude when we held up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mauresubia. We are bound south now at</seg><seg type="columnLine">full speed. We are about three hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles off shore."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where will we be this time tomorrow?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Somewhere off the North Carolina coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Dacy keeps to his present course. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is one thing I do know--we can't keep up</seg><seg type="columnLine">our present gait for forty hours longer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This ship's steaming radius is 280c miles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that is at an economical speed. Driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boilers the way we are now, the oil will</seg><seg type="columnLine">last less than two days. But Dacy can</seg><seg type="columnLine">make some 1500 miles before then. Noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing save one of our own navy's new destroy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers could overhaul this craft."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then we must get one after us," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dooin. "Dacy is bound for some place to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get rid of the gold. We must find out where,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some way. I am going to use that ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tilator - pipe again -- maybe 1 11 overhear</seg><seg type="columnLine">something. We have twenty-four hours to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait before Podd will be in a condition for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to approach him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are sure we can force him to do our</seg><seg type="columnLine">will?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know it. I've handled dopes before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It all depends, though, upon whether or not</seg><seg type="columnLine">he can get any of the stuff from others. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifled the medicine-chest in the ward-room</seg><seg type="columnLine">and removed all the morphia and cocaine it</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained, but Farley, or some of the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, might have some. I don't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, though. None of them look like drug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">users."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How did you get possession of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stull?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had Podd spotted for a fiend, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for my chance," he replied. "While</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boodle was being transferred from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mauresubia, my gentle nigger boss was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proving his time by sticking close to Raider</seg><seg type="columnLine">ana gloating on the boxes being lowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the hatch. I seized the opportu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nity and frisked Podd's room. I found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">box under the mattress on his bunk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Won't Podd make a row about it? They</seg><seg type="columnLine">may suspect you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You bet your sweet life Podd will make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a row! It is like stealing his life to deprive</seg><seg type="columnLine">a snow-user of his drug. He'll raise Cain</seg><seg type="columnLine">17 o</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but I am going to hide the box in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventilator-pipe, and there isn't any danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them discovering it. And I'm pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure I can disarm any suspicion those sports</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have that I'm the guilty gink. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't regard me as a man, you know. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a Cockney flunkey. I got to beat it</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, I suppose that coon is already look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After Dooin's stealthy and safe departure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went to the ward-room and hung about</seg><seg type="columnLine">there for some time hoping for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of the girl. The room was deserted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dacy and his lieutenants spent most of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">time upon the bridge, just coming below oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casionally to wolf the food that was ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">present upon the ward-room table. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of them appeared during my wait.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nor. what was more important to me, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Morrison appear again. The door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Captain's cabin, wherein Dacy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">housed her, remained closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, I returned to my room. I sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">my bunk, and for a long time I lay there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking; not thinking of Dooin or Podd, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Dacy or gold, but thinking of the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Try as I would, and I did try, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not banish her from my thoughts. In vain</seg><seg type="columnLine">I told myself that her spirited defense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dacy proved her to be at least his friend.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But myself would not admit the truth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impeachment. I recalled Dooin's words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a hot, unreasonable resentment seethed</seg><seg type="columnLine">within me because of those words. I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself that she was a stranger, and my in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nermost self proclaimed it false and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared she was near and dear to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I contended impatiently with my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceit, but her image persisted in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind's eye; her face bearing its telling marks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of suffering, her eyes tear-misty or anger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkling. Yon Werner's words recurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, "She vas a lady, und 1 like it nod</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she vas here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor did I like it. She was a lady, yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but what was more to the point, she was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman in trouble. She was in a position</seg><seg type="columnLine">that might prove horribly dangerous. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickened me to contemplate her possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate. She would need me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My blood coursed more swiftly, and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexplicable joy thrilled me at the thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She would need my help. I registered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental vow that I would meet the need.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last my watch informed me that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">high time I was on my way below to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve the German. I arose, shifted my</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes and stepped into the passageway on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my way to the engine-room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I passed the ward-room door, Dacy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice hailed me. I stopped, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">within.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What I saw hurt. For Mary Morrison</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Dacy were seated side by side on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">divan in the farther corner of the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His arms wrere about her, and her face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried in his breast. Her shoulders were</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaving, as if she were weeping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not her weeping that hurt--it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that she was submitting willingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Dacy's embrace. Coming so close upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heels of my blissful, knight - erratic</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams, the sight struck me with the force</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a blow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come here a moment, McNeil," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I advanced toward them, Mary Mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rison raised her head and looked at me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her cheeks w'ere tear-stained, but she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">willed a cold immobility upon her features.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her stony stare chilled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "McNeil, have you seen a trinket laying</seg><seg type="columnLine">about anywhere--a miniature portrait uf</seg><seg type="columnLine">this young lady? I had it in my hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I was talking with you last evening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just at the time that little Cockney was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered in the storeroom, and I seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have mislaid or lost it. I have searched</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere without success. I value it</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silently I drew the bauble out of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket and handed it to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, where did you get it?" was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised demand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You dropped it," I said. "I picked it</seg><seg type="columnLine">up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You picked it up? Then why did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">not return it before?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It did not occur to me to do so,'' I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl seemed to be blinking back the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tears, but her lips curled scornfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So it seems you are a sneak-thief," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I flinched at the insult her words con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veyed. Dacy regarded her with a surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have met this person before, Roger,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she told him with a biting sarcasm in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. "He did me a small service--a ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vice out of keeping with his present occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pation. I dare say he is one of your very</seg><seg type="columnLine">good friends?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You did not term the service small at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Justice</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time," I felt bound to retort. "And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">may tell you that your Roger is no friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mine. I am his prisoner here--as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought at first you were. But now I see</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are not in need of my sympathy."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dacy followed our exchange with a puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zled regard that changed to a quizzical</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile. The girl received my words with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">face that slowly flushed as the purport of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my words sank in. I turned and flung out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked back as I passed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. Dan,' had his arms about her again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her face was lifted to his.</seg><seg type="columnLine">TO BE CONCLUDED.</seg><seg type="columnLine">MADAMB</seg><seg type="columnLine">JUSTICE-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nev.il GHemhaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Author of "The Black Violin," ".1 Pair of Mules," cU.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SAW her as she was driving into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little Louisiana village of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Landrv. She was a tall, rugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">old woman of the type--half</seg><seg type="columnLine">peasant, half small planter--which abounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the French parishes; and even at a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance there was that about her which made</seg><seg type="columnLine">one forget the squalidness of her battered</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumper and small, rabbit-like pony. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">she came closer and for an instant turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">her strong, resolute face toward mine, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that tliis something was the dignity of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great sorrow. I shall never forget her</seg><seg type="columnLine">look. It was like exchanging glances with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After she had passed I asked the village-</seg><seg type="columnLine">folk about her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 hat was Madame Gerac--she whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">we call Madame Justice," they replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is only on this day that you will see her</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. Tomorrow is her anniversary, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she is upon her way to the cure with money</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a mass. She is as Tegular as the calen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dar Uiat one. Rain or shine, it is always</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, and in the quaint patois of die</seg><seg type="columnLine">(-ajun, they told me this story:</seg><seg type="columnLine">EVEN in her youth Madame Gerac</seg><seg type="columnLine">was possessed of a strong sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">justice. She was a fine, handsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, and she had many chances. Vet she did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not marry^ early. Her lovers were all nice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">manly fellows, she said, and there was little</seg><seg type="columnLine">*o choose between them. In fairness she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not make such a choice, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not marry only for a home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, when Louis Gerac came along, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted him at once. She could make her</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice now, she declared, and, although it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not considered a good match, she made</seg><seg type="columnLine">it without hesitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerac owned a small farm some twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from Landry. It was in a remote,</seg><seg type="columnLine">desolate section, and the buildings were</seg><seg type="columnLine">old. The fields, bounded upon three e-id«.s</seg><seg type="columnLine">by marsh and upon the fourth by a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood, were alway's wet and boggy. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter when you plowed them, the soil</seg><seg type="columnLine">would stick to the plowshare like glue. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the kind of a place upon which one is</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunate to make both ends meet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For four years Madame Gerac worked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farm with her husband, and in that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">two children came into her home. Of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">LE</seg><seg type="columnLine">172</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">children the first was born to her. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, and it was given the father's name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louis. Gerac, like most fathers, was proud</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the child; Madame Gerac worshiped it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In affection, as in all else, she was not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do things by halves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second child came into the Gerac</seg><seg type="columnLine">family two years later. It was an orphan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the son of a sister of Gerac's, and at first its</seg><seg type="columnLine">adoption met with much opposition upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the part of iiis wife. Perhaps, realizing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfailing sense of justice, she caught some</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of what the future must hold for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Perhaps it was only the natural jeal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ousy of a mother for her only child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Gerac was firm. He could not aban-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">don his nephew to charity, he said. Also it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was good that the little Louis should have a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">playmate. Single children always became</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">either dull or spoiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the end Madame Gerac agreed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the child was adopted. Its name was Paul,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its age was the same as that of the son</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the house. Six months later, having ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed himself to the weather, Gerac took</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill and died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her husband dead, Madame Gerac fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon hard times. It was difficult enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attend to the farm alone, but in addition to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this she had the care and responsibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">two small children. Most women would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have solved at least a part of the problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">by turning the adopted child over to charity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When it is a question of mouths to feed, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference between two and three is very</seg><seg type="columnLine">great.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madame Gerac, however, kept her small</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">family intact. She would arrange, she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Having accepted the care of the child, no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">matter how unwillingly, it was only just</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that she should go on with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It was now, with the growing up of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">children, that the first great test of Madame</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gerac's justice began. On the one hand was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Louis, her beloved son, the one bit of her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">own flesh and blood upon earth. On the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other was Paul, the outsider, the unwel-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">come guest, as it were, of a lifetime. Would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not Madame Gerac discriminate between</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the two? Would it not be quite natural,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">even proper perhaps, for her to do so.' Al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ready she was spoken of as a woman of ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ceptional fairness. Had she been only fair,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she might have made such a discrimination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Madame Gerac was something more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> than fair. She was just, and she did not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  discriminate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Always, from the time of Gerac's death</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the very end, it was the same. In their</seg><seg type="columnLine">infancy the children received an equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of food, of clothing, of everything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As they grew older and took thtir places if.</seg><seg type="columnLine">the life of the farm, their work was appor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned to them with an absolute impar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiality. Did Paul plow one day, it was Louis</seg><seg type="columnLine">who plowed the next. Did the son of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house make holiday, the outsider might</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest assured of an equal amount of time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be spent in his own fashion. And Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerac ever made sure that this time was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent to the last moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No," she would say. "What is fair for</seg><seg type="columnLine">one is fair for the other. We will have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cinderella business upon this place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Thus the children grew up, unlike in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular. Louis, a slender, handsome lad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed a lightness, an instability of</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose which was totally at variance w-ith</seg><seg type="columnLine">the iron firmness of his mother. He de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested Ids work as much as he deplored its</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity. He shirked, he complained, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived only for the pleasure or amusement</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was to come. With a parent less reso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lute he would have been the most hopeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">of idlers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Paul was exactly the reverse. Strong and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ungainly, with a huge, knotted frame, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">features that were redeemed from ugliness</seg><seg type="columnLine">only by their absolute honesty, he became</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the first a model of industry and so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">briety. No task was too hard for him, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty too great to overcome. He culti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vated the farm as it had never been culti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vated before. Through his efforts the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">family approached w'hat would be for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them a species of prosperity. And in ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition to these other virtues, Paul was</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed of a sense of fairness, of justice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was scarce inferior to that of his foster</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother.	_	,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was strange that Louis, the son, should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be as wholly unlike his mother as Paul, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outsider, wras similar to her in every respect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The neighbors commented upon it. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times they even jokingly inquired of Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerac if, in their infancy, she had not con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused the children.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Are you quite sure that Paul is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louis?" they would ask. "If he is not, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Madame Gerac could never appre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciate the humor of these remarks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Paul is a good boy," she would repJv *</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but Louis is my son."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Justice</seg><seg type="columnLine">175</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such was her attitude. Unstable, worth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, selfish though he might be, Louis was</seg><seg type="columnLine">her son, the recipient of her mother-love.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What she felt for Paul none knew, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it was said that she could never for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the unwelcomeness of his arrival. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">industry might have inspired in her a feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of satisfaction. It could have been nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">more ardent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">AT THE close of the Civil War,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louis and Paul stood upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">threshold of manhood. Thus far</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had passed their days in quiet un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventfulness upon the farm. The fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been far away. Reports of it seldom</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrated to such a remote district. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">Landry itself they could scarce have told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you whether the struggle had lasted one or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the beginning of reconstruction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, the people of this peaceful country</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to know at least of the dreadful after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects of war. Heretofore their affairs had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been conducted by officials carefully chosen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from among their own land. Now these</seg><seg type="columnLine">officials were thrust from office, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">places filled by a relentless horde of carpet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was a time of disaster, of injustice and</seg><seg type="columnLine">persecution. What the carpet baggers did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not steal they destroyed. They laughed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">justice. They flouted mercy. Their cruelty</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that of the tyrant who has once been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The inhabitants were patient, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were also human. When they could stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more, they formed a Comite dcs Vigi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantes, with which to purge the offices of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their parish. In less than one week the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carpet baggers had been driven into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cypress islands of the outlying sea-marsh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Biensaid the Vigilantes, and returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their farms, but their work had only just</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun. From fugitives, the carpet baggers</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed quite frankly into outlaws. Under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leadership of a brave, resourceful man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who on account of his fierceness was called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Le Sauvage, they emerged from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cypress islands to harry the country far and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide. And as these islands, flanked by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">barren and treacherous marsh, were well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nigh impregnable, the Vigilantes found it</seg><seg type="columnLine">very hard to retaliate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now more than ever was it a time of</seg><seg type="columnLine">disaster. The inhabitants, immune from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four years' struggle, found themselves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suddenly plunged into a mimic war of their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">own. Backed by their redoubtable leader,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the outlaws fought like fiends. Each honest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man was expected to take down his gun and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">join the ranks of the Vigilantes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Madame Gerac, however, was of a differ-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ent opinion. She insisted that Louis and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Paul should stay upon the farm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No," she said, when the young men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came to her. "It is all right to be a hero,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but what about the plowing? For the pres-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ent, mes enfants, you must content your-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">selves with fighting the battle of life.""</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And despite the troubled times, Madame</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gerac's action was not criticized. She had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">struggled hard, and it seemed only fair that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her children should be left for her protection</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and support.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Justice to Madame Justice," said the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">neighbors, as they had already begun to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">call her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   As for the young men, they accepted this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">restraint according to their natures. Paul,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slow, methodical and obliging, resigned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">himself quite calmly to the wishes of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">foster mother. He would like to fight, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said, if only as a proof of his good inten-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tions. His duty, though, must come before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">liis desire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Louis showed more impatience. He was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">young, handsome and dashing. It was his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one desire in life to cut a figure. Each</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fight, each tale of personal bravery but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">served to increase his discontentment. His</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mother was mad--selfishly mad, he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She could not expect to "treat him like a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">child. Very well, he would show her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   And show her he did upon the first oppor- '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">t unity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT OCCURRED *t the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of the struggle, at a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">when, accompanied by a band of</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked horsemen, Le Sauvage was scounnng</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country as with fire. He struck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped with the swiftness of lightning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">None knew where next his hand would fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">His scouts patrolled each road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">One afternoon, as they were returning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">•rom work, Louis and Paul discovered one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of these scouts. The outlaw sat on his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">horse in the security of a small clump of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brush, and, as was the custom in those</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">days, each of the young men was armed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">At sight of the scout, Louis drew hi? foster</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother down into the cover of the tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">174</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You saw?" he whispered excitedly. "It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is what I Lave been waiting for. Now we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will show them whether we are men or not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">If we lie Hat and crawl, we can approach</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unseen within easy range."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why shoot him?" objected the less</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">excitable Paul. "We are not Vigilantes,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and he has as yet done us no harm. Trouble</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will come of it, you may be sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Louis was not to be deterred from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this opportunity of proving himself a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are afraid, Paul," he sneered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Very well, then. I will bear the responsi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bility alone." And, putting his words into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">effect, he began to crawl away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paul thought for a moment and then fol-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lowed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Bien," said he. "If you are determined,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I will go with you. It is only right that we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">should stand together in the matter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They shot the outlaw from close range,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">firing together. The man, instantly killed,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">toppled from his horse without a sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The silence, the simplicity of his death, was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in some way terrifying to the young men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Had the outlaw screamed, had he strug-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gled, it is probable that they would have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rushed forward to finish him. As it was,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they fled panic-stricken to their home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Thus they failed to notice a second out-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">law who had been stationed a little way be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yond his companion. This second outlaw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saw the two in their flight, but he did not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pursue them. Instead he galloped off to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">report to his leader. Le Sauvage had a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fondness for attending to such matters in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his own way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   That night the young men made no men-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion of their deed to Madame Gerac. Paul,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if troubled, w-as calm. Louis sought unsuc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cessfully to hide a nervous fear. After sup-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">per, making some excuse, both went out to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">confer with a distant neighbor. When they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">returned Madame Gerac noticed that their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clothes were stained with fresh earth. After-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">w'ard it was discovered that, following the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">neighbor's advice, they had put the dead</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">outlaw under ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was perhaps half an hour after the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> young men had departed for their work the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> following morning, that a body of horsemen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> rode up to the door of the farmhouse. At</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> their head was the huge, forbidding man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> whose name was a synonym for terror. ^ et,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> cruel and relentless though he was, Le</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sauvace--who had once been a gentleman--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> was justly renowned for his courtesy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'omen. Dismounting now, lie stepped up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the door, removing his hat as he knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madame Gerac opened to him at once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had seen the outlaws from a distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet she made no attempt to escape. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, if she felt any fear, it was most suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessfully hidden. The day w'as bright and</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm, and already the blinds had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn against the approaching glare. Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dame Gerac only shaded her eyes with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, as is the custom of farm women when</seg><seg type="columnLine">receiving a visitor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Le Sauvage bow-ed low'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are Madame Justice?" he inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am Madame Gerac," she returned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If they speak of me as Madame Justice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is no affair of mine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And yet," said Le Sauvage, "if I may do</seg><seg type="columnLine">so without offense, I should prefer to call</seg><seg type="columnLine">you by the latter name. It will be more ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">propriate in view of what I have to say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you please, m'sieu," agreed Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerac.* "And now for your business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To begin with, madame," said Le Sal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vage, "I have always admired the reports</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your justice. To this admiration you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may attribute the security, thus far. of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your home and family. Indeed it is prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able that, with all things equal, you might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have continued immune from my wrath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yesterday, however, your sons broke our</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacit truce. From ambush, and for no ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent reason, they killed one of my men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This man, sitting quietly upon his horse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was harming no earthly thing. Firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, your sons shot him down like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Now' this, madame, places me in an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunate position. Had your sons been</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vigilantes I might, for your sake, have</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged their deed to my general account</seg><seg type="columnLine">against that organization. As it is, I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">overlook the affair. My men must be pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected. I cannot have them tired upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfairly by even' farm lad who wishes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguish himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "So there is my case, which I contend is</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly one of deliberate and unwarranted</seg><seg type="columnLine">assassination. I now have the honor of ask-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing vou, Madame Justice, to pass upon it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A long minute passed during which Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dame Gerac stood, as though frozen, in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorwav. Not for one instant did she doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth of the outlaw's accusation. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first place, Le Sauvage did not lie. in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second, she had heard the shots the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Justice</seg><seg type="columnLine">175</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon before, she had noticed the nerv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ousness of her son.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ' Come, madame," urged Le Sauvage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I regret ray necessity, but there is little</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before she could speak Madame Gerac</seg><seg type="columnLine">was forced to moisten her lips with the tip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have tried to lie to you, m'sieu, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I find that I can not," said she steadily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Your case is indeed a strong one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Le Sauvage waited for something else</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, when it did not come, he uttered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">growl of admiration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dieu, madame!" he cried. "You more</seg><seg type="columnLine">then fulfil the reports of you. I so seldom</seg><seg type="columnLine">run across your kind that I am going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark the event by an unexpected act. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come here fully determined to kill both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your sons and destroy your home. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">falsehood from you, one plea for two guilty</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, and I would have done so. But you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have kept faith with your reputation, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I, who also am accounted just, will keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">faith with mine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have ridden through the night, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">our horses are tired. Below' us there is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood. We will rest in that w'ood for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour. From your two sons you will choose</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to stand before my rifles. I will accept</seg><seg type="columnLine">a life for a life, an execution for an assassina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Surely that is fair enough?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madame Gerac could not reply. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only bow her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again Le Sauvage bowed low.</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ ''Adieu then, Madame Justice," said he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">''Remember, we will wait but the hour.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And let me warn you against any tricks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our horses, though weary, are swift, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">V	igilantes are twenty miles away. Should</seg><seg type="columnLine">I be forccd to return, it will be to carry out</seg><seg type="columnLine">my original intention."</seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a little while after the outlaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone, Madame Gerac continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stand in her doorway. Strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, her first feeling was not so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of grief as of disappointment. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared out at the dilapidated buildings, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, unprofitable fields, the fewr poor head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stock. Howshe had worked, and planned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and contrived, to keep it all together! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was what she had hoped to leave her son.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had toiled with this one end in view.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And now, perhaps-- With the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">temptation came knocking at her motlur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Her children knew nothing of the visit of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Le Sauvage. She had but to call them in,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to dispatch Paul upon some pretended</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">errand to the wood, and the matter would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be ended. Or, again, she might even con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clude the affair without deceit. She could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">call Paul alone, she could tell him of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dreadful dilemma. That he would go with-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out question or complaint she knew well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He was that kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But she w'as also her kind. She was Ma-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dame Justice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly, resolute!)', Madame Gerac re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the threshold of her home. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">her a short passage led back to the kitchen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Half way down this passage she Had put</seg><seg type="columnLine">temptation behind her. She arrived at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her decision with her hand upon the kitchen</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once inside the kitchen, Madame Gerac</seg><seg type="columnLine">acted quickly. Going straight to the shelf</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the open fire, she took from it a pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cards. It w^as an old pack, soiled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumbed from the handling of many games.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Placing the pack upon the kitchen table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she took from its nail the battered tin horn</seg><seg type="columnLine">with wiiich she was wont to call in her chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren. She was forced to blow' thrice before</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could produce a sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the young men arrived, Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerac wasted little time. She called to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them when they were still some distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the kitchen doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick, you two!" she began. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed an outlaw from ambush yesterday</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Louis stopped instantly. His face grew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deathly white, and his knees began to bend</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">under him. Paul plodded doggedlv forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His eyes were troubled, but when he spoke</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his voice was steady enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, mother," he replied, as he had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">taught to call her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You shot together--at the same time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, mother."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The man was not harming vou--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no threatening movement?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No, mother."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madame Gerac frowned. Evidentlv</seg><seg type="columnLine">something was puzzling her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why?" she continued. "I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand such a thing from Louis. He,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, wished to prove himself a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">But you, Paul--you are not accustomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">play the fool. Come, wThy did you do it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Paul s mouth closed detcrminedlv. Louis</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crept forward, his eyes appealing. Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">m</seg><seg type="columnLine">176</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerac, however, knew her children only too</seg><seg type="columnLine">well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," said she. "Louis insisted, und</seg><seg type="columnLine">you thought it your duty to stand with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the matter. Nevertheless you were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool, Paul. Le Sauvage has been here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also he has been just. Only one of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have to pay. He has promised to wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour in the wood for the one to come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. After that it will be both. Also the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. He has told me to choose between</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, but I can not. You will have to deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine the choice yourselves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paul nodded quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "jBien/' said he. "Then I shall go,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother. It will be better for you that way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It will-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madame Gerac did not falter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will do nothing of the sort, Paul,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she interrupted firmly. "The guilt is equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">between you. The punishment must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">left to chance. Inside I have placed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards in readiness upon the table. You will</seg><seg type="columnLine">each cut, and the one who shows the lowest</seg><seg type="columnLine">card will go. Come, there is no time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned and re-entered the kitchen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Paul following close behind her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Louis followed more slowly. Dazed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupefied by fear, he had thus far been un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to utter the excuses, the entreaties,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rose to his lips. Had it not been for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this stupefaction, it is probable that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would then have tried to make his escape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As it was, his paralyzed limbs seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry him unwillingly forward. Slowly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with wide, staring eyes, like one in a dream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he made his way into the kitchen and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">his place at the table beside Paul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madame Gerac did not look at her son at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this moment. There were some things that</seg><seg type="columnLine">even she could not stand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will cut first, Louis, since it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">you who suggested the deed," said she.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Afterward you will wait for Paul. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">will then turn up your cards together."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dazedly, mechanically, Louis reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and removed a part of the pack. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had done so his hand fell heavily to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, the fingers fumbling nervously at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards. Paul cut quickly but carefully, stay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his hand a little way above the pack. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">if warned by some hidden sense, Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerac faced about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paul, without a tremor, turned up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut disclosing a ten of clubs. Louis, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking hand, displayed a king of hearts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Gerac expelled her breath in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long sigh, half of horror, half of relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As was his custom Paul had, upon coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside, removed his hat. Now, replacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">liis cards, he reached out for it. With his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand upon the brim he paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is the use?" he asked himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a moment later he picked up the hat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the triumph of habit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madame Gerac had never been a demon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strative woman. When Paul came over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, she only kissed him upon the forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Farewell, Paul," said she. "You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a good son to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Farewell, mother," replied Paul, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to his foster brother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Louis stood motionless, although he also</seg><seg type="columnLine">had replaced his cards. Paul hefd out hi</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. There seemed nothing that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">say. As the two clasped silently. Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerac again turned away her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Madame Gerac looked around a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment later, Paul was gone. Louis still</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in his same position, although no</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his body bent, he was reaching down</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the floor. At his mother's glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">he straightened up quickly, furtively. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden rush of color surged into his face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his eyes exchanged their terror for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">look of sullen shame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no deceiving Madame Gerac</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the matter of her children. She knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">their every mood. Not for one moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">had she sought to blind herself to the evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent cowardice of her son. Now that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe, however, it was hardly natural that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should have the appearance of a whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly, mercilessly, Madame Gerac raked</seg><seg type="columnLine">her son with her gaze, noting the flushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks, the furtive eyes, the sullen mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, as she looked below the level of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist, her lips suddenly tightened. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">right leg, why was it held so rigidly.'' That</seg><seg type="columnLine">right foot, why was it planted with so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmness? And whence came that dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">glint of white beneath the tight-pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">heel?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With one, swift movement Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerac was at her son's side. With another</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had thrust him away. Then, stooping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she picked up the card. It was a deuce of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spades, grimy and tom. and marked now</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the crescent-like impression of a heel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dieut" gasped Madame Gerac, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">groped blindly for a chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After she had sunk into it she regained</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Justice</seg><seg type="columnLine">177</seg><seg type="columnLine">control of herself. Her eyes flashed as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">held up the card.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Explain!" she cried in a dreadful voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louis knew that tone. It was one that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be denied. Trembling, sobbing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fell upon his knees at his mother's side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">burying his face in her lap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Forgive me, mother, forgive me," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleaded. "I could not go. I wanted so to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live. With Paul it was different. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered himself at the first. He knew-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Explain!" cried Madame Gerac. "Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain before it is too late."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was after I had cut," sobbed Louis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I was holding the cards at my side. I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pack well, I had noticed that the deuce</seg><seg type="columnLine">was torn. When I felt the tear I dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deuce to the floor, and set my heel upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. I had no idea of what the next card</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be. I swear to you that I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know it was a king. It was only a small ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage, and I took it, well knowing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paul was willing to go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For just one moment Madame Gerac</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted her hand to rest upon the bowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of her son.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My poor Louis," she murmured, half in</seg><seg type="columnLine">pity, half in contempt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then she rose quickly to her feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come!" said she. "You may yet be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Louis shrank back. The color drained</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his face, leaving it white again. Small</seg><seg type="columnLine">dots of perspiration appeared upon his brow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mother! Mother!" he gasped. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can not mean it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come!" repeated Madame Gerac. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it was a command.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Louis crouched behind the table. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a rat in a trap. His lips curled threaten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly, and an ugly light came into his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will not go, I tell you," he snarled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My life is my own. You had best take</seg><seg type="columnLine">care, even though you are my mother.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Gerac gave him not so much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glance. Instead she sprang to the comer</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, upon coming inside, the young men</seg><seg type="columnLine">had leaned their weapons. An instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">later she had whirled about, gun in hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick, Louis!" she demanded. "Shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">it be here or there? You have lost, have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you not? Then you will pay me, or you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will pay Le Sauvage, or, if you are too late,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will pay Paul."</seg><seg type="columnLine">12</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She advanced upon him suddenly, forcing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him toward the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "DieuI" she burst out as she drove him</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it. "It is bad enough for you to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a coward, although I can stand that. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be dishonest--no."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And she added as she hurried him for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do not try what is in your mind. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall not allow you to escape. If you take</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your heels, you will not get a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards."</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 IT WAS a strange pair that went</seg><seg type="columnLine">9 down toward the wood--the son</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbling along before, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild, his lips babbling forth an unheeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream of supplication, the mother stalking</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly behind, her gun thrust forward as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">goad, her face a mask of silent agony. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance she gave along the path that sepa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rated the farm from the wood, only to lind</seg><seg type="columnLine">it empty. Although but little time had</seg><seg type="columnLine">elapsed since the cutting of the cards. Paul</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already disappeared beyond the line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Faster!" ordered Madame Gerac, quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening her pace. Louis, looking back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the muzzle of the gun, broke into a long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuffling stride.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they were some fifty yards from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their goal, a brisk sound of riile fire rattled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from among the trees. Madame Gerac</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused as abruptly as if it were she who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been shot. Lowering her gun she</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the sign of the cross.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Louis paused also, but only for an instant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the first crash of the volley he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made" up his mind. Before him lay certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. Behind, it might not be so sure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After all, she was his mother. Perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time, she might not live up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Louis, bending low, ran for his life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Gerac raised her gun. She was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">most excellent shot. She did not hesitate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">AND so, gaunt, silent, and tragic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Gerac comes each year to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Landry\ Always it is upon the da\r</seg><seg type="columnLine">before her anniversary, and always she</seg><seg type="columnLine">brings money for a mass.

Neither--</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing "Baldy" Brown--was it</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sickening triumph of a bully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was just a natural reaction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the inevitable boiling-over of that spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was once so typical but which is now</seg><seg type="columnLine">ebbing so rapidly from Michigan lumber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">camps: the popping of a safety-valve, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">resulted in bruised faces and battered bod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies. minor results compared to what might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have happened had there been no outlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the emotion gained that strength at</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it would burst all bonds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went from one end of the bunk-house</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the other, roaring as a storm, flinging his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick arms with the vigor of drive-rods, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">molishing with a final swing the crude chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had put three of them flat; kicking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutching, striking, swearing. And they</seg><seg type="columnLine">scurried from him, those Slavs. Not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them wanted to stand, so those who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bruised and beaten were only the ones who</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarried too long in his path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such men could give no battle to Baldy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown, with his six foot three and his two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred ten--all lithe, pliable muscle on</seg><seg type="columnLine">sturdy bone--and his woods training. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow, sometimes two, at the most three,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficed; they were whipped in a breath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he roared his way onward, daring them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So. I repeat, it was no fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were foreigners, and the first of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind with whom Baldy Brown had ever been</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to work. Up there on the south</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore European labor was making its initial</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance in lumber-camps, marking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">final passing of that swashbuckling clan</seg><seg type="columnLine">which lent romance to the devastation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">forests. And Baldy, one of the last of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind, could not bear it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had stood much in his time; stood the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming of a milder breed of bosses, the go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on of scores of companions, the arrival</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a less stanch army of native stock. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they put him to bunk and eat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">work with foreigners who would not do a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's work and who could not make a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight--well, something had to break! For</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the woods a man's capacity for manual</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplishment and blow-for-blow con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flict is the measure of his value to the race;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wo to him who shirks!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These men shirked and on them Baldy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown, accepted over a hundred-mile radi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">us as a true woodsman, had breathed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">damning judgment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Th' furriners!" he'd mutter under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. "Th' low-down furriners!" Fail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in his classification to remember that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had toiled and brawled side by side with</seg><seg type="columnLine">French and Scotch in his hey-days. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't a man among 'em! Furriners!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the limit; and unprovoked by word</seg><seg type="columnLine">or look he bellowed his warning and charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">through them, vision red, finding relief in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way he knew. From the tortured soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one man conies a great symphony; from</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, a master poem or picture; when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baldy Brown's innermost being writhed</seg><seg type="columnLine">there could be no relief other then his knot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted fists meeting flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Knowing him, then, the affair could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be characterized by the spirit of the bully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">178</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Furriners''</seg><seg type="columnLine">179</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And when he had gone from the farthest</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow clear down to the door at the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the building, Brown turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked back. From their bunks the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen other old-timers laughed indulgently</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the astounded men of another race-strain</seg><seg type="columnLine">who cowered from the storm turned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Furriners!" yelled Baldy Brown in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice choked with honest rage. "Furrin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers! Ain't they a man among yez? Won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">one o' yez please stand up an' hit me, so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can kill him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took a half-dozen steps toward them</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and those nearest him stirred, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if to retreat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah!" he scoffed, and stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Furriners!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he wheeled, opened the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slammed it behind him, going into the night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS a haggard, bruised Baldy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown who three weeks later awoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">sober in Cheboygan. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">warped memories of a dozen fights in as</seg><seg type="columnLine">many towns; of nights passed in different</seg><seg type="columnLine">camps where the presence of alien labor al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways drove him on to another trip by rail</seg><seg type="columnLine">or rutted road until he came to himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke, shaken, in the lower peninsula, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winter at its worst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Winter at its worst really meant at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">best, for logging was on and men like Baldy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown--known by the set of their jaws and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swing of their shoulders to every camp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss in the Great Lakes country--are al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways in demand. He hired out in a saloon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a drink and a ticket, and climbed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smoker of the dingy accommodation-</seg><seg type="columnLine">train which was to worn' its way westward</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the drifts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of the man who bought his services</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown asked but one question, and asked it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously, weightily, confidentially. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other, sizing the big chap up, laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said hurriedly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Furriners? Aw, th' crew's all white."</seg><seg type="columnLine">That much settled, Baldy was content to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep and wait until the conductor ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was noon and thawing a bit when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out into the snow and struck up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road to which he was directed. His heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">was light, for behind he was leaving bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories. He had little idea of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight await him in this camp on Loon Lake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lJut camps are all much alike and he rev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eled in the memory of the assurance given</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that the crew was while. Such was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient to warm his soul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here comes a jack" growled the cook</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the cookee as he saw' Brown swing into</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp just before dusk. "You can tell 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">far*s you can see," he added a bit grimly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For he was an old cook and, too, cherished</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories of the men who were worthy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grub he set out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baldy sniffed deeply the tainted air of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bunks as he shoved open the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped into the room. A bit of a senti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentalist was this big-chested son of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">timber lands, and the odors were good to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nostrils. He was glad to be back. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had his drunk; work was before him and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the facts he took the joy of the lumber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jack. Also, the crew was of white men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his breed. It was like a home-coming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the disappointment was doubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the crew came in. He heard and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected a difference in their voices before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door opened. He knew they spoke a for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eign tongue and for the instant before rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, the men felt sick at heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he held his peace and kept the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gust to himself. Something of a fatalist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, was in him. Anyhow, he held his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze to his plate at supper, went to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunk from the table and, putting his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the log wall, muttered contemptu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously as sleep came:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Furriners! They ain't--white!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     BALDY, for reasons unknown to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, tried to forget the situation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boss put him top-loading and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">labored lustily throughout the day, think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the near future when his muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be right again and he could hit the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">killing pace. It was good to be at work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">handling tackle, seeing things move, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of the fact that the old energy which</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to accomplish the big things in logging-</seg><seg type="columnLine">camps was not in evidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At night he was silent again, and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">under blankets before the whole crew had</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished eating. He was facing the inevi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, he began to understand. Foreigners</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to stay, were penetrating even,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of the woods. It made him restless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a species of homesickness, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">realization took from him for the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lust to break and maim, made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentler in a morose sort of way. Incentive</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight comes only with having men to whip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">i So</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baldy followed the bent of old cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toms, established when bosses did not drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in lumber-camps but busied themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">in search of tasks for the work-gluttons who</seg><seg type="columnLine">toiled in the crews. The same condition</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had made him revolt up there in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Superior country prevailed here. The crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagged, had to be pushed from start to quit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting time. Not a man of them took pride</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his work; not a stroke was made in heal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thy competition; their final object was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain on the pay-roll.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Brown's example went for nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A handful of younger natives saw and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted his prowess in a Listless sort of way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That hurt him, but not with the sting en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gendered by the utter indifference of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poles who made up the bulk of the crew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Worse than the failure to inspire effort in</seg><seg type="columnLine">those about him was the fact that their</seg><seg type="columnLine">slovenly progress made it impossible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big fellow to maintain his regular pace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teamsters were slow, others bungled. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could work like the furies for thirty min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes, perhaps, then wait for something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. It was exasperating, indeed!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They won't light; they won't work!</seg><seg type="columnLine">They ain't men!" he muttered over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He'd have laughed, then, had any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him that perhaps down in those men</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the spark waiting to be touched and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring out their vigor. That would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been beyond his comprehension. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see things only in his way--which is a fault</seg><seg type="columnLine">of many big men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One little Pole, a teamster, was a particu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar irritant to Baldy Brown. He was small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was quiet, he was timid and slow, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not stand the cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yez can't even raise hair on yer face!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown cried the first time his temper rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">above control, and flung a scornful gesture</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the diminutive teamster whose thin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood mustache held two tiny icicles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so malevolent was his glaring that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Slav winced as from a blow and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his shoulder with concern as he drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From then on Baldy's outbursts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequent, and with each tirade the evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of the Poles mounted. The situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">became almost like that of a wolf threaten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sheep--the way they drew together and</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened mutely while he swore and threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yez ain't men!" he would chant. " They</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't a day's work or a fight in yez! Yez</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't men!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little teamster with the puny mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tache was a particular mark for Brown s</seg><seg type="columnLine">abuse. 1 hey laced one another at table</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the big top-loader glared such hate that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other was frigthened out of eating: they</seg><seg type="columnLine">met in the bunk-house and Baldy raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">both hands slowly as if to crush the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pole with his bodily weight, but stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the movement with a taunting laugh as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little chap slunk away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, it was bullying then. Not the bully-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of one man, not the singling out of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he was small. But because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">typified, to Brown, all that was disgusting</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his kind and because the spleen which</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew in the lumber-jack there among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men from across salt water must find a vent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Furriners, yez!" he shouted from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunk one night and shut a sudden silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the room. "No grit an' no work in yez!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yez can't learn nothin'--can't learn to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work! Furriners!''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he flopped back into the shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tossed through a short night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     THEY awoke to a forty-below</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, with the buildings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees and very dry' air snapping and</seg><seg type="columnLine">booming in complaint, while the long, ripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">screeches of the frozen lake gave stronger</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect to the symphony of extreme tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. But Baldy Brown's temper was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">chilled. _ It glared at white- heat and as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung low over his plate at breakfast a ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">licious gaze roved up and down the row of</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces before him, while his fingers clenched (</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a vicious grip the handle of his knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just the sounds of feeding. Not a spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'ord, as is the rule at camp meals. So it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more than astonishing when he sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet, rested both hands on the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the table, leaned far forward and, measur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the words to let them sink in, bellowed:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yez can't work, yez can't fight, yez</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't learn! Ain't they a furriner among</seg><seg type="columnLine">yez who'll fight me--wit' five more to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">him?" He shook his fist at the little team-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster. "Ain't they twenty? I'll bust yer</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads for yez, I'll do that! An I 11 thank</seg><seg type="columnLine">yez fer tryin' to kill me!</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Naw--they ain't furriners enough in th</seg><seg type="columnLine">world to jump a white man! Yez don t</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how--an' yez can't learn--fWthin</seg><seg type="columnLine">And of course, after that outburst there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only one thing to do. With his check j</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Furriners"</seg><seg type="columnLine">181</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his pocket Baldy sat by the bunk-house</seg><seg type="columnLine">stove and waited for daylight, muttering to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself and moving his big feet restlessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's hard," he told the cook as he but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toned his mackinaw and started for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. "A man can't find a camp where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">can do a day's work. I don't want to quit</seg><seg type="columnLine">but what you goin' to do? Huh? Furrin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man can't find a camp where it's fit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live!" he flung over his shoulder as he set out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the tingling morning, off through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strip of timber to the edge of the lake where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road crossed a mile-wide arm on fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches of ice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baldy's heart was heavy as he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, swinging his arms now and then to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the blood going. He did not mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty below; that was a part of his life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But for the first time in his experience he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was knowing sorrow; not because he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of a job and headed nowhere, for that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, was part of his life, but because, for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew, there was not a camp between</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and Superior where he could find a crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">of natives. And if he could not find a</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, where was he to go? He felt evicted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sensations he experienced kept his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes on the snow before him so he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the gray team approaching across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">level lake surface when he stepped out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">timber. He was wondering what he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">do when he had covered the dozen miles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the railroad station. And after arriving</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the conclusion that he had not a plan to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his name, his gaze went up, out across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white lake canopied by the fog of frost</seg><seg type="columnLine">particles through which the sunlight strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled. He saw the grays, then; and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the driver walking beside them to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">from freezing. His step faltered and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers within the thick mitten clenched.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For it was the one gray team of the camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the teamster was the little Pole!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Th' furriner!" he said aloud and quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened his pace--just to take one good part-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing paste at the little man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was much too cold for riding, so the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pole had dropped from his load and trudged</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the sleigh. The grays strained</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the friction that frost makes when</seg><seg type="columnLine">two thousand feet of hardwood bear down</seg><seg type="columnLine">0n the runners, and their progress was slow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still, in his heavy clothing, it was an effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">lor the walker to keep up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The team gave him no concern. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would obey at a word. But after every</seg><seg type="columnLine">few steps his eyes sought a rope which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung over the top of the load and ran down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the pole. That was the trip-rope to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gooseneck. A gooseneck is a contrivance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which the eveners are attached; a jerk</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the rope will release it and set the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses free. It is an essential where heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauls are made across ice, for even the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice will fail at times, logs settle deep into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water and unless the horses are freed</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will be dragged to a drowning with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidity that is horrible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Pole had felt uncomfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">about that trip-rope ever since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grays settled to the pull across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake; perhaps it was premonition. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">even had the hemp been in his hands it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have availed no tiling, because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">load went through without so much as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crackle of warning, his footing tilted sharp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly and he was flung heavily to his side, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">doused as water sloshed over the broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice cakes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The horses grunted and scrambled for</seg><seg type="columnLine">footing, but all the power they could bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bear was as a whiff of nothing against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tug from behind and they went backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down, snorting with fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From afar Baldv Brown saw' the load</seg><seg type="columnLine">settle and knew what it meant. His ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">licious motive was forgotten with the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptness that his feet took up the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of running. For horses were through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ice and it needed a man to get them out!</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he ran he felt the hot scorn for foreigners</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'ell up. A man should be with that team!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Buf his scornful expletives ceased and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered astonishment at what he saw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could not hear the Pole's cry of fright</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the ice gave and put him off his balance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he did see the little fellow roll over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drag a leg from the grip two blocks of ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">had clamped on it, stumble to his feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitch forward again as the settling load</seg><seg type="columnLine">careened and set his footing heaving. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he went into water! Water that</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoked when the shriveling air met it!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Baldy Brown felt a shiver shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">through him as he ran, thinking not of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">teamster, but of how water would feel on</seg><seg type="columnLine">human flesh--at forty below!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Again the little Pole found footing and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing already beginning to stiffen, sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">his balance. The team was down, strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling vainly to keep noses above the broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice which floated, ready to congeal, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. To trip that gooseneck! Such was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only way out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And lo, as he poised to spring for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">submerged load and grasp the rope which</seg><seg type="columnLine">still dangled over the topmost log, he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line snatched from sight and jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the surface as a threshing horse's</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg tangled with it below. His team was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast and the trip-rope gone; his hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">already freezing in their soaked gloves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He cried out in his native tongue and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked wildly about. A man was running</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him, but the man was two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards away, in heavy clothing and making</seg><seg type="columnLine">it over snow dry as salt, where feet could</seg><seg type="columnLine">get no fair hold. The horses would perish</seg><seg type="columnLine">before that help came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man shook his numbed hands free</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the stiff gloves and tore open his jacket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, stooped over on his insecure footing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hesitated an instant before jumping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Breath whistled from liim as his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged into that water, but he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">falter. With one senseless hand stuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffly into the crevice between two logs</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thrust the other deep down and groped</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that rope; he worked his legs about in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hope they might catch a loop of the line;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he twisted and turned, fighting off the kill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing chill as the seconds sped, sobbing to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. His head went under water and ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed in his hair when it came above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. He cried aloud--and the arm that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tried to keep him safe lost its hold. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank down, close to the churning heels of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grays; then came up battling. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crook of an elbow he clutched the trip-rope!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on, yez!" he heard a man cry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a figure flounder over the ice to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">load. "Hold yer rope -- an' I'll get yez</seg><seg type="columnLine">all!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Fingers fastened in the neck of his sweat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er and his body was jerked to the submerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">logs with a vigor of lift that was almost sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erhuman. Then the exquisite torture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">frost began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Big Baldy Brown got the little chap to</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid ice somehow--he never quite remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered--and dropped him there. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">yanked lustily at the rope for which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slav had gone into that ice water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The horses renewed their threshing as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tugs went black and chunks of ice slid from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hind quarters as they came close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Choke heem, choke heem! a thin voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">begged in his ear as Baldy reached for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grays' heads from firm footing, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared back--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Choke th' off one if yez can; I'm gettin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">this one!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tore a line free, breaking the stout</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather with what seemed like a half motion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looped the strap about the animal's throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shut down on his windpipe. He held</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throttling bond there with one hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned on his side to help with the other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heedless even of the strain the frenzied horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">put against him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Pole moved stiffly, as if his</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts were of lead. He dragged himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to Baldy and reached out frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands for the head of the free horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look out, yez -- you'll fall in agin!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woodsman growled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then together, the one arm of Brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">working with the two all-but-useless ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the little Pole--they brought another</seg><seg type="columnLine">rein to bear about that other animal's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. Baldy put the power of his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the straps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They did not know the physics of tl</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation. But they knew that to cut oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breathing of the animals would set</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bodies floating high and that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be easily pulled to solid ice. Slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the animals choked down and their bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose to the surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the other team came up with horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a run and driver swearing his encourage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment from afar Baldy was speechless from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cold and the Pole lay motionless, en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cased in ice. And by the time the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse had been pulled from the hole, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped make, to lie breathing in sobs after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the choking that had saved his life, Baldy</seg><seg type="columnLine">could utter words only at the cost of an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense effort. He finally said--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get this--furriner to--camp--quick!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">They took them both on the same sleigh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ministering as they made the short trip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cook, who was wise in the ways of</seg><seg type="columnLine">frost, turned Baldy over to others hurriedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he looked'at the Pole he told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp-boss to telephone for a doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the cook was looking on late that</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon when Baldy got out of his bun !</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made his way to where the little team-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster moaned. ,. ,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"'S all ri^ht, Tack!" he heard the big j</seg><seg type="columnLine">chap say.

When it comes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to dnnkin', that gemman is sure educated!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He registered here vest'day, seh. I can git</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his name from the office."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Tenney smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "No thank you, Sam. I'm not interested."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then he attacked his breakfast as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had forgotten all about the wine-bibber</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the corner. Yet on his wav out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel he stopped at the desk and glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">carelessly at the register. Among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrivals of the previous night he saw. in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawling chirographv. the name of Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">r irkins, of Washington. Tenney pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the name.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Our champagne friend?" he asked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The latter nodded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">184</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't know how he happened to pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quiet place like this for his party, sir,''</seg><seg type="columnLine">apologized the clerk. "But he's been quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, for all his drinking and his friends.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However--if you object, sir, I II speak to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proprietor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Certainly not," said Tenney. "Judging</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his friends he'll be relieved of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">money soon, and the hotel of his company."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, brows wrinkled, Tenney left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel, for while he did not pride himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly on his memory, he nevertheless</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that when he recognized a face he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should also recognize the owner's name if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw or heard it. He was certain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew the face of the wine-bibber. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all his wide acquaintance, he had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">met a man named Peter Firkins. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange; Tenney might see a man and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know his name, yet if the name were men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned Tenney would always know where</seg><seg type="columnLine">to place it. Likewise, if a name were men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned, and a little later Tenney should see</seg><seg type="columnLine">its owner, even the lapse of many years</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not cause him hesitation in applying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name to the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I must be getting old," he told himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Failing memory is the first sign, I'm told.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He shrugged his shoulders and hailed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cab. In the presence of the important</seg><seg type="columnLine">message from Dilkes, Chief of the Secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">Service, which had come to him just before</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast, Tenney could ill afford to fret</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brain over trivialities. He had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed the petty matter from his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he entered the office of his Chief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, Chief," he said, "you sent word</seg><seg type="columnLine">that--had broken loose, so as soon as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished breakfast, I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He paused, his eyes suddenly alighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a third figure in the room, a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, whose lack of stature was emphasized</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the manner in which he huddled--that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the word--in a huge leather-cushioned arm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. The face and figure Tenney recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized at once, and he raised his eyebrows</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquiringly as he looked at Dilkes; he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came suddenly conscious that the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiated nervous strain. The man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair lifted burning eyes and looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tenney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This the man, Chief Dilkes?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This is he," replied the Chief. "Ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney, this is the Secretary of War. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to me, and I've sent for you be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Secretary interrupted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why did you not come at once, sir?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Is breakfast more important than--than</seg><seg type="columnLine">patriotism?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tenney flushed,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's rather essential, sir, that I come</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared. I'm not a health faddist. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">need breakfast before I do anything. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I rather judged from the Chiefs message</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I'd have to do some thinking."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thinking?" cried Dilkes. "Acting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tenney! Acting at once! Before the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret of the War Department is given</seg><seg type="columnLine">away; before the-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Before the United States is laid bare to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack which it can not resist," cried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Secretary.

"The seller</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows, the buyer knows, and--maybe we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">know by and by. Try and tell me ju?t</seg><seg type="columnLine">what has happened, will you. please? '</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was an easy friendliness in Ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney's manner, an absence of flunkyism in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presence of the cabinet official, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke of conscious equality with any one and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every one. It spoke of more than that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it spoke of the sane viewpoint that refuses</seg><seg type="columnLine">to recognize the supernatural in the purely</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical. It spoke of confidence unmeas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ured, which is different from conceit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dilkes used to say that Tenney hyp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">notized people. Tenney denied the charge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I make 'em come down to earth; that s</seg><seg type="columnLine">all," he used to say.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Figures Can't Lie</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in the present instance the Secretary</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down to earth. The bulk of Tenney,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the easy voice and colloquial speech were</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a cool spring in which the cabinet officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathed a burning brain. His eyes seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cool and liis upper lip ceased twitching.</seg><seg type="columnLine">y "YOU'LL excuse my losing control</seg><seg type="columnLine">of myself," he said, slightly apolo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">getic, "when I tell you what's</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened and the--the impossibility of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">happening. Last night, in the Washington</seg><seg type="columnLine">Post-office, a mail-sorter was going over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mail. In some way he tore an envelope</seg><seg type="columnLine">open. He told me that, while unusual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such accidents happen once in a while.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, the contents of the envelope fell out</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the floor. The sorter picked them up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to replace them in the envelope. But his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye happened to be struck by a typewrit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten line across the top of the first page</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the contents.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the address. He saw that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans were addressed to one Itchi Marcy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fruit merchant in this city. He won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered that a Japanese should be receiving</seg><seg type="columnLine">copies of our military plans.

Now, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the room with me at the time--my pri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vate office in the War Department--were</seg><seg type="columnLine">just two men: the First Assistant Secretary</seg><seg type="columnLine">of War, and my stenographer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From two o'clock, when we commenced</seg><seg type="columnLine">work on the plans, until six, when I locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plans in my safe and left the office, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one entered the office, no one left it; no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">even knocked upon the door.

The Secretary sighed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was midnight," he resumed, "when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mail-sorter brought me tliis envelope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My first thought was to have my stenog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapher arrested.

Ihe man clever enough to effect</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this treason was not fool enough to use a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">machine that might be traced. He had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">probably gone to any one of a hundred</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">places where he might use a machine for a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">few minutes. It would mean weeks of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">laborious search to trace the machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tenney shook his head; he wouldn't do it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Whoever the traitor was, he was nothing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">short of a genius in his cunning. Genius</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--that was it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yet genius," said Tennev to himself,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"is merely the art of taking' pains. This</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fellow took infinite pains to prove that an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">apparent impossibility had been effected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">\Y hy? So that in the event of discovery</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he would never be suspected."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He stopped short in his walk and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scratched his head. Suddenly he laushed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "If I try thinking this out," he told him-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">self, "I'll go as bug as the Secretary is get-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ting. Nix! I'll do something!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   He strode toward the post-office. Care-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lessly, he had neglected to take the name of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the mail-sorter. He would not go back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and ask the Secretary for it, for the post-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">office was close at hand; he could find the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">name there. And so he did; liis gold badge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ga\ e him access to the list of employees and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their hours of duty. It was not Tenney's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">method to ask directly for information</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when indirection accomplished the same</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing. Direction crystallized suspicion; there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was no reason why the postal people</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">should know of his wish to see the sorter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">So why let them know? Why £rive them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">opportunity to talk?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Tenney took the list and ran over it: he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">found the name of Michael Clarke, sorter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hours from 4 r. m. to midnight. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">must be the man who had notified the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Secretary of the treason. Tennev started</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to fold up the list, his eye run^iing idlv</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down the columns of names as he did so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As though printed in letters of llame. he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the name Henry Davis. The camera</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye begets the photographic brain. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the name, and the face that the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">belonged to stood before his mental eves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">et lenuey did not start, gave no sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion. He merely folded the paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">neatly and handed it to the chief clerk who</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanksr°CUred ^ f°r ^ With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">l88</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hope there's no scandal in our depart-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment," said the clerk anxiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "If there were I'd be liable to tell you,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't I?" grinned Tenney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And then he left the building, his entire</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plan of action changed. He had intended</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to visit the sorter, in order to go over care-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fully the latter's tale of the discovery. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had intended to mail the plans to Marcy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that suspicion might not be aroused. Bet-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ter to let the Japs get one more secret than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so to alarm the plotters that they might</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">further conceal their identities and methods.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But now-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a hunch," said Tenney, "it's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunch! But so's most of this game."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For Tenney was frank, even with him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. He knew that common sense, appli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation and luck were the chief elements of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the criminologist's success. The first two</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had always; the third he seized upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">whensoever he might.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THE landlady of the modest board-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing house was most loquacious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Far be it from a widow woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her living to make to gossip about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">guests, Mr. Davis," she said, "but, honest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm glad you're here. Your brother is</seg><seg type="columnLine">always reg'lar with his rent money, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Davis, and I dunno's I have any call to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything at all about him; but me taking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of interest in all my guests, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">being his own brother seems like my con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">science compels me to tell you that your</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother is carrying on awful, Mr. Davis."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boys will be boys, Mrs. Paxton," grin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ned the pseudo Davis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know that, Mr. Davis, and your</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother is a nicc-mannered boy, too. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ain't been to home at all last night. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">last week he was out three whole nights and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the week before that four times, and--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't want you should repeat all this. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">when your brother came here a year ago he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as nice a young man as I'd want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But lately--he's got in bad company,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Davis. 1 knew it; for in his room I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">found racin' papers, and pieces of cardboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I know are bettin' tickets. My poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead husband had that bad habit--playin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the races, Mr. Davis, and I know the bettin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">tickets when I see 'em. It led my husband</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drink and then--I'm a widow woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, Mr. Davis, and I feel it's my Christian</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty to tell you about your young brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">so's you can snatch him from the burnin',</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Davis. And if you're offended and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get him to move--well, I've done ray duty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Davis."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not offended," was her visitor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer. "I appreciate your kindness. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall certainly lecture my brother."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You certainly ought to, sir," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landlady. "Him bettin' two hundred at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clip--I dunno how he does it on his salary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's headed for ruin, sir, if you'll excuse a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christian woman for sayin' what it's her</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounden duty to say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you, Mrs. Paxton," was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave answer. "I'll see Henry today.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good afternoon. I'm only sorry- that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't at home. But you tell him of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">call if he comes home before I get back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Have him stay in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I will, sir," promised the landlady.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whereupon Tenney, making mental note</seg><seg type="columnLine">to send the landlady a twenty-dollar bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the information which she had given to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the alleged brother of the young mail clerk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henry Davis, departed from the house of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valuable and good-hearted Mrs. Paxton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Around the corner he found a drug store</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherein was a Washington directory. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the C's. Shortly he was in pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">session of the information that James Col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, clerk in the War Department, lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">at an address near Dupont Circle. Ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney's eyebrows were raised. He smiled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent his steps in the direction oi the sten- g-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapher's address. It was a private hotel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the best. Colwell's entire weekly</seg><seg type="columnLine">salary would hardly pay the stenographer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent, much less clothe and feed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a wonder,' said Tenney to himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that the main guys don't look after their</seg><seg type="columnLine">employees more. Trust a man with im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant, priceless secrets, and never in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigate to see what's his manner of liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grunted disgust at the fatuousness</seg><seg type="columnLine">that trusted without investigation, and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the neighborhood. Half an hour lat» r he</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the fruit store of Itchi Marcy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There happened to be no customers in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">store at the moment, and a white clerk ^as</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged in piling fruit in attractive</seg><seg type="columnLine">mids. Tenney walked past him and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed himself to a bright-eyed Japanese</seg><seg type="columnLine">who sat at a desk. From an inner pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Secret Service man pulled the bundle ot</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans, in a plain envelope. He laid them</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Marcy's desk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Figures Can't Lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">189</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose you were alarmed because</seg><seg type="columnLine">they hadn't come, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Jap looked up suspiciously; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the envelope and glanced at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why were they sent this way?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Getting a little leery of the mail," was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tenney's answer. "It looked safer this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you?" demanded Marcy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I'm just a friend," smiled Tenney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I'm getting mine, which reminds me,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he--you know who I mean--says he needs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a bunch of coin today. Anything doing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Jap looked again at the envelope's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">contents. If he had any suspicion it vanished</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at a closer examination of the papers. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unlocked his safe, placing the papers there-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in and at the same time extracting from a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drawer some bills of a denomination quite</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">large to be in the possession of a retail</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fruiterer. He handed the money to Tenney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The latter shook his head. He achieved a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sullenly sheepish look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put it in an envelope," he said, "and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seal it. He--he don't trust me a whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot,-him, and he'll swear I copped some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for myself if it ain't in an envelope."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the Jap looked curiously at Tenney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But he made no demur. He placed the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bills in an envelope, sealed it, and handed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it to Tenney. The latter shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Address it," he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Jap's eyes gleamed; his hand shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth and pulled open Tenney's coat; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">useful little gold badge with the insignia</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Secret Service was revealed. Marcy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">other hand shot to a drawer in his desk, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tenney had recovered from Ins first sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise; his fingers closed around the wrist of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marcy. There was a wrench, a straining</seg><seg type="columnLine">heave, and the Jap was hurled from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair and lay twitching upon the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before the white clerk had gathered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled wits, Tenney was at the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistling peculiarly. A blue uniform came</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the corner and its wearer saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upraised finger of Tenney and came down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street on the run. The operative</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the alarmed clerk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Nothin's goin' to happen lo you, son;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> this isn't a hold-up. Your boss is going on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a little visit with this gentleman." And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> he indicated the policeman. To the latter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> he showed his badge. "Lock that Jap up,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> he said. "Tell the Captain that no one is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to see him, not if it's the Jap Ambassador.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tell him it's the Secret Service. Got me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The policeman, dazed but understanding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded. He bent over the form of Marcy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "A little water, that's all," said Tenney.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He was going to use a gun on me, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat him at his own game; I knew a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">jiu-jitsu. Ring up the patrol, lock up this</seg><seg type="columnLine">store, and put him in a cell. I'll be around</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight to make a charge. And mind you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No lawyers--nobody--to see him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Again the officer nodded assent. Tenney</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked to the safe and calmly abstracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plans which had just been sold to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japanese. Then he left the fruit store, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile of chagrin wreathing his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I fell down there," he said ""but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't prove that I'm not right. Marcy</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too clever, but--I don't believe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other fellow is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hailed a passing taxi and directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he be driven to the Bennings race-</seg><seg type="columnLine">track. Half an hour later, in the betting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring, he found the man for whom he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking, Mr. Peter Firkins, the wine-bibber</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the morning. Firkins was under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence of liquor, but not completely so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by any manner of means. As the negro</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiter had said. Firkins must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollow; or else much practise enabled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to earn* much liquor. The man was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk enough to be ugly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He was standing before a betting-stool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">angrily tearing up tickets on the last race</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Tenney sighted him. There was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face the scowl of the bad loser. By his</seg><seg type="columnLine">side was one of the touts of the morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently pleading with Firkins to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">his judgment in the next race. But Firkins</seg><seg type="columnLine">had evdiently been losing on the first thr^e</seg><seg type="columnLine">races--it was mid-aftemoon now, and half</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day's card had been run off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For he waved the tout away from him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">refusing to be cajoled. The tout slunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulkily away and Tenney approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buyer of champagnc. He touched him on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shoulder and Firkins turned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what do you want?" he demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">angrily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The apple-cart's upset," said Tenney</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an air of caution. "I was told to tip</seg><seg type="columnLine">you off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The drunken man stared; slowly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cryptic meaning of Tenney's words pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated his intelligence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean that Marcy-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The strong fingers of Tenney gripped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's wrist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">190</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Mr. Henry Davis, otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">l'eter Firkins, I guess that's enough. Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">along with me!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">f£5Q| AT EIGHT o'clock that same</seg><seg type="columnLine">night Tenney entered the private</seg><seg type="columnLine">office of the Secretary of War.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Already in the room were the Secretary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dilkes, Stenographer Colwell, and First-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Assistant Secretary Jamieson. The eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">Secretary did not bother to make intro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ductions; he did not wait until Tenney was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly within the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you got him? Have you got</seg><seg type="columnLine">him? You 'phoned that-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know where he is," said Tenney.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But before I tell his name, before an arrest</seg><seg type="columnLine">is made, maybe you'd like to be as certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I am."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course, of course," cried the Secre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary. "Tell us--tell us how you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tenney sank into a chair. As he did so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he squirmed and reached behind him; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled forth a revolver and laid it on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Excuse me," he said, "but sitting on</seg><seg type="columnLine">knobby steel ain't pleasant." He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him at his auditors, a hard light in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never go anywhere without this little</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun," he said. "I can sure use it, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he leaned comfortably back in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, playing, with apparent idleness, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his weapon. Dilkes, unseen by the others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosened his own revolver in the patent</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster in his waistcoat. Dilkes, of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, was the only one who knew that Tenney</seg><seg type="columnLine">never played with deadly weapons. Dilkes</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to be ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This morning," said Tenney, "I saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man buying wine. Nothing strange about</seg><seg type="columnLine">that durin' the racin' season, only--I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's face and didn't know his name.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And when I saw his name on a hotel register</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name didn't fit the face. Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer about that, gentlemen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not infallible--not by a long shot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but give me face and give me name and I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember the time and place where I met</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man if it was thirty years ago. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd never met a man named Peter Firkins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which* was the name of my wine-buying</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend. Funny thing, for I knew his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">f ilCC#</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I forgot the little puzzle a while later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, for you, Mr. Secretary, gave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">something else to think about. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzle came back to me a while later, f.,r</seg><seg type="columnLine">I happened to be in the post-office and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there I saw a name that fitted the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wine party. And name and face</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought back time and event; I'd seen my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wine-buying friend two years ago, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">post-office, during an investigation. I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned liis name. then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, gentlemen, I was on another case,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the fact that a postal clerk was using</seg><seg type="columnLine">another name didn't interest me just then.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At least, it wouldn't have interested me if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it hadn't happened that this clerk's hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">were from two until ten, and if it hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">also happened that between those hours he</seg><seg type="columnLine">canceled all the mail that came from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain city district.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, gentlemen, this clerk Davis, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd seen masquerading as Firkins, took in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the letters that certain carriers brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the post-office between two and ten.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And among those certain carriers were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriers who collected mail from the War</seg><seg type="columnLine">Department or the near vicinity.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be afHictcd with dust-storms that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would follow him around by day and go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed with him at night.

Good-by. Vaya con Dios, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greasers say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Needham shook hands with him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode oil to the westward with his men. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilkes stood looking after him for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment till he faded away, swallowed up by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swirling dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's a good youngster," he said reflec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively; "a good youngster. I wish there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more like him down here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">L Ji THE line runs due east and west</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Preciosa, and they made their</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp a mile to the west, where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of the wire fence that enclosed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great two-thousand-acre pasture where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dailey and Boajs kept their stock, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">within five hundred yards of the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">national line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that point the boundary was marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a great sheet-iron monument standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a small, rocky hill. The monument</seg><seg type="columnLine">was marked upon its northern face with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms of the United States of America, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the southern face showed the eagle, stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a cactus, grasping a serpent in its talons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the symbol of Mexican supremacy since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">days when in 1325 the Acolhuaos over-ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country from the north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not an imposing camp. Five</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter tents standing in one line, spreading</seg><seg type="columnLine">their brown canvas to the sun, showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the ten men sk'pt. At one end of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">line was the improvised kitchen, made by</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply scraping a narrow trench in th«. dir*,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the length lying in the direction of the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vailing winds; at the other end of the line</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood the shelter tent where Needham slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in front of the line of tents lay the</seg><seg type="columnLine">''griund-Line," two lariats stretched between</seg><seg type="columnLine">two stunted mesquit bushes where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses and the mules were tied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The water-hole was about a hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the north. For work they could ride for</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty miles over the inhospitable brown mesa</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lay like an oven under the semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropical sun; for diversion they could watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prairie dogs that yip-yapped inces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">santlv, ducking into their holes at the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of life from the camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Four men will remain in camp all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, sergeant. We will have to have some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one here permanently to look after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock. There will be three patrols to go out</seg><seg type="columnLine">daily. One of two men will ride east for</seg><seg type="columnLine">about ten miles and one will ride west about</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten miles, returning by sundown. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other two men will watch the railroad ani</seg><seg type="columnLine">the station at Preciosa. Who s that coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">in now?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Salters</seg><seg type="columnLine">203</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's me, Dailey, Lieutenant. How are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cowpuncher rode up to the cook-fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dismounted, leaving liis rein-chains</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangling. He strode forward with out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched hand, for he knew Needham and</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked him, as did most men who came in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're the very man I wanted most to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, Dailey. John Wilkes told me that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">and. Boaz have lost some stock lately. Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">it true?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. It was about a month ago. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had driven in a lot of Hereford cattle to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatten up, an' had 'em corralled in the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">pasture 3'onder. That's what I've come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak to you about. The fence was cut by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some Mexicans and some of the stock was</seg><seg type="columnLine">run off. I think a man named Lopez was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixed up in it. He was a man we fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time ago on suspicion. There's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">question about it, Lieutenant; they do</seg><seg type="columnLine">run stock off here an' take it across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">border. They sneak over at night, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times bringin' cattle over that they swap</seg><seg type="columnLine">off here to some of the Mexican residents</seg><seg type="columnLine">for stolen ponies. Sometimes they don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble to bring no cattle along. The)' just</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally pinch the ponies, payin' fer 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the loose end of a lariat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you any idea how they do it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mostly they cut our fence an' steal</seg><seg type="columnLine">some outen our herd. You see our boun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dary fences run down like the letter V, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point right here, not more'n five hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred yards from the line. Naturally they</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut it right at the point. That's because a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse, if he's stampeded, runs straight to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear. If they cut it on the long side, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses might git scared an' scatter. If they</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut it at the point an' the horses scare,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'll just run back in the pasture. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">kin count on it that if they do come over</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' try to cut the fence they'll do it right</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. More'n that, the grass has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned off near the water-hole an' with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new grass cornin' up here all the herd'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">grazin' right down here. If you'll just</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch this fence you'll see somethin', I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll do better than that, Dailey-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see, Lieutenant, if they run any</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock off, they'll run 'em off along the low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land in the bottom." He pointed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"draw," as lowland is generally called in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Southwest, in which lay the water-hole.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They won't dare lake the cattle over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hilltops. Your men'd see 'em against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skyline. You needn't worry none. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't try it till full moon, an' that's two</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks away yit. I'll sit down awhile if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't mind. Boaz's gone up into the foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills to round up some cattle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So down he sat and talked late into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Rough as he was, he had a keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of humor and a stock of stories of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">range that, told with Rabelaisian humor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved Needham to laughter so that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuinely sorry when his guest rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll see you soon again,' Dailey said as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he swung into saddle. "Me an' Boaz'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">ove^ often. Adios</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Needham, still smiling over the last story,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat listening to the patter of his pony's feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the rocks till the last echoes died</seg><seg type="columnLine">away in the night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next day, after much thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sent a man with a pack-mule into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Preciosa on a mission that greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled that hard-riding trooper. Need-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham wanted six empty coal-oil cans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A great light dawned upon the detach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment when they were called upon to hang</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cans to the top wire of the wire fence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one empty can near each post near the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the V. In each can Needham placed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I learned it in the Moro country," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">deigned to explain. "A man always cuts a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire fence near the post. I don't know why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he does. Well, when he cuts the wire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the can'll drop an' the rock in it'll make</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough noise to wake the dead. You'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to hear it all over camp. That'll do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Day after day the patrols rode the line</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigilantly. Day after day they returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot and dusty, longing for the cool beer that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the temperance people, in that outburst of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fanatical enthusiasm that leads people to</seg><seg type="columnLine">deny to others what they themselves do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">like, had forbidden them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each day, too, brought its new baseless</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumor. Once word came that a flying ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine was about to smuggle field-guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the line to the rebels. Needham</seg><seg type="columnLine">got word of it by a personal note sent by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel Borden himself and the orderly</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly killed his horse to get the note in</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptly. Him the men jeered openly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again a report came'that bombs were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipped across the line packed in firewood</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carried on the backs of burros. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">204</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">being no firewood nearer than Fort Stevens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the report was discounted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the waxing of the moon, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he grew more cautious; but it was not until</seg><seg type="columnLine">one night about two weeks after his arrival</seg><seg type="columnLine">that anything actually happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His letter requesting his four months'</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave of absence had been returned to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing the one word, "Disapproved." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel had evidently written it himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the very period after the word ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed ire. Needham, expecting no less,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon receiving the letter, saddled his horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rode in to Preciosa to send the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter to his uncle. The message des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patched and its urgency explained, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking his horse slowly along the moonlit</seg><seg type="columnLine">road when his quick ear caught the unmis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">takable sound of iron striking against rock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He reined in his horse in the shadow of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mesquit bush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clear and distinct above him, he saw sil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">houetted against the skyline the heads of</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men, sombrero-covered, leaning toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other in talk. A moment later, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched, he saw two lean horses' heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">come into view over the hilltop above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound of the hoof-beats on the rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased. Once he heard an impatient stamp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing among the rocks and the jingle of bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rings, then a voice that said in clear, sono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rous Spanish:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alio! El hijo de la-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Needham heard no more and it was just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well that he did not hear it. He knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexican people well enough to be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fill in the hiatus, for there are no fouler-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swearing people on earth than the Spanish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking peoples. Compared with Spanish</seg><seg type="columnLine">even Arabic, which is said to be a language</seg><seg type="columnLine">specially devised for the use of the afflicted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">becomes mere childish prattle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men were on the trail between</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and his camp. If they were engaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an attempt to run off cattle or stock, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was convinced that the two men had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed so far out in order that they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">give the alarm if any one came along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail from the direction of Preciosa. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">main attempt would be made nearer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp itself, just as Dailey had prophesied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Either of two courses was open to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could gallop down the trail toward his</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, taking the chance of a shot as he rode,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or he could sneak up to the hillside above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail and work along the crest till he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed the two men, when he could regain</seg><seg type="columnLine">his camp. He chose the latter and, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounting, he led his horse straight up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hillside down which the two men had come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping off the rocks as well as he could in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up, up, up he worked as slowly and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully as a scout works in war-time when</seg><seg type="columnLine">developing a ridge that is suspected of hi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ding a foe. Once a step of his horse sent a</seg><seg type="columnLine">volley of shale rock clattering down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope, making noise enough to wake the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead. A horse whinnied in the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and only his quick grasp on the nostrils of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own steed kept him from replying. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in perfect silence for a moment, hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up one forefoot of his horse so that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should not make any noise by pawing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose shale of the hillside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A deep-toned voice down on the trail said</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Es nada. Nada pcro un conejo--It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but a rabbit--Alerla!--Be quick!''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And again he worked his way along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hillside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     HE HAD reached a point on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     hillside almost directly opposite his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     own camp and was about to swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the saddle and make a dash tor hi* own</seg><seg type="columnLine">detachment when, clear and distinct, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears caught the clang of a falling can; then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second clang echoed in the silence; then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">third! A point of flame spat out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness and a gun-shot jarred the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Halt! Who goes there?" came the quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">challenge of the sentry in the camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No time now to ponder over what lo do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pitched into his saddle and spurred into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a headlong gallop down the slope, regard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less of the prairie-dog holes that yawned for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leaping near-fore, and as his horse to-&gt;k</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slope he worked his revolver from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard curses behind him thai were</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed by a shot and his campaign hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked forward over his eyes and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly aware of a sharp pain in his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">thigh as if a red-hot iron had been passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">across it. The next moment he had swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">his horse into the trail and thundered up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the far slope into his camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men had got to their rifles and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing ready for the orders that came</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick and fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two of you take your horses--never</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind saddling and bridling them--and ride</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Salters</seg><seg type="columnLine">205</seg><seg type="columnLine">hcll-for-leather to where this draw crosses</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line.

York, you and Wentworth take</seg><seg type="columnLine">your lariats and stretch them along the gap</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fence where the wires have been cut.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You can find the gaps by looking where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cans are down. The rest of you come</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were only two men left to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and they did not follow very far, for as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as he reached the level ground in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the draw, his left leg shut up</seg><seg type="columnLine">under him and he fell prostrate, gasping:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on, men.

I'm hit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two shots from the neighborhood of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence broke the silence, followed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder of several horses in a mad stam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pede. The lone sentry in the camp fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice and then he heard the stinging crack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a rifle tired down by the line. Again he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the whirling rush of galloping horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">till the very air seemed full of it. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a long silence--he had fainted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he regained consciousness--and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not have been more than five minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">later--he heard his men calling to cach</seg><seg type="columnLine">other from hilltop to hilltop. He rolled over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and working his revolver from the holster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired straight up in the air. Presently a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man broke from the bushes and ran down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him as he lay in the low scrub. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earle, one of his own men, who almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled over him. Passing his arm about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wounded officer, he raised him bodily</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurt bad, sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know, Earle. Got a match?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hastily struck match showed a gaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">tear across the leg into which one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have laid a finger. It was bleeding freely</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the khaki breeches were blood-soaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost as far as the knee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only a flesh wound after all," grunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Needham. "I don't see why 1 keeled over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Give me your first-aid package, Earle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The trooper tore it loose from his belt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening it, tied the bandage adroitly about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wound, which was bad enough to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled much without being serious. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's aid, Needham got to his feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hobbled back to the camp, where he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men gathered by the replenished fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Anything to report, Sergeant Wilson?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, sir.

If it is a placer mine, which is a mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">in or near a water-course, where the gold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing gravel is simply washed out in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, salting consists in simply scattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">some gold-dust and then allowing the vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tim to dig it out and pan it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The method of salting a quartz mine is</seg><seg type="columnLine">diilerent, requiring at times an e.'rpert. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">salting a quartz mine, the gold must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made to adhere to the quartz in the dig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gings and in the loose rock on the core-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dump. This is done by the simple means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of loading the gold-dust into a shotgc .</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shooting it up against the rock. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be done from the right distance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in just the right quantity. Too little</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not induce one to buy; too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make the would-be purchaser suspi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious. Care must also be taken that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold is the same quality tliat comes from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that district.

It is of no conse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I see." Mr. Dailey became sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly convinced. "If we show you the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place an' you decide that it's a good thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' decide to go in fer Needham, then you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">transfer it to him if he wants it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly. That's the understanding?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It ain't hardly necessary to put that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">writing I suppose. With most people it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be, but of course no army officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">would sting another."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir?" The Colonel looked properly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, pshaw. Colonel, Dailey didn't mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothin'! Here's what we've got," broke in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boaz.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced around the room furtively a&gt;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It ain't necessary fer old John to hear u&gt;</seg><seg type="columnLine">talkin'.

About a month</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago we began to have suspicions that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't right.

Whatever he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">make, it was not a matter of doubt in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own mind that Mr. Needham would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">entitled to any of it.

No sound of any shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming to his listening ears, he became</seg><seg type="columnLine">despondent. Finally Colonel Borden, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to restrain himself longer, laid a heavy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand upon the reins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, go on, Dailey!

"There's the entry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed to a yawning, black mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gaped at them from the hillside three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet up in air.

They saw him grasp an</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhanging bush and draw himself to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lip of the bank and then pass to the ore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dump, over which he bent curiously. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">or twice they saw him take a piece of rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the pile, scrape it, weigh it in each</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, smell and taste it and finally drop it</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his coat pocket. He finished with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ore-dump and passed to the screen of torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacking which he carefully examined from</seg><seg type="columnLine">front and rear. Finally he stepped back</seg><seg type="columnLine">again to the dump, took a great piece of ore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing rock in his hand and coming back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the entrance, passed behind the screen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Land o' Goshen!" said Mr. Boaz fer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vently."

I was on a big cargo-steamcr bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Land's End to London, England. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark, foggy night, and the vessel was in the vicinity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Wolf Rock--we could hear the horn. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of first watch, midnight, and firemen were draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fires. When steam went down, engineers drew it</seg><seg type="columnLine">off from steam steering-gear. The Wolf Rock Light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house could be seen dead ahead, and when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quartermaster tried to pull the wheel to port, it re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused to budge--no steam. Mate and man strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled at the wheel, but could not move it. Steamer</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the meantime ploughing straight for the rock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When in almost hair-raising proximity, steam was</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned into the gear again, and we swung clear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Missed an iceberg once on the Banks of Newfound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land in about as narrow a shave.</seg><seg type="columnLine">T CAN think of nothing else, except the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazards one bucks against at sea, where, if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose your grip on a rope or jackstay, you go plump</seg><seg type="columnLine">into eternity. Never was a passenger on a voyage--</seg><seg type="columnLine">always worked and enjoyed it. If I sailed with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">father, I had to work harder than ever. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained in "Bluenose" and "Down-East" windjam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mers, and still retained the characteristics peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to these craft. Have taken a great delight in rough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it. Always glad to get away from boiled shirts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">collar and tie. Hate society, especially literary</seg><seg type="columnLine">''high-brows," and prefer to swap pipes and yams</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the odoriferous gloom of a foc'sle with a crowd of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sh&lt;'11-backs, and with the heave of open water undi-r</seg><seg type="columnLine">your feet. On a fishing schooner I slept in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollies for throe weeks on end and never washed or</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaved for a month--they arc the only craft I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been on where t hey do that.

Nobody ever called me "tenderfoot," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they were impressed, favorably or otherwise, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">my London breeches, they were too courteous to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show it.

He said little,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but took in everything which went on, evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">studying and contrasting our speech and our ways</seg><seg type="columnLine">with those of the men with whom he ordinarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">associated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And with all his boyish instinct for histrionics, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to be accepted on a man's basis, showing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-natured willingness to do more than his proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">share of duties around camp. The moment the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">herder had finished eating, he would hurry off on</seg><seg type="columnLine">some suddenly discovered urgent business with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheep; but Alfonso, although his billet was herder's</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistant for the drive, which freed him from the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponsibilities of camp tending, never failed lo help</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the tin dishes. And I think the way we scrub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed those tin dishes was nothing short of heresy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old herder's eyes; to him dinner was no less</seg><seg type="columnLine">palatable because of the breakfast grease on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">| KNOW of only one time that I stood actually</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  face to face with death: that was un a submarine</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Manila Bay in which I was cruising as a guest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were running awash, preparatory to submerging,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the heavy cover of the conning-towcr closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">bat not sere wed home as it must be before the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">dives.

Then, a little grim about the mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">but without comment, he continued his cruise.

Under false names I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought with Davilla against Bonilla in Honduras,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with Madero against I&gt;ia/ but this is a game</seg><seg type="columnLine">played with a different set of rules. The king of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fantry encounters i- the hand-grenade. The high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">power rirte is a joke. 1 have scm for the last ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">months continual firing from one trench to another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes at disuni es of fifty t.*.i enty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">meters. 1 have seen uncalled-for panic lake both</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, on a dark night when each trench vould be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">continual line of fire, hundreds ol men firing hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds, of cartridges each and 1 have never seen a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed by a rille-ball.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But if you want to see a shambles, visit a trench</seg><seg type="columnLine">just after a few hand-grenades have been thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it. The great sport here on both sides is hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grenading the other fellow. How playedr- Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you leave your trench on a dark night with three or</seg><seg type="columnLine">four grenades, nothing else, then you pull yourself</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the ground toward the opposite trench. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling on hands and knees goes--too dangerous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slow business. I have taken over three hours to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover a hundred yards. Arrived at the other tren.h</seg><seg type="columnLine">you keep still until you hear the relief coming, gener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally between eleven and twelve, or between one and</seg><seg type="columnLine">two. When the relief is in the trench opposite you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you jump up, throw your grenades and run ;ts if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster of Sleepy Hollow were after you. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc a good runner, the surprise has been complete,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you know the moment to drop, you should get</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of it alive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">AS I said before, if you want to see a shambles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit a trench or a communicating boyau after</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of these visits.

Also in attacking or dvfending</seg><seg type="columnLine">trenches, the grenade rules king. Nothing like it</seg><seg type="columnLine">for cleaning out a trench or for stopping a masted</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge. We all consider here that the total failure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of German attacks on this front, for the last few</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, should be attributed to our greater ability</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the use of grenades, added to our greater love (or</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold steel, for the Dutchman does not like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bayonet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">T AM sure I am boring you. my dear Mr. HofF-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, with my praise of the grenade, but you</seg><seg type="columnLine">should sec the first lines of a French force when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">start after a German trench.
