            <seg type="columnLine">of wind that pulled the waves higher.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He had made many direct crossings of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">ing and heavily laden canoes. This lake</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was new to him. It was miles across. He</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Willoughby realized now for what he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Denham feared the thing, yet he had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">upward, a smell of sea-wrack and cavern</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was stirred as by violent upheaval from</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Willoughby's heart was pounding in his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the right effect in picturing various textures.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Virgil was born in Rochester, New York,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">twenty-three years ago. His first attempt at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">drawing occurred at the tender age of three,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when the magnificently limned equine of his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">imagination was labeled "doggy" by his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mother. He attended several grammar</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">schools in and about Rochester; and his first</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">real claim to fame was established when</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">block-print caricatures of his teachers were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reproduced in the John Marshall High</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">School paper. He studied at Mechanics In-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stitute classes and the gallery in Rochester.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He has exhibited in oils, pen and ink, pencil,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and block-print, and also works in tempera,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">transparent water color, charcoal, wood-cut,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stone, chalk, and clay--preferring pen and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ink to them all. Virgil is a quiet young man,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">unmarried, with a serious face that often</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lights up with a broad smile. Athletics in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">earlier years won him a fourteen-inch bicep</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and stubby, powerful fingers. He often</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spends two or three days on a single draw-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing for Weird Tales, beginning work</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">around noon and ceasing only when dawn</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tinges the night sky. A dreamless sleep then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shuts him from the material world until noon</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">again, when he repeats the process. He has</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a keen sense of humor. And the way he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">plays practical jokes on his fellow Weird-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ists! For instance: Clifford Ball once stated</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in a letter to the Eyrie, previous to publica-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tion of his first story, that the ridiculous</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">theme of a woman's being captured and car-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ried off by a giant ape was passe. With this</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in mind, Virgil selected that particular scene</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in illustrating Ball's Thief of Fort he! . . .</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">What is perhaps his most famous drawing,</seg>
