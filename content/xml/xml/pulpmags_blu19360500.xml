            <seg type="columnLine">drawn up in the grass almost out of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">stack at the north end of the cabin. A</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pile of refuse lay near by. Joe eased the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> A kind of dread excitement foamed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the knowledge that he would soon return</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with aid. So, lie reasoned, he must go</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">ridges of muck and earth in the deep</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">swamp. Its width was perhaps a hundred</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">yards, its length a half a mile. There</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were few trees, and all of them were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">concentrated in a grove in which the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shack was snuggled. The remainder of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the hummock was completely overgrown</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">And even if they didn't, the hazards of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">doing it this way were desperate. Down-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wind, the plane would nose over much</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">more violent^. Joii's chances of coming</seg>
