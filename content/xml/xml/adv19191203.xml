It is even more important </p><p>than ability. </p><p> The secret of making people like you lies in</p><p>your ability to understand the emotional and </p><p>mental characteristics of the people you meet. </p><p> Did you know that a blond has an entirely</p><p>different temperament than a brunet?—that to </p><p>get along with a blond type you must act en- </p><p>tirely different than you would to get along </p><p>with a brunet? </p><p> When you really know the difference be-</p><p>tween blonds and brunets, the difference in </p><p>their characters, temperaments, abilities and </p><p>peculiar traits you will save yourself many a </p><p>mistake—and you will incidentally learn much </p><p>you never knew before about yourself. </p><p> * * * * »</p><p>F.UL GRAHAM was a blond, and not until he </p><p>learned that there was all the difference in the </p><p>world between the characteristics of a blond and </p><p>those of a brunet did he discover the secret of making </p><p>people like him. </p><p> Paul had been keeping books for years for a large</p><p>corporation which had branches all over the countrj </p><p>It was generally thought by his associates that he </p><p>would never rise above that job. He had a tremen- </p><p>dous ability with figures—could wind them around </p><p>his little finger—but he did not have the ability to </p><p>mix with big men; did not know how to make people </p><p>like him. </p><p> Then one day. the impossible happened. Paul</p><p>Graham became popular. </p><p> Business men of importance who had formerly</p><p>given him only a passing nod of acquaintance sud- </p><p>denly showed a desire for his friendship. People- </p><p>even strangers—actually went out of their way to do </p><p>things for him. Even he was astounded at his new </p><p>ix&gt;wer over men and women. Not only could he get </p><p>them to do what he wanted them to do. but the </p><p>actually anticipated his wishes and seemed eager to </p><p>please him. </p><p> From the day the change took place he began</p><p>to go up in business. Now he is the Head Auditor </p><p>for his corporation at an immense increase in salary </p><p>And all this came to him simply because he learned </p><p>the secret of making people like him. </p><p> You, too, can have the power of making people</p><p>like you. For by the same method used by Paul </p><p>Graham, you can, at a glance, tell the characteristic </p><p>of any man. woman or child—tell instantly the </p><p>likes and dislikes, and YOU CAN MAKE PEOPLE </p><p>LIKE YOU. Here is how it is done: </p><p>Kindly mention Adventure in writing to advertisers or visiting your dealer. </p><p>ADVENTURE </p><p>3 </p><p>Everyone you know can be placed in one of two </p><p>eneral types- blond or brunet. There is as big a </p><p>lifference between the mental and emotional charact- </p><p>eristics of a blond and those of a brunet as there is </p><p>letween night and day. You persuade a blond in </p><p>ne way—a brunet in another. Blonds enjoy one </p><p>Jiase of life—brunets another. Blonds make good </p><p>1 one kind of a job—brunets in one entirely </p><p>ifferent. </p><p>To know these differences scientifically is the first </p><p>tep in judging men and women; in getting on well </p><p>•ilh them; in mastering their minds; in making </p><p>hem like you; in winning their respect, admiration, </p><p>&gt;ve and friendship. </p><p>And when you have learned these differences— </p><p>/hen you can tell at a glance just what to do and </p><p>ay to make any man or woman like you, your </p><p>access in life is assured. </p><p> For exampla, there’s the case of a large manu-</p><p>icturing concern. Trouble sprang up at one of the </p><p>actories. The men talked strike. Things looked </p><p>gly. Harry Winslow was sent to straighten it out. </p><p>in I he eve of a general walk-out he pacified the </p><p>non and headed off the strike. And not only this, </p><p>tut ever since then, that factory has led all the others </p><p>or production. He was able to do this, because he </p><p>;new how to make these men like him and do what </p><p>le wanted them to do. </p><p> Another case, entirely different, is that of Henry</p><p>’eters. Because of his ability to make people like </p><p>lim—his faculty for “getting under the skin” and </p><p>naking people think his way, he was given the posi- </p><p>ion of Assistant to the President of a large firm. </p><p>Two other men, both well liked by their fellow em- </p><p>•loyees, had each expected to get the job. So when </p><p>he outside man, Peters, came in, he was looked upon </p><p>&gt;y everyone as an interloper and was openly disliked </p><p>&gt;y every other person in the office. </p><p> Peters was handicapped in every way. But in</p><p>ipite of that, in three weeks he had made fast friends </p><p>&gt;f everyone in the house and had even won over the </p><p>iwo men who had been most bitter against him. The </p><p>vhole secret is that he could tell in an instant how </p><p>:o appeal to any man and make himself well liked. </p><p> A certain woman who had this ability moved with</p><p>ler family to another town. As is often the case, it </p><p>s a very difficult thing for any woman to break into </p><p>-lie chill circle of society in this town, if she was not </p><p>tnown. But her ability to make people like her</p><p>toon won' for her the close friendship of many of </p><p>the “best families” in the town. Some people </p><p>bonder how she did it. It was simply the secret at </p><p>*ork—the secret of judging people’s character and </p><p>naking them like you. </p><p>***** </p><p>YOU realize, of course, that just knowing the </p><p>difference between a blond and a brunet could </p><p>lot accomplish all these wonderful things. There </p><p>ire other things to be taken into account. But here </p><p>6 the whole secret. </p><p> You know that everyone does not think alike.</p><p>iVhat one likes another dislikes. And what offends </p><p>»ne pleases another. Well, there is your cue.. You </p><p>tan make an instant “hit” with anyone, if you say </p><p>the things they want you to say, and act the way </p><p>they want you to act. Do this and they will surely </p><p>like you and believe in you and will go miles out of </p><p>their way to PLEASE YOU. </p><p> You can do this easily by knowing certain simple</p><p>signs. Tn addition to the difference in complexion, </p><p>every man, woman and child has written on them </p><p>signs as distinct as though they were in letters a foot </p><p>high, which show you from one quick glance exactly </p><p>what to say and to do to please them—to get them </p><p>to believe —to think as you think — to do exactly </p><p>what you want them to do. </p><p> In knowing these simple signs is the whole secret</p><p>of getting what you want out of life—of making </p><p>friends, of business and social advantage. Every </p><p>great leader uses this method. That is why he IS a </p><p>leader. Use it yourself and you will quickly become </p><p>a leader—nothing can stop you. </p><p> You have heard of Dr. Blackford, the Master</p><p>Character Analyst. Many concerns will not employ </p><p>a man without first getting Dr. Blackford to pass on </p><p>him. Concerns such as Westinghouse Electric and </p><p>Manufacturing Company, Baker-Vawter Company, </p><p>Scott Paper Company and many others pay Dr. </p><p>Blackford large annual fees for advice on human </p><p>nature. </p><p> So great was the demand for these services that</p><p>Dr. Blackford could not even begin to fill all the </p><p>engagements. So Dr. Blackford bm «pfcuned the </p><p>method, in a simple, seven-Tesson coursc, entitled, </p><p>“Reading Character at Sight.” Eve® a half hour’s </p><p>reading of this wonderful course wS gfve you an </p><p>insight into human nature and a power over people </p><p>which will surprise you. </p><p> Such confidence have the publishers in Dr. Black-</p><p>ford’s course, “Reading Character at Sight,” that </p><p>they will gladly send it to you on approval, all </p><p>charges prepaid.

XXm NO. 3</p><p>DECEMBER 3, 1919 </p><p>BORN TO BE HANGED, BUT </p><p> Gordon Young</p><p>Author of “Dangerous Men," “Gaboreau the Terribleetc. </p><p>I </p><p>I HAD been arrested on the eve of a </p><p>State election, revolver in hand, a </p><p>chamber empty, by the body of </p><p>1 James H. Thrope, millionaire lum- </p><p>berman and candidate for governor. </p><p>I,	Don Everhard, was tried, convicted</p><p>and sentenced to death; which, in Cali- </p><p>fornia, meant to be hanged. </p><p>From the day of my arrest until this, I </p><p>spoke no word of defense, I offered no ex- </p><p>planation and I made no statements. </p><p>The time has come when I may tell my </p><p>story. Here it is: </p><p>II </p><p>JAMES THROPE was one of the </p><p>men—and there are many of his </p><p>kind—that I instinctively hated. </p><p>And by hate I mean Hate. There are, I </p><p>believe, certain tenets in theosophy which </p><p>account for instinctive hatreds as old en- </p><p>mities carried down from a former incarna- </p><p>tion. But I know nothing of theosophy </p><p>beyond that, and I have always found, </p><p>ultimately, sufficient reasons for hating such </p><p>men without putting the responsibility on </p><p>some vague life that I may never have lived </p><p>in ages past. </p><p> Thrope was the sort of man that, had he</p><p>been a Democrat, I would at once have </p><p>declared myself a Republican. Had he </p><p>been a Republican, I would have been a </p><p>Democrat. I mention this because he </p><p>was a powerful politician and a candidate, </p><p>at the time this story ends, for governor. </p><p>He was a man of powerful body, dominant </p><p>personality, robust and more vigorous at </p><p>sixty-five than most men in the earlier </p><p>years of manhood. I believe that he was </p><p>generally considered handsome. His face </p><p>was covered with a short, neatly trimmed </p><p>black beard.</p><p> He had married rather late in years and</p><p>Copyright, WW, by The Rideway Company in the United States and Great Britain. A11 rights reserved. </p><p>* </p><p>Adventure </p><p>had continued to be a debauchee. But it </p><p>was not merely wild roisterings that black- </p><p>ened his name; he was a ruthless, un- </p><p>scrupulous, bold fellow with no regard for </p><p>laws, morals or solemn oaths. His friends </p><p>said that he never broke a promise; but his </p><p>friends, like himself, lied. </p><p> I may speak this way of the dead man,</p><p>for I am saying less than I have said with </p><p>his face turned toward me. </p><p> As a politician, I have no doubt that he</p><p>faithfully gave the promised jobs and graft </p><p>to those who served his party when it was </p><p>in office. As a big business man, I sup- </p><p>pose that he did discriminate in cheating </p><p>his associates. Beyond that he may not </p><p>be praised in my presence without evoking </p><p>a flat contradiction, and I am likely to </p><p>speak shortly and use short words when his </p><p>name is mentioned. </p><p>_ Yet he was known as a “good fellow.” </p><p>His friends were legion. He spent money </p><p>like water and he gathered it like a pirate. </p><p> I was rather young in those days. Be-</p><p>cause I had less discretion than has since </p><p>been protectively acquired out of many </p><p>troubles, I did some things that none but </p><p>a young, high-tempered fellow would do. I </p><p>was rather proud of having a reputationas“a </p><p>dangerous man”; and yet, in all seriousness, </p><p>if I now encountered such a fellow as I was </p><p>then, I would very much want to spank </p><p>him. </p><p> I admit it would be risky, for I was then</p><p>almost as good a shot as I am now; I was </p><p>then, as now, almost physiologically in- </p><p>capable of being nervous or feeling fear. </p><p> The really brave man is like Marshal</p><p>Ney, whom Napoleon called “the bravest </p><p>of the brave.” A battle was breaking, and </p><p>Ney, it is said, stood waiting the order to </p><p>charge. He happened to glance down and </p><p>saw that his knees were trembling. “Shake, </p><p>-you, shake,” he muttered, “and if you </p><p>knew where I am going to take you before </p><p>this day is over, you would shake worse than </p><p>that!”</p><p> That is courage. My knees never trem-</p><p>ble. They never did, no matter what the </p><p>circumstances. I seem to have been born </p><p>with something essentially human left out </p><p>of me_; and I mention this at some length to </p><p>explain how it happened that a very young </p><p>man, like myself at that time, had a certain </p><p>prestige among gamblers and crooks who </p><p>acknowledged no equals but men whom they </p><p>had cause to admire or to fear. </p><p> Too, I may say that I was a born gam-</p><p>bler, and what immobility my face may </p><p>have lacked I painstakingly acquired. The </p><p>inscrutable face is as essential to a suc- </p><p>cessful gambler as sensitive fingers; there </p><p>are not, and there never were, honest gam- </p><p>blers who lived by luck alone. </p><p> What the nimblest magician may do with</p><p>cards on the stage, I could do with the deck </p><p>at the poker-table—and perhaps some </p><p>other things too. That was not a natural </p><p>gift any more than the musician’s fingers </p><p>are bestowed by nature; and no pianist ran </p><p>his scales more faithfully than I practised </p><p>with cards in my room. I was, even in </p><p>my teens, determined to be as fine a gam- </p><p>bler as lived and I went at it thoroughly </p><p>under the very excellent tutorage of an old </p><p>fellow who, in his prime, had been one of </p><p>the best. </p><p> He drank. His fingers were a bit slow</p><p>one night in passing liie bottom card to a </p><p>confederate, and out of gratitude and friend- </p><p>ship I paid for the funeral and monument. </p><p>There it stands to this day, a shaft of mar- </p><p>ble among a field of solemn stones, and on it </p><p>is the sardonic inscription — </p><p>As honest a man as ever palmed a card. </p><p> But I was young in those days. My</p><p>family for some years did not speak my </p><p>name even in the house where I was born. </p><p>I was dead to all of them. It might have </p><p>been different had I not been motherless at </p><p>ten. Sisters, brothers, uncles, cousins, aunts </p><p>—ours was and is yet a large and proud </p><p>tribe—said I was born to be hanged; and </p><p>the time came when they were considerate </p><p>enough to remind me that— </p><p> “We told you so!”</p><p> A few words more to fill in some features</p><p>of my background, for though this story is </p><p>verifiable in the files of old San Francisco </p><p>papers—not so very old at that—yet I wish </p><p>to take the pains of making it credible with- </p><p>out sending skeptics to dusty volumes of </p><p>the Chronicle. </p><p> It has been my fortune, despite the at-</p><p>titude of eminently respectable relatives, </p><p>even then as now, to have and to hold the </p><p>friendship of a few fine and honest people </p><p>who had what they called “faith” in me. </p><p>This is, I suppose, largely because I never </p><p>drank; never used an oath more than three </p><p>or four times in my life; was invariably </p><p>polite—as emotionless people are usually; </p><p>Bom to be Hanged, But— </p><p>5 </p><p>never made a threat—that is a direct one; </p><p>and never made a promise that I did not </p><p>keep. </p><p> It happened that a pickpocket whom I</p><p>knew quite well—he was a miserable rascal, </p><p>reduced by hop and whisky to purse-snatch- </p><p>ing—sipped a woman’s bag in a crowd and </p><p>gloated over the contents in my presence. </p><p> A handful of bills was in it, and such other</p><p>stuff as a woman usually pokes into her </p><p>bag. But there was also a letter, and on </p><p>the envelope, of course, an address—Mrs. </p><p>Mary Curwen. The dope-fiend tried to </p><p>tell me what was in the letter. He offered </p><p>it to me to read. His words were rather </p><p>jumbled for he was half-drunk, but what </p><p>he said was somewhat borne out by the </p><p>return address on the envelope. </p><p> This miserable rat saw a chance for black-</p><p>mail and was drunk enough to suggest that </p><p>I engage with him. The envelope was from </p><p>the office of a congressman of the San </p><p>Francisco district. The pickpocket said </p><p>it was written by Congressman Bryan— </p><p>who was just making an announcement of </p><p>his willingness to run for governor—to Mrs. </p><p>Mary Curwen and that it spoke of a “dread- </p><p>ful secret.” </p><p> I did not read the letter. As nearly as I</p><p>could gather the “dreadful secret” was not </p><p>revealed,but was suggested in some way that </p><p>seemed to the pickpocket sufficient to es- </p><p>tablish a basis for “a piece o’ graft.” </p><p> What that basis was he didn’t exactly</p><p>know. He urged me to read it. He was </p><p>very drunk, and I never quarrel with a </p><p>drunken man. I took the letter and put it </p><p>aside for a day or two. I was tantalizingly </p><p>interested and tempted to read it. </p><p> There is no shame in being tempted—it is</p><p>giving way to temptation that knocks the </p><p>inner props down. I would no more have </p><p>read a letter found in a ripped envelope </p><p>than I would have read one in which I had </p><p>no personal interest and which was sealed. </p><p>Let me make myself clear on this point. </p><p> Had it served some purpose of importance</p><p>to me, I would not only have opened an-</p><p>other man’s letter, but I would have cut </p><p>into a mail bag to get at the letter. But I </p><p>have a quirk of what may possibly be called </p><p>honor which would let me as readily peep </p><p>into a woman’s bedroom as read a letter </p><p>that does not concern me. </p><p> And I was intensely interested. Con-</p><p>gressman Bryan was no political puppet. </p><p>He was a comparatively young man and a </p><p>dynamic, hard-fighting, out-spoken fellow, </p><p>brilliant and courageous; a man-who seemed </p><p>to have arisen by sheer work and brilliancy. </p><p>Naturally I admired him. For one thing, </p><p>Thrope and his party were against Bryan. </p><p>I SHALL not give any particulars of </p><p>the political fight, for those details </p><p>do not concern the story. It so </p><p>chanced that Bryan’s releection to Congress </p><p>had recently taken place, but he was willing </p><p>to resign and run for governor. The </p><p>State needed an honest governor. If </p><p>Thrope should be elected, the skull-and- </p><p>crossbones might as well have floated from </p><p>the flagpole at Sacramento. </p><p> It was to be a hard and bitter campaign.</p><p>It always was when Bryan and Thrope </p><p>fought. One of the features of the Bryan </p><p>workers’ argument had always been the </p><p>emphasis laid on the fact that he was a </p><p>San Francisco boy orphaned in babyhood, </p><p>whose whole life had been lived under the </p><p>eyes of San Franciscans who might examine </p><p>every feature of it and know that his record </p><p>was stainless. </p><p> So I told the purse-snatcher that he was</p><p>too drunk to have read straight. </p><p> I thought of returning the letter to Mrs.</p><p>Curwen by mail; but, in case the letter did </p><p>contain any matter that would trouble her </p><p>if she knew it had passed under the eyes of </p><p>strangers, she could not be reassured by </p><p>anything I might write to accompany the </p><p>letter itself. </p><p> So I returned the letter in person.</p><p> The house was a modest, solid little home;</p><p>the yard was well kept, the lawn fresh, the </p><p>shrubs trimmed, the paint new. </p><p> A young woman, neat and attractive—</p><p>that is, intelligent of face as well as pretty,</p><p>but with a wilful set to her Ups—opened the </p><p>door. She was slender and dark and, I </p><p>judged, though nothing of an expert in </p><p>matters of the kind, around twenty. </p><p> I asked for Mrs. Curwen and was shown</p><p>into a little sun-lighted room. </p><p> Mrs. Curwen came in. My impression</p><p>of strangers is always definite; I like them or </p><p>I do not. </p><p> The moment I saw her I felt as deep</p><p>sympathy for her as I ever felt for any one. </p><p>Tragedy was written on her face, and wor- </p><p>ries were in her eyes. She had suffered at </p><p>sometime or other, and deeply. Her eyes had </p><p>the steady, wide-lidded stare of people who </p><p>have been forbidden things and kept silent. </p><p>6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> She was nervous ,and troubled, and I</p><p>knew something of what the heavy lines </p><p>that fell from her nostrils to the corners of </p><p>her mouth meant. The mouth itself was </p><p>drawn tightly; the full lips Were thinned by </p><p>having been set hard. Yet hers was a </p><p>pleasant face lighted from an inner glow </p><p>of contentment. I will call it a beautiful </p><p>face. All beautiful faces have the mark of </p><p>tragedy upon them. </p><p> She was tall, well-poised and, I would</p><p>have guessed, somewhere above fifty—ob- </p><p>viously the mother of the girl who had </p><p>met me at the door. </p><p> “You wish to see me?” she asked.</p><p> I referred at once to a letter addressed to</p><p>her that had come to my attention. </p><p> There was no mistaking the importance of</p><p>that letter to her. At the first mention she </p><p>stiffened as one does to receive a blow. I </p><p>may have imagined it, but it seemed to me </p><p>that she also assumed, for a second, a grim </p><p>reconciliation to the blow that was expected. </p><p>It was as if she rather knew blow after </p><p>blow of some kind would reach her, and </p><p>she had reached the age of passive resistance. </p><p> I then told her precisely what had hap-</p><p>pened and extended the letter. </p><p> “I do not know what the letter contains.</p><p>I do not wish to know. It has been read </p><p>only by a drunken fellow who may believe </p><p>he merely dreamed what he read. And I </p><p>have brought it in person so that you may </p><p>be assured that nobody, except the fellow </p><p>mentioned, has meddled with the contents.” </p><p>She said nothing for a moment, but </p><p>reached out a hand that trembled slightly </p><p>and laid it on my arm, and the fingers </p><p>closed for an instant in a way deeply ex- </p><p>pressive of gratitude. </p><p> Mrs. Curwen looked at me with a kind</p><p>of suspended admiration in her eyes and </p><p>asked— </p><p> “What did you say your name was?”</p><p> I told her. I had’ not at that time taken</p><p>the name of Everhard. My family name is</p><p>Richmond. I told her—“Don Richmond.” </p><p>Almost incredulously she exclaimed: </p><p> “Don Richmond—you! A mere boy—</p><p>and you are the man who struck Jim </p><p>Thrope in the face? I—I—have often </p><p>wondered about you. A mere boy!” </p><p> My shoulders stiffened a little as I re-</p><p>marked that I was twenty-four, and no </p><p>doubt my maimer implied that twenty-four </p><p>was a full-grown, manly age. </p><p> “I understand,” she said quietly, almost</p><p>proudly as if in some way I was closely </p><p>related to her, “why this letter has been </p><p>returned—unread! And do you know,- I </p><p>would doubt almost any other man that </p><p>brought it!” </p><p> I looked at her in puzzlement and asked—</p><p> “Do you know me?”</p><p> “Yes—I know that you hit Jim Thrope</p><p>in a crowded dance-hall; hit him in the face </p><p>before all of his friends. Yes indeed, I </p><p>do know you!” And she impulsively caught </p><p>my hand into both of hers and pressed it. </p><p> I did not understand.</p><p> With quick, maternal-like half-phrases</p><p>she regretted that I was a gambler and </p><p>lived such a life. </p><p> “A professional gambler for six years!”</p><p>she exclaimed. “I knew you were young— </p><p>but so young!” </p><p> She said that she had heard all about the •</p><p>affair—more even than was in the papers, </p><p>some of which called me a young ruffian </p><p>who was boasting he had insulted so dis- </p><p>tinguished and honorable a citizen as James </p><p>H. Thrope. And one or two of the papers </p><p>which told something like the truth colored </p><p>it rather highly in my favor because they </p><p>happened to be politically opposed to. </p><p>Thrope. </p><p> The basic fact, which nobody knew, was</p><p>that I hated Thrope instinctively. His </p><p>eyes—it is into the eyes that one looks for </p><p>an understanding of people—were the in- </p><p>solent, lewd, vicious eyes of the bully. </p><p> I never saw him without wanting to.</p><p>strike him in the face. Something of what </p><p>that meant may be conveyed when I ex- </p><p>plain that, in all the troubles I have been </p><p>into and got out of, I have never struck a </p><p>half-dozen men with my fists. </p><p>A NIGHT came when Thrope was </p><p>on one of his periodical debauches, </p><p>and came into the Empress Dance- </p><p>hall, where I chanced to be awaiting an </p><p>appointment. He was sober enough, but </p><p>this time it would probably not have made </p><p>any difference to me if he had been drunk. </p><p>A little fool of a dance-hall girl, ambitious </p><p>to get attention from so distinguished a </p><p>rounder, clutched at his coat. </p><p> He turned, at one glance saw that she was</p><p>not pretty, then drove his fist into her face; </p><p>and many people laughed. Thrope was </p><p>always followed on such occasions by </p><p>friends of the kind—by men who would </p><p>laugh if a woman’s face ran blood. </p><p>Born to be Hanged, But— </p><p>7 </p><p> I had gone up to him. There was noth-</p><p>ing of haste or hurry in my manner. I said </p><p>distinctly that perhaps he did not know how </p><p>it felt to be struck in the face; then deliber- </p><p>ately hit him a back-handed blow squarely </p><p>across the mouth. Blood dripped from his </p><p>lips. </p><p> I said nothing more. Without turning</p><p>my face from him, I pushed a chair out from </p><p>behind me and took one backward step so </p><p>that my shoulders were against the wall. </p><p>I did not care to be shot or slugged from the </p><p>rear. </p><p> I heard my name tossed back and forth.</p><p>I was pretty well known. There was a </p><p>scrambling and stamping as some people </p><p>made for places where they thought bullets </p><p>would be least likely to hit; and others, full </p><p>of gaping curiosity, crowded close behind </p><p>Thrope’s back. </p><p> But nothing happened. I mean nothing</p><p>of importance. 1 was cursed and threat- </p><p>ened. Friends of Thrope’s, who but a </p><p>few seconds before had laughed, scowled </p><p>and cursed. Bullies usually try to save </p><p>their faces by scowls when they are not </p><p>ready to venture further. </p><p> Thrope half swung his hand toward his</p><p>hip. So far as he could see I was unarmed. </p><p>But he did not draw, or try to draw. Per- </p><p>haps he had heard—and believed—the </p><p>rumor that the reason I had never been </p><p>tried for any one of a few little gun-plays, </p><p>was because I never made a move until it </p><p>became evident that I had to shoot in self- </p><p>defense. </p><p> There was perhaps a little truth in that</p><p>report, though much exaggeration. In </p><p>those days I used a single action .44—two of </p><p>them—and I wore a double-breasted coat. </p><p>I don’t know whether automatics had been </p><p>invented or not; anyway they were not </p><p>worth considering. </p><p> The Colt is meant for quick work. They</p><p>were worn, diagonally across my stomach </p><p>and carried cocked. That helped to culti- </p><p>vate in me a slow, deliberate manner and a </p><p>certain unbending attitude—much as would</p><p>be cultivated in a man who carried dyna- </p><p>mite in his pocket. All I needed to do to </p><p>shoot quick was to thrust my hand inside </p><p>the coat on a level with the stomach— </p><p>an entirely unsuspicious movement—and, </p><p>half-turning my body to point the gun, </p><p>press the trigger. </p><p> Of course I shot through the coat. The</p><p>gun was very awkward to carry there, but </p><p>the awkwardness had compensations in </p><p>dangerous moments. Thrope probably sus- </p><p>pected that I would not be unagitated if I </p><p>did not feel secure. </p><p> It is fair, perhaps, to say that he may</p><p>have believed there were as many friends of </p><p>mine as of his in the room; that the insult </p><p>had been planned, and that he was in a trap </p><p>prepared beforehand. I offer that as an </p><p>explanation, for, though Thrope was in- </p><p>trinsically a coward, he was proud and high- </p><p>tempered, and it hardly seems likely that I </p><p>—though even then men of stronger nerves </p><p>than Iris hesitated to take up my challenge—1 </p><p>could have, by mere poise, so humiliatingly </p><p>have bluffed him. </p><p> lie cursed in the way of a man who does</p><p>not mean to fight, promised me sudden </p><p>death at some future time, intimating that </p><p>it would not be far distant, either; then </p><p>withdrew with his friends, who glowered </p><p>over their shoulders. </p><p> The incident attracted much more at-</p><p>tention than the mere facts warranted; all, </p><p>of course, because James Thrope was a </p><p>figure of importance. </p><p> So it was not surprizing that Mrs. Cur-</p><p>wen knew of it. </p><p> The surprizing thing was the interest</p><p>that this quiet and lovely woman, grayed </p><p>and wrinkled, showed in an incident of the </p><p>tenderloin. </p><p>I SUGGESTED that it was strange </p><p>she should have paid so much at- </p><p>tention to a mere affair of the un- </p><p>derworld. </p><p> “I know of Jim Thrope,” she said.</p><p> But I must pause to tell as nearly as I</p><p>can how she said it. Bitterly came the</p><p>words, “I know—” then a perceptible </p><p>pause. The “of” seemed forced into the </p><p>sentence, and “Jim Thorpe” was spoken </p><p>almost in a whisper as if, only by overcom- </p><p>ing a strong repugnance, could she speak his </p><p>name. What that manner of saying “I </p><p>know of Jim Thrope” conveyed to me is </p><p>obvious. </p><p> “I know of Jim Thrope. I have often</p><p>wondered why no man dared to treat him </p><p>as he deserves!” </p><p> I assured her that there were many who</p><p>dared; that Thrope was by no means re- </p><p>garded as the terror she seemed to think. </p><p> She seemed to doubt me.</p><p> When I started to go, her hand again</p><p>touched my arm as if to check me. </p><p>8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “You will come to see me? To dinner?</p><p>Helen and I are alone. We have few </p><p>friends.” </p><p> I suggested that she would probably have</p><p>still fewer when it became known that she </p><p>was friendly with me. </p><p> “You mean Thrope would do something?”</p><p> “I wasn’t thinking of him but of your</p><p>respectable neighbors. I am what is some- </p><p>times called a ‘habitue of the tenderloin’.” </p><p> She ignored that with a little gesture as</p><p>if she knew too much about respectable </p><p>people to care what they thought, and asked </p><p>me anxiously if Thrope had made trouble </p><p>for me since that affair. </p><p> He had not.</p><p> I did not go into details and explain to</p><p>her that it was not an easy matter for any- </p><p>body to make trouble for me unless they </p><p>came to my face. I have known men and </p><p>attended the funerals of some of them, who </p><p>scorned the cowardly precaution of watch- </p><p>ing against shots and blows from the rear. </p><p>I am not such a one. </p><p> I am very cautious. The more so be-</p><p>cause, though I always have had many </p><p>friends, I have never used any of them </p><p>as a body-guard. They have helped me </p><p>many times. I have called on them often. </p><p>What I mean is that I have always gone </p><p>through darkened streets alone, if there was </p><p>nothing but the suspicion that somebody </p><p>might be lying in wait for me. My ears are </p><p>keen, my hands are quick and I seldom miss. </p><p>And I am never off guard, never to be taken </p><p>unawares—if tense watchfulness is a pre- </p><p>ventive. </p><p> I have said that Thrope did not make</p><p>trouble for me over the episode, then six </p><p>months past; but, of course, I had no way </p><p>of knowing whether the rooming-house in </p><p>which I stayed had been fired because the </p><p>incendiary wanted to burn me sleeping, or </p><p>some one else in the house; or merely had a </p><p>grudge against the proprietor. </p><p> I sleep lightly, too lightly for my own</p><p>comfort. A creak, a voice at a distance, a </p><p>draft puffing from an opened window, </p><p>almost any sort of a noise, makes me at </p><p>once alert. I had no way of knowing </p><p>whether it was some one who had taken </p><p>Thrope’s money or who had mistaken me </p><p>for another party, that sprang from a door- </p><p>way one night, leaping for my back with an </p><p>uplifted knife. Nothing was revealed of </p><p>the man’s identity at the inquest, for though </p><p>I attended I was not called as a witness. </p><p> The instant I had shot I slipped into the</p><p>doorway for a minute, then came out, pre- </p><p>tending to be one of the scrambling crowd </p><p>attracted by the report; and I did not re- </p><p>main long enough to have the police get </p><p>mine among the names of those who had </p><p>been first arrivals on the scene. </p><p> A few other little incidents of a much</p><p>less menacing character than those just </p><p>mentioned had happened within the six </p><p>months, but I had no way of connecting </p><p>them with Thrope. </p><p> So I assured Mrs. Curwen that Thrope</p><p>had not, se far as I knew', made trouble. </p><p> She agitatedly assured me that he would.</p><p>She begged me to leave the city, for a time </p><p>anyway: </p><p> “If he is waiting like that—it means you</p><p>won’t have a chance. Please, please, listen </p><p>to me. I do know James Thrope! I know </p><p>every villainous drop of blood in his body. </p><p>He is the vilest man that ever lived! If </p><p>that letter had got to his hands-” She </p><p>flung her hands up to her face, and did not </p><p>finish. </p><p> There were tears in her eyes when her</p><p>hands dropped away, but she was more </p><p>composed in manner. She said that she </p><p>could never, never thank me enough! And </p><p>wouldn’t I please come again to see her— </p><p>soon? </p><p> She said one thing that stayed with me,</p><p>and things of sentiment do not usually re- </p><p>main long in my ears— </p><p> “I know Jim Thrope so well that I want</p><p>to treat you as my son!” </p><p> “Helen,” she said, calling to the young</p><p>girl that came past the door. </p><p> “This is the young man that struck</p><p>James Thrope in the mouth!” </p><p> The girl’s dark eyes flashed, and I saw</p><p>her body stiffen slightly. She was far </p><p>different from the pleasant, smiling girl </p><p>who had welcomed me at the door. </p><p> “Oh!” she said, and nothing more. But</p><p>she watched me steadily, her face expres- </p><p>sionless but hard set; and her eyes burned </p><p>strangely. </p><p> It was days before I could get those</p><p>people and that visit out of my mind, or </p><p>rather into the background of my thoughts. </p><p> There was not only mystery, but mystery</p><p>compounded. At the name of Thrope. </p><p>Mrs. Curwen had become a woman of </p><p>almost tragic intensity. I can not, and </p><p>never could, let puzzling circumstances be </p><p>forgotten until I have thought them over </p><p>Born to be Hanged, But— </p><p>9 </p><p>rom every conceivable angle; and the most </p><p>plausible conclusion I could arrive at— </p><p>taking the Bryan letter into consideration, </p><p>as could not be avoided—was that Mrs. </p><p>Curwen had suffered from some unusual </p><p>villainy at Thrope’s hands and had con- </p><p>fided with Congressman Bryan for what use </p><p>he cared to make of it politically. </p><p> Since the pickpocket had mentioned</p><p>“dreadful secret” and spoken of blackmail— </p><p>though he had been drunk when he read </p><p>the letter—I concluded that he had seen </p><p>possibilities of extortion from her. </p><p> All that was, in a way, easy enough to</p><p>settle. It really troubled my thoughts less </p><p>than the continual reappearance of the </p><p>dark, pretty girl, who smilingly had met </p><p>me at the door, but having spoken only a </p><p>monosyllabic “Oh!” stared at me with </p><p>enigmatic tenseness while I was leaving. </p><p> I could not imagine what it meant. But</p><p>James Thrope was real and omnipresent in </p><p>that little home; his personality shadowed </p><p>it—and yet, when I had first come in there </p><p>had been every indication of happiness. </p><p> I didn't understand. I did not greatly</p><p>care to understand, except in so far as I am </p><p>annoyed by the incomprehensible. That is </p><p>one reason I have taken some pains to keep </p><p>out of the way of women, particularly of </p><p>young ones. They all have something of </p><p>Helen Curwen in them: something enig- </p><p>matic, inexplicable, something that may be </p><p>taken either as sinister or as worshipful. </p><p> Whether she hated me, or was tense and</p><p>inarticulate from gratitude, for having laid </p><p>my knuckles in Thrope’s face was something </p><p>that could not be distinguished by her </p><p>manner. It might have been either. Which- </p><p>ever way it was. she was deeply shaken; </p><p>and obviously Miss Curwen was a passion- </p><p>ate, tense, volatile young woman. </p><p>Ill </p><p>L' I I WAS soon given some other things </p><p>to think about, though in a way these </p><p>J too had a bearing on Miss and Mrs. </p><p>Curwen. </p><p> Zellers, the pickpocket, more familiarly</p><p>known as “Hop”—probably an abbrevia- </p><p>tion of “'Hop-Head”—had evidently not </p><p>been so drunk as I thought. He had </p><p>talked, apparently, a good deal about “his </p><p>letter.” He had talked promiscuously. </p><p> The fact that he told contlicling reports,</p><p>and elaborated what the letter contained at </p><p>every recital, did not at all minimize the </p><p>interest his drunken blabbering had stirred </p><p>up in a most surprizing fashion. </p><p> I began to have people speak to me about</p><p>the letter. Some ventured to intimate that </p><p>they would like to read it. Two fellows of </p><p>Zellers’ stripe, with himself hanging sheep- </p><p>ishly at their coat-tails, came to demand it </p><p>of me. It was Zellers’ letter. Not mine. </p><p> I ought to give it up, et cetera, et cetera, to</p><p>the point of intimating that I had appro- </p><p>priated it for a little personal graft on my own </p><p>behalf. For fellows who had put on such an </p><p>assertive manner and talked at such length, </p><p>they made rather abrupt apologies, and </p><p>retired without knowing any more about </p><p>the letter than when they came. </p><p> What I thought must certainly be the</p><p>climax arrived the day after I had returned </p><p>the letter in the presence of a stranger who </p><p>introduced himself as Edwin Ellis and </p><p>asked for a private conversation. He was </p><p>obviously from the other world—the busi- </p><p>ness world. He had brains and a knowledge </p><p>of men in general, but I fancy that I added </p><p>a little to his store of information concern- </p><p>ing men in particular. </p><p> Mr. Edwin Ellis was a small man, neat</p><p>as a burnished rapier and much like that </p><p>most flexible, subtle and sharpest of all </p><p>weapons. He opened with commendable </p><p>directness, scrutinizing my face with flint- </p><p>like gray eyes, and perhaps wondering how </p><p>a young man of my age could have the repu- </p><p>tation I had. </p><p> “I understand,” he said in a straight</p><p>businesslike manner and tone, “that you </p><p>have come into possession of a letter from </p><p>the office of Congressman Bryan.” </p><p> A pause. His manner was sharply in-</p><p>terrogatory. I said nothing. </p><p> “Am I correct?”</p><p> “Go on,” I replied noncommittally.</p><p> “There is no occasion to go on until I</p><p>have assurance on that point.” </p><p> “Very well,” I said.</p><p> I was curious, of course. I didn’t want</p><p>him to get away without knowing why he </p><p>came. But the supreme schooling in Bluff </p><p>is had at the green table. </p><p> “You decline to answer yes or no?”</p><p> “I see no reason for answering yes or no</p><p>until I understand why you ask.” </p><p> He paused thoughtfully, not once shifting</p><p>his eyes from mine. I reflected that he </p><p>would have made a fine poker player; but </p><p>I guessed that he had probably chosen law. </p><p>10 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>It, too, is a fine gape for clever crooks. </p><p>An honest lawyer—that is, honest in spirit </p><p>rather than merely scrupulously observant </p><p>of what is called the “ethics of the pro- </p><p>fession—” will, I am sure, become as fa- </p><p>miliar with empty pockets as an honest </p><p>gambler. He was, I found later, not a </p><p>lawyer but a detective, and from the East; </p><p>so different from such detectives as I knew </p><p>that he had none of their mannerisms. </p><p> Mr. Ellis and I lapsed into silence. We</p><p>would probably have remained all through </p><p>the afternoon and all night, too, if he had </p><p>not at last decided that I did not intend to </p><p>say anything more until he advanced the </p><p>conversation. </p><p> He did, with customary directness, thus—</p><p>“I am prepared to pay you any reason- </p><p>able sum you may ask if you place the letter </p><p>in my hands.” </p><p> Figuratively, I sat up and took notice.</p><p>Actually, I did not let a muscle of face or </p><p>finger move. </p><p> “Reasonable?”</p><p> My intonation finished the question,</p><p>made it explicit: how much did 'he consider </p><p>the maximum of “reasonable”? I was </p><p>really anxious to know of how much impor- </p><p>tance, measured in terms of money, that let- </p><p>ter was considered. </p><p> With the air of a man who thought he was</p><p>Iriving home his bargain, he said— </p><p> “Ten thousand!”</p><p> I let a second or two pass, then barely</p><p>shook my head, but made no other reply. </p><p> That got under his armor. He ex-</p><p>claimed— </p><p> “You’ve read the letter—you know you</p><p>can’t possibly get more than that out of </p><p>it?” </p><p> “How do you know its contents?” I</p><p>isked quickly. </p><p> “I don’t,” he said as quickly. “But I</p><p>enow who the concerned parties are, and I </p><p>mow what they will pay.” </p><p>‘‘Concerned parties—how do you mean?” </p><p>“I will mention no names. No names.” </p><p>A pause. Then— “But how much will you </p><p>take to give the address—the address of </p><p>that letter?” </p><p> I wondered whether he was after infor-</p><p>mation, after the address on that letter, or </p><p>whether he wanted to find out whether or </p><p>not I would give it up; or if possibly that it </p><p>was a subtle play on his part to get some </p><p>reassurance that I did have the letter. </p><p>Again he might fear—or hope—that the </p><p>letter had got out of my possession with- </p><p>out my having noted the address. </p><p> I won’t give further details of the con-</p><p>versation. In much the same manner as </p><p>already related, I at last succeeded in get- </p><p>ting him to offer five hundred dollar^ for the </p><p>address, and I declined without comment. </p><p> It must be made plain that this Edwin</p><p>Ellis was no ordinary person. He did not </p><p>lose his temper, and he was straight busi- </p><p>ness all the way; but, having discovered </p><p>nothing of value, he prepared to go. </p><p> “Young man,” he said quietly but rather</p><p>impressively. “I did not believe a fraction </p><p>of what I had heard of you—I made in- </p><p>quiries before coming. I have rather al- </p><p>tered my opinion. You have brains, you </p><p>have nerve and you are stubborn. Of </p><p>course, what I want is the letter. But </p><p>there is some altruism in my pointing out to </p><p>you that any party or parties who are pre- </p><p>pared to offer a voluntary blackmail of ten </p><p>thousand dollars for the recovery of that let- </p><p>ter will not be likely to hesitate at violence.” </p><p> I thanked him, for he had been gentle-</p><p>manly about it. But I have heard that as </p><p>a child, as a mere baby, the surest way of </p><p>getting me to do something was by threaten- </p><p>ing to punish me if I did it, which, of course, </p><p>is only a kind of legend that my family </p><p>kept alive to illustrate a certain stubborn- </p><p>ness that has not wholly left me. </p><p> “Will you tell me this,” he asked with a</p><p>frank directness that I liked; “how much </p><p>more is the other side bidding for that </p><p>letter? Maybe I can meet it?”</p><p> I was tempted to tell him that there had</p><p>been no other bid; but he would probably </p><p>have thought I was lying—and that might </p><p>have led to unpleasant complications—so </p><p>I kept silent, beyond replying that I could </p><p>say nothing. </p><p> The situation had reached the intensity</p><p>where I felt it my right to know something </p><p>definite about that letter, or at least to </p><p>talk it over with Mrs. Curwen. </p><p> I weilt to her home. No one was in.</p><p>The neighbors did not know where she was. </p><p>She and her daughter had been gone for </p><p>some days. It was evident that the de- </p><p>parture had been sudden, for the neighbor </p><p>on the right declared she and Mrs. Curwen </p><p>were “the best of friends,” were always </p><p>running in and out of each other’s back </p><p>door, that Mrs. Curwen was a lovely wo- </p><p>man, and that she had said nothing of </p><p>planning to go away. </p><p>Born to be Hanged, But— </p><p>ii </p><p> So I went my way and wished sincerely</p><p>that I had had no scruples about prying </p><p>into the content of that letter. I could </p><p>have kept silent and lied. I am excellent at </p><p>keeping silent, and on crucial occasions I am </p><p>not likely to be called a liar—no matter </p><p>what I say. I tell the truth more frequently </p><p>than is comfortable because I have an aver- </p><p>sion to lying: for one thing, I don’t like to </p><p>give any man credit for being too formida- </p><p>ble for me to dare tell him the truth. </p><p> And then, too, there is something con-</p><p>temptible about lying—except when it </p><p>becomes magnificent, a thing that can hap- </p><p>pen to no man more than once or twice in a </p><p>lifetime, and then inevitably in connection </p><p>with some woman’s fate. </p><p> A poet, the one poet that I read, has said:</p><p> “If there be trouble to herward,</p><p> And a lie of the blackest can clear—</p><p> Lie—while thy lips can move,</p><p> Or a man is alive to hear.”</p><p> My own regard for women is not that</p><p>great; but my admiration for men who </p><p>have such a regard for them is excessive. </p><p>THOSE remarks have not led me </p><p>so far from my story as may appear; </p><p>but to get back to that letter: </p><p>Zellers waylaid me at every corner and </p><p>whined for his letter. I would not explain; </p><p>as well have tried to explain to a leech </p><p>that it should not suck blood. Naturally </p><p>he thought I was playing a lone graft, </p><p>and he became something more than </p><p>objectionable—a pest. </p><p> He circulated whatever report of me he</p><p>felt like among whatever crowd gave him </p><p>a drink. I did not greatly care about </p><p>that. What people think of me is their </p><p>own business, and I seldom interfere except </p><p>when they meddle with my business—at </p><p>such times I am at pains to correct wrong </p><p>impressions of me, for people who judge </p><p>me aright do not often try to meddle. </p><p> But when Zellers, accompanied by three</p><p>men this time, two of them recognizable </p><p>as liegemen of James Thrope, came at me </p><p>in a body and tried to talk what they called </p><p>“business,” I thought the time had come </p><p>to be firm. </p><p> I was told pointedly that Thrope had</p><p>“it in for me,” and that of course I knew </p><p>what that meant; but that Thrope was </p><p>interested in Zellers’ letter, and if I would </p><p>give it up, I could name my price. </p><p> I suggested that Mr. Thrope’s interest</p><p>could not be so very great, since he had not </p><p>come in person; and I said that if I heard </p><p>any more about that letter of the same </p><p>nature that had been coming back to me </p><p>through friends that had listened to Zellers, </p><p>I might give it up on the stipulation that </p><p>Zellers was permanently silenced—and that </p><p>I did not greatly care how! </p><p> The little malevolent rat was thoroughly</p><p>frightened. He knew that the methods of </p><p>obtaining silence in that quarter of the city </p><p>ranged from Chinese hatchet-men to an </p><p>overdose of chloral, from a blow in the dark </p><p>to being pitched with tied hands and </p><p>weighted feet into the bay. </p><p> Thrope’s men made their bid, a some-</p><p>what larger one than Mr. Ellis had offered, </p><p>so I imagined that, he having failed, men </p><p>thought to be more nearly in my class were </p><p>delegated to try their persuasive power; </p><p>and they retired with somewhat more </p><p>direct threats than Mr. Ellis had sug- </p><p>gested. I was under the impression that </p><p>Ellis himself was a Thrope man. </p><p> Zellers went with them, but he came</p><p>furtively to me later in the evening. He </p><p>was frightened. He whined as usual about </p><p>being a poor fellow who needed a little </p><p>honest money, and declared he knew that </p><p>I wouldn’t throw over a good friend like </p><p>himself. </p><p> According to his interpretation of our</p><p>“friendship,” which on my part had never </p><p>extended beyond giving him an occasional </p><p>dollar or so for drugs and booze, though </p><p>he always asked for the money under the </p><p>euphemism of “food,” we had been rocked </p><p>in the same cradle and maintained a sort </p><p>of Damon-Pvthian friendship. </p><p> “Youse ’undn’t trow me over fer dis</p><p>bunch o’ graf’ers, ’udju?” </p><p> I suggested that he tell me what was</p><p>behind all this effort and rumor about that </p><p>letter. </p><p> He didn’t know. He really didn’t. His</p><p>memory was none of the best and, having </p><p>been drunk at the time of reading it, he </p><p>didn’t know what was in the letter; but </p><p>his imaginative tongue had overcome that </p><p>little handicap until, by his report, the </p><p>letter contained enough specific informa- </p><p>tion to have convicted Congressman Bryan </p><p>of compounded felony and implicated any </p><p>number of other persons. He did not </p><p>remember the . party to whom the letter </p><p>was addressed, but it was a woman and </p><p>12 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>there was some kind of an intimate relation </p><p>between her and Bryan. </p><p> That information, of course, did much</p><p>to explain why such a persistent effort was </p><p>being made to get hold of it. </p><p> The report had circulated among the</p><p>tenderloin that Zellers had made a lucky </p><p>find of “something” on Bryan; the report </p><p>had percolated up into the ears of Thrope, </p><p>and he would have any day given an arm </p><p>to “get something on” Bryan. Political </p><p>enemies never were more bitter. </p><p> My interest in the letter dropped to</p><p>almost zero when I arrived at that con- </p><p>clusion. I told Zellers he had better make </p><p>haste to start a contradictory report, </p><p>because if the letter was produced Thrope </p><p>and his gangsters would probably be </p><p>furious to find he had so misled them. </p><p> He was shaken, but wanted to see the</p><p>letter. I told him that I had sent it to the </p><p>party whose name was on the envelope. </p><p>He wanted the name and received the </p><p>answer that might be expected. </p><p> So I thought the episode of the letter</p><p>was definitely settled. </p><p> Then Mr. Ellis again called on me.</p><p> He laid down ten one thousand dollar</p><p>bills, said— </p><p> “There you are, sir,” took up his hat</p><p>and started to go without another word. </p><p> But he seemed amused—not amused</p><p>exactly, but possessed of a great deal of </p><p>knowledge that he didn’t intend to reveal. </p><p>It was my turn to ask questions, and I did. </p><p>He knew as much about silence and evasive- </p><p>ness as I had on the previous occasion. </p><p> “Why the money?”</p><p> “It belongs to you.”</p><p> “Marked?” I asked, eying the bills. An</p><p>easy way to get a man into the penitentiary </p><p>is by marked bills. </p><p> “Examine them.”</p><p> “You could have kept a record of the</p><p>numbers.” </p><p> “Certainly,” he admitted.</p><p> “But why offer this? I told you be-</p><p>fore-” </p><p> “I am not offering it. I am leaving it.</p><p>The money is yours.” </p><p> It irritates me to be puzzled. I looked</p><p>at him for some time and said nothing. </p><p>Neither did he. I wasn’t in the mood to </p><p>play a waiting game: it was I who wanted </p><p>information this time. </p><p> “Tell me something definite—or take</p><p>the money.” </p><p> “Certainly,” he said politely, with a</p><p>slight, well-mannered trace of amusement. </p><p>“The party I represent—though very </p><p>severely condemned in certain quarters— </p><p>is a man of his word. The letter which </p><p>we know to have passed through your hands </p><p>has been placed in the hands of the party </p><p>to whom it belongs. Hence the price </p><p>agreed upon. I would have given it to </p><p>you before but I only lately learned all </p><p>the facts. I congratulate you, sir, on your </p><p>discretion and honesty.” </p><p> With that he went out and left me</p><p>standing there, ten thousand dollars on </p><p>the table and ten thousand questions </p><p>tugging at my thoughts. </p><p>IV </p><p>SO THE letter had been delivered, </p><p>but, I said to myself, the party </p><p>who received it had paid the wrong </p><p>person. That was something for him to </p><p>worry about, not for me. </p><p> Yet Edwin Ellis did not look like the sort</p><p>of man who would make mistakes of the </p><p>kind. </p><p> I tried to find out something about him,</p><p>but he was a stranger in the city. He had </p><p>stayed at the Palace, had registered his </p><p>address as “city,” and disappeared the day </p><p>following his mistake. </p><p> I again tried to locate Mrs. Curwen,</p><p>but she had not returned, had not been </p><p>heard from. </p><p> There was one way I could probably</p><p>find out something. I had thought of it </p><p>many times. I had even written and </p><p>destroyed one letter to Congressman Bryan, </p><p>who had returned and was opening his </p><p>campaign in the southern part of the State. </p><p>I came near writing another, but decided </p><p>that I might as well let the matter drop. </p><p> It was not really a decision so much as</p><p>the fact that something else of a different </p><p>nature happened which interfered with </p><p>my affairs. Some days later I left San </p><p>Francisco for a time—took a little trip </p><p>toward Honolulu. In fact, I was so anxious </p><p>to go that I went on a windjammer. I de- </p><p>cided to travel along about midnight and </p><p>passed the Golden Gate about dawn. </p><p> I had known ever since the little incident</p><p>with Thrope that the police, in their ver- </p><p>nacular, wanted to “get something on me.” </p><p>It is easy enough for the police to “get </p><p>something” on anybody, but they_ had to </p><p>Bom to be Hanged, But— </p><p>13 </p><p>get something definite and serious on me </p><p>to make a case of it. For though Thrope </p><p>was what is known as the “man higher up” </p><p>in San Francisco at that time, I was a </p><p>member in good standing of the gamblers </p><p>who gave the police and the “men higher </p><p>up” a large share of their graft. </p><p> It happened that “Spike” Delaney was</p><p>what is known as the “boss” of the under- </p><p>world; and Delaney was a hard-fisted, in- </p><p>dependent fellow who, though hand in </p><p>glove with Thrope, yet stood on his own </p><p>two feet and could not be worked over </p><p>like putty to any purpose that did not </p><p>appeal to him. </p><p> Delaney liked me; and Delaney—who</p><p>was just about as square as a man of his </p><p>position could be; which means little more </p><p>than that he was square with the people </p><p>he liked—would have thrown a wrench </p><p>into the wheels of any ordinary frame-up </p><p>designed to stow me in San Quentin. </p><p> I seldom played in tenderloin dives.</p><p>There were two or three up-town “clubs,” </p><p>known on the q.t. to sporty rich men and </p><p>their sons, and especially to tourists, where </p><p>I sat in usually. </p><p> And I must pause here to say that I did</p><p>not always or even frequently cheat. I </p><p>gambled first because I liked it, only </p><p>secondarily to make a modest living. </p><p>There is no sport in sure-thing gambling; </p><p>I mean there is no thrill, none of the thrilling </p><p>impact of bluff and luck as one studies the </p><p>inscrutable face across the table and </p><p>wonders whether to call or raise, or do </p><p>neither. </p><p> I must say here, too. though perhaps I</p><p>shall not generally be believed, that I </p><p>stacked and dealt from the bottom more </p><p>times for the benefit of fellows who knew </p><p>nothing about how their luck had changed </p><p>than ever I did for myself. </p><p> Despite what many wise card players</p><p>maintain, a deck can be stacked in the </p><p>shuffle—if there are not more than three, </p><p>or at the most four, players; but in a half- </p><p>dozen riffles of the cards I can put a good </p><p>hand at the bottom and deal it at will</p><p>though the eyes of twenty men are on me. </p><p>There is no way to tell when a good man </p><p>is actually dealing from the bottom. </p><p> There is one way to tell when he actually</p><p>is not: that is, if he holds the deck, as most </p><p>people do—and professional gamblers never, </p><p>unless under suspicion—with the forefinger </p><p>of the left hand pressed against the front, </p><p>and not the side—where the other three </p><p>fingers are—of the deck. </p><p> It happened that Delaney one afternoon</p><p>asked me to sit in at a certain table in the </p><p>back of his saloon. Some friends of his had </p><p>told him they were bringing on a “live one”; </p><p>and as Delaney’s best houseman was on a </p><p>periodical drunk, I was requested to make </p><p>sure that the fellow’s fat pocketbook did </p><p>not leave with him. Delaney had made </p><p>a similar request two or three times before. </p><p>It was pretty well known that when the </p><p>houseman went on a bat I would take </p><p>his place. </p><p> The table was put apart in a little private</p><p>room. Two other men, strangers to me, </p><p>but O. K.’d by Delaney, sat in the game; </p><p>then a fellow, a regular Delaney come-on, </p><p>brought in the “live one”— a Mr. Smith, </p><p>the name evidently being taken as a con- </p><p>venience for a little fling at high life. </p><p>IT TOOK me just about three </p><p>hands to discover that there were </p><p>only two poker players at that </p><p>table. Whoever had picked Mr. Smith </p><p>for a sucker, a greenhorn, had made a </p><p>monumental mistake. I knew it the minute </p><p>I saw him pick up the deck. He tried to </p><p>be awkward enough in the shuffle, but </p><p>the position of his fingers as he dealt made </p><p>me cautious about putting much faith </p><p>in the three fair queens that came into my </p><p>hand. </p><p> He played with that cool, steely quality</p><p>that marks the real gambler and can not </p><p>be assumed: it comes only after years of </p><p>tense play, and to some men not even </p><p>then. </p><p> I drew to the three queens, of course,</p><p>although it cost a neat little sum, for every- </p><p>body was staying. I was presented with </p><p>two fives—flip, flip, just like that. Smith </p><p>helped himself to three cards. It doesn’t</p><p>make any difference what the others </p><p>drew. </p><p> A modest bet was made on my right.</p><p>It was up to me to call, raise or quit. </p><p>I carelessly tossed my hand away—and </p><p>caught the expression in Smith’s eyes as </p><p>he saw me do it. I had wanted to see his </p><p>face—not his hand. </p><p> But I saw the hand anyway. Smith</p><p>threw it away—face up—and disclosed a </p><p>pair of tens. He had palmed whatever </p><p>else had been used to strengthen the hand, </p><p>if indeed he had not relied on the fellow </p><p>H </p><p>Adventure </p><p>to his right who took the pot without being </p><p>called. I saw Smith, however, dispose </p><p>of the palmed cards. </p><p> I did not see the cards, for one never</p><p>does when a skilful man has them, but he </p><p>casually reached out and touched the dis- </p><p>cards, and when the hand was withdrawn </p><p>there were three cards, one precisely on </p><p>top of the other. Quite good—and inci- </p><p>dentally, I made a note for my own future </p><p>benefit of the fact that one should never </p><p>deposit palmed cards in the discards without </p><p>pretending to gather the cards up. </p><p> Nobody would, with their eyes open,</p><p>ordinarily go to the trouble of trying to </p><p>fleece a professional gambler. But here </p><p>was a frame-up of some kind. Had these </p><p>men learned that on the day before I had </p><p>been given ten thousand dollars? Was </p><p>Delaney in on the deal, or had he too been </p><p>imposed on. Naturally the situation </p><p>prodded my temper. </p><p> The climax was delayed for some time,</p><p>but it came in an unexpected flash. I was </p><p>dealing: both hands were engaged. Smith </p><p>said— </p><p> “You’re dealing from the bottom!”</p><p> And a muzzle of his gun appeared above</p><p>the edge of the table. </p><p> As a matter of fact, I had not been dealing</p><p>from the bottom. I was caught unpre- </p><p>pared. There was nothing to do but sit </p><p>motionless, hands across the table, holding </p><p>the deck and a card that I had about to </p><p>toss. </p><p> “You tin-horn,” he said, “will you leave</p><p>town by train or by hearse?” </p><p> I glanced right and left. The three</p><p>other men at the table showed no surprize. </p><p>They had known what was coming. I </p><p>had been caught in a little frame-up. I </p><p>guessed that Delaney knew of it and had </p><p>insisted that I be given the chance to leave </p><p>town. </p><p> There is a peculiar psychology in crooks:</p><p>they knew I had not been cheating; they</p><p>knew that I knew I had not been cheating; </p><p>and yet they pretended to think I had so </p><p>as to have an excuse to order me out of </p><p>town. </p><p> I did not intend to go. I did not intend</p><p>to promise to go. I let the deck slip </p><p>quietly, at the same time raising my hands </p><p>and sitting back in the chair—straightening </p><p>up with hands raised, symbolic of surrender. </p><p> I had never advertized the fact that</p><p>I wore a gun across my stomach, for half </p><p>the efficacy of the device and position was </p><p>in the fact that no one expected it to be </p><p>there. But I couldn’t possibly reach for it </p><p>while covered. It would have been sheer </p><p>idiocy. </p><p> I turned to the come-on who had intro-</p><p>duced Smith into the game and said— </p><p> “Search me—so I can drop my hands</p><p>and talk.” </p><p> He looked inquiringly at Smith, and</p><p>Smith nodded. </p><p> He removed the gun from my hip, ran</p><p>his hand all around my trouser’s band and </p><p>tapped me right and left under the shoulders </p><p>for a shoulder holster. I sat with stomach </p><p>drawn in to do something to keep the gun </p><p>from accidentally coming in contact with </p><p>his fingers. He was satisfied. </p><p> I sat down, lowered my hands and tapped</p><p>my fingers, moving them about with nerv- </p><p>ous gestures that I did not feel. </p><p> “Now just what is the proposition?” I</p><p>asked. </p><p> “A train or hearse—and that goes.”</p><p> His hand lay on the table, circling the</p><p>handle of the revolver. A twist of the </p><p>wrist and a pressure of the trigger was </p><p>all that he need give. He had put the gun </p><p>that had been taken from me into his own </p><p>holster. It was a good gun. </p><p> Suddenly the table raised up, the round</p><p>top like a great buckler cutting me off mo- </p><p>mentarily from Smith’s eyes. But he fired </p><p>anyway. The bullet splintered through </p><p>the top of the table.</p><p> I had had to use both hands to tilt the</p><p>table between us. I had had to have a </p><p>tenth of a second of safety in which to </p><p>reach under the breast of my coat for the </p><p>gun. I don’t care how subtle or quick a </p><p>man is, he can’t move quicker than the </p><p>fellow with the drop can pull a trigger. </p><p> I was afraid to try to slip my hand up</p><p>under the coat gradually, for suspicion </p><p>might be aroused and another search made. </p><p>And it would have been inviting death to </p><p>have made an abrupt gesture. And though </p><p>it took me longer to heave up that table, </p><p>and the gesture was more conspicuous, yet </p><p>it was safer. </p><p> Any one who doubts need only sit at a</p><p>table and try the two movements. Smith </p><p>was used to men reaching for a gun: he </p><p>knew what that gesture meant, and the </p><p>moment a hand flashed from sight he </p><p>would have shot. But he was not used to </p><p>tables rising. Both my hands were in </p><p>Born to be Hanged, But—	15</p><p>sight, the fingers above the edge of the </p><p>table—but the thumbs were not. He </p><p>hesitated to see what was happening, then </p><p>shot—too late. </p><p> When Delaney and some of the people in</p><p>the saloon came on the bound, they found </p><p>two men facing my gun with hands lifted. </p><p> The man called Smith lay crumpled and</p><p>limp on the floor, face down—in a witch's </p><p>mirror of blood. Pie was dead. </p><p>I WAS cornered. The room had no </p><p>windows and but one door. It was </p><p>a small room, a poker room, and </p><p>the one door was filled. Delaney stood </p><p>in it, a gun in either hand and behind him </p><p>rank on rank of men—risking their lives for </p><p>the chance to crane a neck over the shoulder </p><p>of the fellow in front. </p><p> “Spike,” I said, “you’ve trapped me.</p><p>Shoot if you want to commit suicide.” </p><p> He might have been able to kill me—but</p><p>not before a bullet would have been on its </p><p>way toward him. </p><p> He started to speak, but I cut him short.</p><p>There was no time to lose. Quickly, </p><p>sharply, I told him that if he did not want </p><p>to commit suicide to turn around, face the </p><p>crowd with leveled guns and clear a way </p><p>for me, for I was going to follow him with </p><p>a gun pressed against the small of his back. </p><p>I let it be known that if anybody made a </p><p>move at me, I would get him, Delaney, first. </p><p> Spike Delaney turned his back and filled</p><p>the door, and he put a lot of feeling into </p><p>the words that he spoke to the crowd. </p><p> But there would be three men behind my</p><p>back the moment my face was turned. I </p><p>knew they were armed—or at least I never </p><p>found out that they were not. There was </p><p>no time to search. </p><p> “Down on your knees and face that way,”</p><p>I said, indicating the wall. </p><p> They went down and grotesquely as-</p><p>sumed an attitude of prayer. Perhaps they </p><p>were praying, as cowards do. </p><p> Then I realized that after I took five</p><p>steps out into the saloon I would have even </p><p>more men behind me, some of whom would </p><p>not be cowards. </p><p> “Step slow, Spike, and step carefully,”</p><p>I said and pressed my shoulders against </p><p>his own. </p><p> One gun, which I had recovered from</p><p>Smith, I poked against Delaney’s side; with </p><p>the other I kept the people through whom </p><p>we passed, not covered exactly, but bluffed. </p><p> Spike was roaring right and left.</p><p> “Can’t you see he’ll kill me if you don’t</p><p>get out of the way—get, you-!” </p><p> Spike was eloquent when aroused, but his</p><p>words were not choice. People in that part </p><p>of the town were used to obeying Spike De- </p><p>laney; and, too, none of those around about </p><p>appeared to be friends of Smith’s—and it is </p><p>only the police who go out of their way to </p><p>fight with the victor of a duel. So we got </p><p>through to the alley door safely enough. </p><p> “God, that was a clever stunt!” said</p><p>Spike when we had cleared the crowd. </p><p> “Drop those guns. Face about.” He</p><p>did. “I never thought you would </p><p>double-cross me,” I said. </p><p> “I’d ’a’ shot quick,” he said. “You’d</p><p>better go through. Keep up the bluff— </p><p>tell me to beat it back toward the bar!” </p><p> It dawned 011 me that Spike Delaney</p><p>did not know that he lured me into a trap </p><p>by asking me to take the place of his house- </p><p>man in that poker game, and I understood </p><p>why with so much alacrity he had cleared </p><p>the way through the crowd for me: he wa? </p><p>gladly helping me make a getaway. </p><p> There was 110 time to parley so I sent him</p><p>toward the bar and sprang through the </p><p>alleyway door and was gone. </p><p> Let some one who knows explain why it</p><p>is that a gambler always carries all the </p><p>money that he has. I do not know. I </p><p>only know that they all do it, and one of the </p><p>things I was long in getting used to was a </p><p>checking account. </p><p> My bank was my inside vest pocket. If</p><p>I happened to be pretty well capitalized, </p><p>I used both vest pockets and the hip. All </p><p>the money that I had was on me; and when </p><p>one is departing in a hurry that is the mnin </p><p>thing—money. </p><p> I knew that I had to keep out of sight</p><p>for a while. The three witnesses had been </p><p>there ready to have sworn that Smith </p><p>murdered me in self-defense; and they </p><p>would as readily declare that I had shot him </p><p>when he wasn’t looking. Such evidence </p><p>would have convicted a more innocent </p><p>man than myself, a man with less powerful </p><p>enmity directed at him from James Thrope. </p><p> Delaney’s friendship was valuable, but</p><p>he could not without trouble for himself </p><p>have bucked a combination such as I was </p><p>up against. Besides, his regard for me wras </p><p>one only of friendship; his relation with </p><p>Thrope and the police and judges was one </p><p>of business. </p><p>i6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> When I was younger even than at that</p><p>time, I used to vow that I would never run, </p><p>never be a fugitive. I swore to stand and </p><p>see it through—“it” being anything that </p><p>might happen. But I have run frequently, </p><p>far and fast. I ran that night—figuratively, </p><p>of course, for nothing would so readily </p><p>have started pursuit as for me to have been </p><p>seen flying along. </p><p>I WENT down to the water-front </p><p>and poked about cautiously. I </p><p>did not want to be seen, that is to </p><p>be noticed particularly, for I knew Thrope </p><p>would urge the police to “do their duty” </p><p>when he heard of what had happened. </p><p>But I was not without a few friends scat- </p><p>tered through the water-front saloons. </p><p> I have friends everywhere—I have always</p><p>had them every place. That does not mean </p><p>I am such a person as people are eager to </p><p>know and help, though outside of my own </p><p>family very few people have been ashamed </p><p>to have their names linked with mine; but </p><p>I like friends, particularly I like the so- </p><p>called outcasts, who are the best and most </p><p>loyal friends. </p><p> And I try never to refuse any man a favor</p><p>so long as he is not up to some sort of </p><p>deviltry that even my slack code occasion- </p><p>ally, but at such tunes rigidly, refuses to </p><p>countenance. I was young in those days, </p><p>and youth likes vivid phrases; so I told </p><p>myself that all of us, gamblers, crooks of </p><p>one kind and another, belonged to the </p><p>Legion of the Damned—and should go to </p><p>-together. </p><p> I have recovered a little from such</p><p>imaginative crudities; but in doing so </p><p>I have lost something irrecoverable of </p><p>the zest of life. This flickering of remi- </p><p>niscence is intended to throw a little light </p><p>on the fact that the reason I hovered watch- </p><p>fully that night at the rear of the Ship </p><p>Saloon was because the bartender then on </p><p>watch—as I could see by peeping through </p><p>the door—was one Sam Tyler. </p><p> Sam Tyler was a sailorman, who, recover-</p><p>ing consciousness after a free-for-all in </p><p>Delaney’s saloon, found himself not only </p><p>empty of pockets, but with a cracked head</p><p>and broken thigh. And because Sam </p><p>Tyler, who was a stranger to me, had pro- </p><p>voked the fight, taken on all-comers, fought </p><p>a good fight and gone down without a </p><p>murmur to accept the savage punishment </p><p>that befalls the vanquished in a bar-room </p><p>brawl, he went to the hospital—into </p><p>private room—and I paid the bill. </p><p> His sheepish explanation, made from lips</p><p>barely visible amid a swathing of bandages </p><p>had been that he always ended a jag with </p><p>a fight. But his forecastle days were over </p><p>the doctors said the thigh would always </p><p>be stiff and likely to cause pain. </p><p> So he had settled down to the com-</p><p>parative quiet of night bartender at the </p><p>Ship Saloon, where he could get all the sea- </p><p>news and keep in touch with old friends; </p><p>among whom, though I knew less of sailing </p><p>than a farm hand, he included me. </p><p> Three men were at the bar drinking and</p><p>talking. It took me some time to attract </p><p>Sam’s attention, but I was cautious because </p><p>I did not want him to be embarrassed the </p><p>next day when the police came asking after </p><p>a man of my description, if witnesses should </p><p>happen to be around to call him a liar in </p><p>case he denied having seen me. </p><p> When Sam found, out whb it was and</p><p>got a suspicion of wny 1 was there, he set </p><p>a bottle of whisky on the bar, told his cus- </p><p>tomers to help themselves and keep tab— </p><p>the last as a perfunctory concession to his </p><p>duty—and came to the alley, standing in </p><p>the half-closed door. </p><p> I told him that I thought I needed a little</p><p>sea air. </p><p> He told me that the Eliza Jane had</p><p>cleared the day before for Sydney; he could </p><p>have put me on to her and no questions </p><p>asked. The Northern Belle was due in </p><p>ten days, and he and her skipper were old </p><p>friends. </p><p> In my impatience, it seemed that he</p><p>mentioned every ship that had ever been </p><p>sent down the ways to a baptism of salt </p><p>spray; it seemed that he knew ali about </p><p>her movements and the personnel of her </p><p>crew, who her skipper was and his char- </p><p>acter, whether or not one could offer him</p><p>money for a “safe” passage. Such a pro- </p><p>fusion of sea gossip was maddening—al- </p><p>though I kept an attentive pose. I didn’t </p><p>understand what it meant. I did not </p><p>realize that he was talking of his great </p><p>passion, the sea and her ships—the strong </p><p>passion of strong men: stronger than love </p><p>of women, for sailors leave women in every </p><p>port to sing the ho-heave-ho of the creaking </p><p>capstan. </p><p> At last he thought of what a normal man</p><p>would have thought of the first thing. </p><p>Two of the three men in there drinking at </p><p>Born to be Hanged, But— </p><p>the bar at that moment were off the Jessie </p><p>Darling—the mate and second officer they </p><p>were, and waiting then for the captain. </p><p>The Jessie Darling left at dawn. She was </p><p>short-handed. </p><p> I protested. I have an aversion to un-</p><p>necessary manual labor; and I have found </p><p>very little of it that ever appealed to me as </p><p>necessary. </p><p> The Jessie Darling was a little schooner</p><p>recently out of copra trade in the South </p><p>Seas, more recently refitted and dressed, </p><p>and—well, he gave the history of the </p><p>Jessie Darling, but he was rather in ig- </p><p>norance as to her future. He didn’t know </p><p>who owned her. The mate did, but the </p><p>mate had looked wise and said it was secret. </p><p>Perhaps he did not know. Ships with </p><p>secrets are fine for trouble, was the infor- </p><p>mation Sam gave me with a sigh as if he </p><p>had remembered a childhood sweetheart. </p><p> He swore abruptly, jerked off his white</p><p>apron, flung it down and declared: </p><p> “I’m goin’ with you! To-with me</p><p>spliced leg!” </p><p> My bump of caution is enormous. It</p><p>always has been large. A hard blow over </p><p>the head will raise a bump and I had got </p><p>some buffetings that made caution promi- </p><p>nent in my life. Sam was for rushing in </p><p>with arms wide-flung and announcing that </p><p>we had decided to throw in our fortunes </p><p>with the Jessie Darling. However, he </p><p>merely introduced me as a friend and took </p><p>it for granted that I would soon come into </p><p>the conversation. </p><p> They plainly had no wish to cultivate</p><p>my acquaintance: a condition that I sensed </p><p>at once and respected. Besides they were </p><p>all a little drunk. Moreover, as they were </p><p>waiting for the captain, I thought I might </p><p>as well wait too and make my proposition </p><p>directly to him. </p><p> They talked and drank. I leaned over</p><p>the bar, sipping a glass filled from the pro- </p><p>prietor’s own private bottle—of tea—and </p><p>let Sam talk while I listened to them. I </p><p>was tempted into this because they so </p><p>many times dropped their voices into fur-</p><p>tive, loud whispers, and did so no doubt un- </p><p>der the impression that they were concealing </p><p>what they had to say from prying ears. </p><p> Caution and suspicion are two very im-</p><p>portant characteristics in my make-up. </p><p>So when I chanced to hear the phrase </p><p>“- old hypocrite” used in a way that </p><p>seemed to refer to the captain, and im- </p><p>2 </p><p>mediately followed by a prophecy that </p><p>he would be “shown,” I began to pay very </p><p>close attention, indeed, to the two mates </p><p>and the third party to whom they paid a </p><p>certain deference. </p><p> I gathered a number of things; among</p><p>which that the Jessie Darling was likely </p><p>to steer another course than that intended </p><p>by the owner—who was also to be shown a </p><p>thing or two. Just what the nature of the </p><p>revelation would be I could not surmise </p><p>from what was said. </p><p> However, it seemed that the Jessie Dar-</p><p>ling was being much sought after for </p><p>passenger purposes—the third man, called </p><p>Tom by the mates, was also waiting to make </p><p>terms for passage with the captain. The </p><p>mates were the ordinary tough-fibered, big </p><p>breasted men of the sea, neither of them, </p><p>I judged, under thirty-five. </p><p> The captain came in. He was a tall</p><p>saturnine fellow, with deep-set eyes and a </p><p>prominent nose and huge fists. He was a </p><p>sea-going man all right: grizzled, furrowed, </p><p>and hard. </p><p>PTHE atmosphere was chilled the </p><p>moment he came through the door. </p><p>The look in his eyes did it, the look </p><p>he fastened on the three men as he came up. </p><p> “Mr. Swanson,” he said frigidly, “why</p><p>aren’t you on board?” </p><p> The mate replied that it was all right,</p><p>that the owner himself was on board and </p><p>had him to come ashore on an errand. </p><p>With a drunken snicker he added— </p><p> “He’s got his girl with him.”</p><p> The captain was plainly infuriated, but</p><p>he kept very quiet. Only his eyes told </p><p>the story as he turned toward the bar </p><p>and asked for a drink. Swanson asked him </p><p>to drink with them, but the captain coldly </p><p>declined. </p><p> “Mr.Thompson—fren’ o’ mine—doctor—</p><p>for his health ’d like passage,” said Mr. </p><p>Swanson, laboring with an introduction </p><p>and embarrassed by something more than </p><p>whisky. </p><p> I remember having heard some place—</p><p>my knowledge of the sea and its ways is </p><p>vague—that the mate, though under the </p><p>direction of the captain, is responsible only </p><p>to the owner, and that a captain can not </p><p>dismiss a mate as he can any other member </p><p>of the crew. Obviously the captain dis- </p><p>liked the mate, and I suppose some strong </p><p>influence kept him from summarily ridding </p><p>i8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>himself of Swanson. As it was the captain </p><p>said briefly and with decision— </p><p> “No passengers.”</p><p> That was not pleasing to me.</p><p> Sam Tyler began to talk. He rambled</p><p> on: said he used to be a sailor and was</p><p> tired of dust and noise. Why, it wouldn't</p><p> take two cents for him to throw his apron</p><p> off and go to sea again! The captain asked</p><p> a few questions, a few quick nautical ques-</p><p> tions—but I did 1101 listen further.</p><p> Behind my back I was hearing Swanson</p><p> whisper:</p><p> “You come out between three an’ four.</p><p> I’ll have somebody on the lookout an’ stow</p><p> you away. An’ after we get two days</p><p>out-” The mate gave the captain a </p><p> look that indicated the events two days</p><p> later would be highly disadvantageous to</p><p> the captain.</p><p> “I’ll be there,” said Thompson.</p><p> He left.</p><p> The captain was saying to Sam:</p><p> “If you want to go as a boy all right.</p><p> If you are A. B. so much the better. I’ll</p><p> give you the rale soon as you make it.”</p><p> They left, and left me talking with the</p><p> proprietor, who grumbled and roared and</p><p> drank something stronger than tea, because</p><p> he had been awakened from sleep to come</p><p> down and fill the place of the bartender</p><p> who had gone a-rambling.</p><p> In saying good-by to Sam I managed to</p><p> tell him that he would probably see me</p><p> later, but for liim to keep his eyes and ears</p><p> open and his mouth shut.</p><p> I talked with the proprietor. I let him</p><p> think that I was going across to Oakland</p><p> and from there in an auto toward Los</p><p> Angeles. I dropped this information calcu-</p><p> latinglv, as if with no intention of letting</p><p> him divine what I had in mind.</p><p> Then I went to the pier from which I</p><p> heard Thompson say he would leave at</p><p> three o’clock.</p><p> I waited some time. A figure moved</p><p> into the shadows, detached itself presently</p><p> from the gloom, and Thompson looked into</p><p> the muzzle of a gun, gasped and raised his</p><p> hands with that suddenness which shows</p><p> good judgment on the part of a victim.</p><p> Then I backed him into the shadows for a</p><p> little talk.</p><p> Captain Whibley, I told him, was perhaps</p><p> *not such a fool as he appeared; and since</p><p> Captain Whibley did not care to have him</p><p> on the Jessie Darling it would perhaps be</p><p>well to explain to me—to convince me </p><p>why I should disobey the captain’s wish </p><p>in the matter and let him get on board. </p><p> I don’t know why it is that men, always</p><p>when in a position similar to that in which </p><p>Thompson found himself, say the first </p><p>thing— </p><p> “Who are you?”</p><p> I explained—briefly—that 1 had net</p><p>taken the trouble of meeting him to give </p><p>information, but to get il. </p><p> “That - - - Swanson’s give</p><p>me the double-cross!” </p><p> “Don’t be so quick to suspect Swanson,’</p><p>I told him. “You both made the mistake </p><p>of not taking Captain Whibley into your </p><p>confidence." </p><p> To make a short interview still shorter</p><p>I may say I found out the day of mutiny </p><p>and piracy and treasure-trove searching </p><p>was not entirely vanished from the sea </p><p>Thompson knew, or said he did—had maps </p><p>anyway—where there was a pirate cache </p><p>on one of the Ladrones. His idea was </p><p>with the connivance of mates and crev. </p><p>to take the Jessie Darling and find the loot </p><p>a hundred or so years old. </p><p> Hunting for gold on a desert island</p><p>never appealed to me as an enticing pastime. </p><p>I have gone on a treasure hunt or two, but </p><p>I didn’t intend to go on the Jessie Darling. </p><p>It was one thing to be dodging the San </p><p>Francisco police for a justifiable homicide </p><p>it was quite another to be dodging the </p><p>maritime police of all nations for mutiny </p><p>and piracy. </p><p> There was no doubt about the proposed</p><p>mutiny succeeding; two mates, and si.\ </p><p>of the ten members of the short-handed </p><p>crew were already acquainted with the plot. </p><p> I perhaps could have won the gratitude</p><p>of Captain Whibley by acquainting him </p><p>with the facts; but conspiring seamen are </p><p>good liars, and I had nothing to prove </p><p>my tale but a few pocket-worn charts which </p><p>I removed from Thompson. Besides, atten- </p><p>tion would be attracted to my own identity </p><p>before the Jessie Darling cleared the bay. </p><p> Once the police had their hands on me</p><p>I would be in for a trial. From the lofty </p><p>heights of his bossdom, Thrope would put </p><p>on the pressure and if I escaped with a life </p><p>sentence I would be lucky. Spike Delaney </p><p>could do much. I did not know how much. </p><p> I did not know how much he would even</p><p>be willing to try to do, for his business was </p><p>so intertwined with the police graft and so </p><p>Born to be Hanged, But— </p><p>19 </p><p>subject to Thrope’s approval that friend- </p><p>ship would not be likely to count. I pre- </p><p>ferred to go to sea. Having got to sea, then </p><p>I could meet the situations as they de- </p><p>veloped. </p><p> So, as often in complications of the</p><p>kind, I bluffed. It was easy. Thompson </p><p>thought Captain Whibley knew all about </p><p>the conspiracy. The Jessie Darling was </p><p>sailing before sunrise. </p><p> I took possession of the maps and told</p><p>Thompson it was lucky for him that </p><p>Captain Whibley was so anxious to sail </p><p>that he did not stay even one day over to </p><p>prefer charges against him. With that I </p><p>let Thompson go on his way—never to be </p><p>heard from again in my affairs—and I </p><p>found a launch and was taken out to the </p><p>ship. </p><p> The launch man did not want to put out</p><p>his lights and shut off his engine as he </p><p>approached the Jessie Darling, but a little </p><p>money is very persuasive. </p><p> As we came alongside a low voice hailed</p><p>us— </p><p> “Mr. Thompson.”</p><p> “Righto,” I answered.</p><p> I had a speech ready in case the lookout</p><p>knew Thompson, but he didn’t; that was </p><p>obvious by the way he took it for granted </p><p>that I was he. </p><p> “Where’s Swanson?” I asked.</p><p> “Sleepin’ it off. He an’ the old man</p><p>had words. Y’see, the owner’s aboard— </p><p>with his girl. Swanson’ll see you in the </p><p>mornin’.” </p><p> The man led me down to a stuffy little</p><p>hole. I found out afterward that it was </p><p>the steward’s room, but the Chinese </p><p>steward slept in the galley with the Chinese </p><p>cook. Two Chinamen can sleep in a </p><p>match-box and have plenty of room left. </p><p> The man left me, saying he “guessed he’d</p><p>turn in.”</p><p> His back was scarcely turned before</p><p>a low knock at the door set me tense. I </p><p>had hoped for an hour or so respite </p><p>anyway. </p><p> I opened the door, and Sam Tyler limped</p><p>in grinning. </p><p> Tyler—again at sea—had been too happy</p><p>to sleep, and besides he wanted to see if </p><p>I made it on board. So he had sprawled </p><p>under a boat to soak in the watery air and </p><p>watch. </p><p> I made my story brief and complete.</p><p>It was the truth, clear down to the shooting </p><p> of Smith and the need to go on the trip.</p><p> I had only told Sam before that there had</p><p> been “trouble” and I needed rest.</p><p> He whistled softly and grinned.</p><p> “This is goin’ to be good,” was his</p><p> comment.</p><p> “Who owns this schooner?” I asked.</p><p> He said that he did not know. He had</p><p> asked, but none of the men seemed to know.</p><p> He had heard, too, that the owner was</p><p> on board with “his girl.”</p><p> “His daughter?” I inquired.</p><p> “Don’t know—maybe somebody else’s</p><p> daughter. Usually is on mystery ships.</p><p> What’re we goin’ do?”</p><p> “Sleep,” I told him.</p><p>V </p><p> I DID not sleep late, but I lay in the</p><p> bunk long after I had dressed. I</p><p> had nothing to do but think, and I</p><p> let thoughts come and go as it pleased</p><p> them.</p><p> The bustling around, the shouting and</p><p> clamor, the creak of the donkey-engine</p><p> and the gentle sway of the moving ship</p><p> pleased me: we were under weigh.</p><p> A Chinaman, a Cantonese, came down</p><p> with coffee and rice about nine o’clock.</p><p> “What is your name?” I asked.</p><p> He shook his head slightly, but there</p><p> was no expression on his face: a rather old</p><p> empty face, and a Chinaman’s face can be</p><p> blank and empty as the inside of a scooped</p><p> cantaloup.</p><p> “You arc the steward?”</p><p> He nodded slightly.</p><p> “I may want to use your room for some</p><p> time. Here.”</p><p> I offered him a bit of money.</p><p> He took it as one takes his dues, and</p><p> without comment, without expression.</p><p> “Can’t you talk?”</p><p> He looked at me hard for some seconds</p><p> and turned away and went out, saying</p><p> nothing.</p><p> It is very easy to offend a Chinaman;</p><p> but it is not easy to offend one to such an</p><p> extent that he will show that he has been</p><p> offended—until some time later when a</p><p> hatchet or a knife acquaints one with the</p><p> fact.</p><p> I had always kept out of trouble with th(</p><p> Chinamen, which was the more unusual be</p><p> cause I knew many of them and was closi,</p><p> friends with seven or eight. They are—'</p><p>20 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> without exception—the cleverest gamblers</p><p> in the world, anti though this is largely</p><p> due to the fact that they are the most</p><p> crooked, they have the qualities of poise</p><p> and bluff but, excepting the Cantonese,</p><p> are not particularly distinguished for what</p><p> in the Occident is regarded as courage.</p><p> They prefer to meet a man from behind</p><p>rather than to his face: a Saxon doesn’t feel </p><p>that he has paid an enemy unless that </p><p>enemy knows who has struck him to death; </p><p>but a Chinaman’s soul, and the soul of </p><p>almost any Oriental, is satisfied with poison </p><p>or a blow from the dark. </p><p> About noon Swanson came down.</p><p> I don’t know what he was intending to</p><p>say, but I imagine something indicative </p><p>of surprize. He got his surprize from </p><p>another angle. </p><p> In about twenty words I gave him a</p><p>calling down that he could not soon forget, </p><p>pointing out that he was a fine fellow to </p><p>put any faith in—to go to bed drunk when </p><p>important work was to be done. Why had </p><p>he not been on deck to meet Thompson </p><p>and me when we came? Why had he </p><p>waited until half the day was gone before </p><p>coming near me? A fine fellow to have to </p><p>trust! </p><p> Where was Thompson?</p><p> If he, Swanson, had not been drunk</p><p>and asleep when we came he might have </p><p>learned. </p><p> Yes, I was the man that had loafed</p><p>around in the Ship’s bar. I was also the </p><p>man who was a friend of the bartender’s. </p><p>I was the man who had “something on” </p><p>Thompson; and I had impressed upon </p><p>Thompson the need of taking me into the </p><p>game. Swanson was invited to notice </p><p>that Sam Tvler was on board; and he was </p><p>invited to consider the matter of going </p><p>on with the game under the new deal or </p><p>trying to get out and save his own hide, </p><p>jn which case he would probably share </p><p>the fate of the captain of whom we mu- </p><p>tineers would soon dispose. </p><p> The lookout had not told him Thompson</p><p>came with me? </p><p> Of course, the lookout hadn’t. The</p><p>lookout knew nothing: he had said the </p><p>mate was asleep, and I had known that </p><p>meant in a drunken sleep, so the launch </p><p>had gone back without Thompson coming </p><p>on deck. Thompson did not intend to </p><p>come on deck anyway: he would have </p><p>explained from the launch. </p><p> The mate was mystified: but when I</p><p>showed the maps, he realized that I had </p><p>got pretty close into the confidence of </p><p>Thompson; and if I had not intended to </p><p>go on with the plot, why had I not carried </p><p>my story straight to the captain? </p><p> My procedure was a bit irregular, but</p><p>effective. He was nervous, uneasy, but </p><p>convinced. Besides, Swanson hated the </p><p>captain. </p><p> What about Thompson?</p><p> I suggested that Thompson had seen fit</p><p>to sell out his interest in the plan to me; </p><p>that certain persuasions had been made </p><p>which appealed to Thompson as irresistible; </p><p>that whenever I saw a good thing, I natu- </p><p>rally wanted to share. </p><p> “Is it or is it not a go?” I demanded.</p><p> He seemed to think I had the cards</p><p>pretty well stacked; besides he wanted </p><p>to even a grudge against the captain, and </p><p>he believed in the map. A sailor always </p><p>believes in a treasure-lrove map. This </p><p>one may liave been genuine for all that </p><p>I know. </p><p> It was never used. So, all things con-</p><p>sidered, and perhaps convinced that I would </p><p>be as firm a leader as Thompson, he declared </p><p>that it was “a go,” and offered his hand. </p><p> I ignored the hand and told him that</p><p>he had better walk a straight line. That </p><p>made him angry, of course. But I had a </p><p>better card up my sleeve than he suspected </p><p>to keep him from trying to do away with </p><p>me and getting the maps. </p><p> “Look here,” I said. “I know what is</p><p>going on inside your head. Here are the </p><p>maps—three of them. I have copies. I</p><p>have concealed them. When you find </p><p>them—the copies—it will be time to slug </p><p>me over the head and drop me over the side. </p><p>But not before. Remember, the copies— </p><p>very accurately made—are all that is left.” </p><p> With that I struck a match and burned</p><p>the maps under his nose, while his mouth </p><p>hung agape. </p><p> “There are a half-dozen desperate fel-</p><p>lows,” I explained lest his slow brain did not </p><p>fully appreciate the peril in which I had </p><p>placed him, “enlisted by Thompson on </p><p>this boat. They expect to go after gold. </p><p>The ship can’t be worked without them. </p><p>You arc their ringleader. If they find out </p><p>you can’t produce the maps, your life won’t </p><p>be worth a salted herring—and you can’t </p><p>produce the maps if anything should </p><p>happen to me. That’s all.” </p><p>Born to be Hanged, But— </p><p>21 </p><p> I deliberately turned my back that he</p><p>might see how little I cared for the boiling </p><p>anger that reddened his face and heaved </p><p>his chest. I don’t think he noticed that </p><p>I could watch him very well out of the </p><p>corners of my eyes in the' small mirror </p><p>that hung on the bulkhead. </p><p> As I have said, I am very cautious.</p><p>When I seem to be taking a chance I am </p><p>usually playing safe—dealing from the </p><p>bottom of the deck. </p><p> He contained his anger and went out.</p><p>I supposed he wished my soul on the </p><p>toasting fork of his satanic majesty’s chief </p><p>cook, but Mr. Swanson had given himself </p><p>a little lesson in self-control. Perhaps he </p><p>did not play poker, except in the crude </p><p>draw-and-bet manner of the win-or-be- </p><p>broken gambler, and so urffierstood nothing </p><p>of the refinements of bluff. </p><p>THE Chinese steward brought me </p><p>something for dinner. Withered </p><p>and wise and rather old he was. </p><p>And I imperturbably tried further con- </p><p>versation with him, and received no </p><p>answer. He watched me with a steady </p><p>scrutiny not at all reassuring—but one </p><p>can’t tell what is reassuring, or ominous, </p><p>in a Chinaman. </p><p> By night my hole had become unbearably</p><p>wearisome. </p><p> The Chinaman visited me again. But</p><p>I paid no attention to him. But he seemed </p><p>to me to hesitate, to linger. However, he </p><p>did nothing, said nothing, and went away. </p><p> I waited until it was dark, then went</p><p>on deck to stretch my legs. I was of the </p><p>opinion that I had been a little impetuous </p><p>in coming on board the Jessie Darling. </p><p>The situation was by no means clear, the </p><p>future not reassuring. It would be wrong </p><p>to suggest that I was afraid. </p><p> When I get into a fix from which my wit</p><p>and guns can not extricate me, then it </p><p>is time to die—and as long as I am not shot </p><p>from behind, my ghost will hold no grudge </p><p>against the man that sends me across the </p><p>Border. I was not afraid, but the need</p><p>for having left San Francisco did not seem </p><p>so pressing a score of leagues from the </p><p>Golden Gate on a ship pledged to mutiny. </p><p> It was no easy matter to stretch my legs</p><p>for the moon was bright and dodged in </p><p>and out among the clouds in a way that </p><p>annoyed me. I had not yet got what </p><p>sailormen call my bearings. The moon </p><p>made little difference in that though. I </p><p>knew nothing of ships. I did not leam </p><p>much about the Jessie Darling either. I </p><p>was kept too busy. </p><p> As I stood identifying myself as much as</p><p>possible with a mast shadow, I heard voices, </p><p>excited voices, aft, then a pattering of feet. </p><p>A figure scooted by me and shouted down a </p><p>doorway: </p><p> “Turn out an’ search the ship. Woman</p><p>hid—or overboard.” </p><p> I had been given to understand the ship</p><p>was short-handed. It seemed overcrowded </p><p>to me. Voices, harsh laughter and harder </p><p>jokes, rose in every direction; figures </p><p>scampered by, some with lanterns; calls </p><p>rang to and fro. From the poop-deck </p><p>I could hear the voice of Captain Whibley. </p><p>Questions and answers and directions— </p><p>and jokes—all around. And reports. A </p><p>man came by and Hashed a lantern in my </p><p>face; it was the man who had been de- </p><p>tailed by Swanson to let me—or rather </p><p>Thompson—on board. </p><p> I made inquiries.</p><p> He said she rriust have jumped over-</p><p>board. Sam Tyler had been at the wheel </p><p>and said he saw her come up and go down </p><p>amidships. Later he heard a splash— </p><p>thought he did. Listened, but there was no </p><p>outcry. Looked, but saw nothing. Sup- </p><p>posed maybe it was only a porpoise or </p><p>something. Must have been her. Ship </p><p>was searched high and low. No trace. </p><p>Old Man was furious—the captain, that is. </p><p> Was having words with the owner.</p><p>Cussin’ him out. Old Man could cuss </p><p>some, he could. Seems like she wasn’t </p><p>the owner’s daughter, but- And wasn’t </p><p>that kind of a woman after all. Seemed</p><p>like she’d been half-drunk or something </p><p>when she come on board. And sick. Saw </p><p>what she was into—and jumped. </p><p> “Who is the owner?”</p><p> “Don’t know, sir. Ain’t the owner after</p><p>all. Old Man—1 heard him—says, ‘You’re </p><p>a - liar. This boat is owned by John </p><p>Collins.’ They cussed back and forth. </p><p>Owner a big man with—” the seaman </p><p>swiped his cheeks to indicate a beard, and </p><p>added, “black.” _ </p><p> I was hot with anger, but I couldn’t</p><p>help anything. I could do nothing. I let </p><p>women strictly alone because—well, I like </p><p>them when they are not interfering with </p><p>me, when they are at a distance, on other </p><p>men’s arms. But I don’t like to know of </p><p>22 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>their being mistreated. I am cruel and at </p><p>times cold-blooded, but I don’t' want to </p><p>see anybody cruel to women, children or </p><p>dogs. I was never put to the test, but I </p><p>believe that I could without troublesome </p><p>regret shoot a man who beat a dog. </p><p> I know I would if it was a stray that had</p><p>ever poked its nose into my hand. And </p><p>dogs are third on the list—though perhaps </p><p>children are first—of the things it is not </p><p>wise to abuse if my gun is not empty. In </p><p>fact, I might be tempted in that case to </p><p>overcome a strong aversion to using my </p><p>fists on somebody’s face. </p><p> I reflected that it was perhaps well that</p><p>I had been on deck when the search was </p><p>made. Somebody might have found me </p><p>in the steward's hole—though I later heard </p><p>that the steward had made his own report, </p><p>and reported nothing. </p><p> I judged that I had better get out of the</p><p>way in case somebody might take enough </p><p>interest in my presence to carry a tale to </p><p>the captain; though, I understood later, </p><p>most of the crew knew I had taken Thomp- </p><p>son’s place. </p><p> I went to the hole. It was dark. I</p><p>struck a match and lighted the lantern. </p><p>It was a cubbyhole of a place. The bunk </p><p>occupied almost a half of it. The lantern </p><p>was smoky and dim, and flickered. I stood </p><p>for a moment listening at the door. There </p><p>was nothing to attract attention. </p><p> I closed the door and sat down and for a</p><p>moment, rather fascinated, watched the </p><p>lantern. It was spluttering away as if </p><p>embarrassed. I loosed my shoes and </p><p>placed them carefully by the chair. I am </p><p>methodical. I removed my collar and tie </p><p>and reached forward to the little shelf </p><p>under the lantern. I unbuttoned my vest— </p><p>and stopped. </p><p> There was some kind of a noise—only</p><p>it wasn’t loud enough to be a noise. My </p><p>muscles became tense and the cold, rigidly </p><p>icy contraction that always grips my body </p><p>at the first whisper of alarm, and makes </p><p>me appear so nerveless and calm, took hold </p><p>of me.</p><p>“YOU can’t stay here! Please. </p><p>I’m here!” </p><p>I jerked my head back over my </p><p>shoulder. A woman’s face peered up out </p><p>of the shadows from under the covers of my </p><p>bunk. </p><p> I turned around in my chair and looked</p><p>at her. I could not see her face very </p><p>clearly. I said nothing for a few moments </p><p>What is there one can say in a situation </p><p>of the kind? I could not gallantly offer </p><p>to withdraw myself. I had no place else </p><p>to go on the ship. I had as good reasons </p><p>as she for wishing to keep out of sight. </p><p>So I looked hard and long and my eyes </p><p>cleared a little and became accustomed to </p><p>darkness. </p><p> She was in that bunk with the covers</p><p>so ingeniously arranged that it would </p><p>have taken more than a casual glance to </p><p>tell that anybody was in it. There was </p><p>no outline of the body visible. The covers </p><p>had been drawn and bolstered evenly. </p><p>Only her face showed and she only just </p><p>before had drawn the cover from over it. </p><p>Obviously she • could not have made so </p><p>ingenious arrangement of them herself— </p><p>even if she had blundered accidentally into </p><p>the room. </p><p> “Who put you there?’’ I asked.</p><p> “The steward.”</p><p> “That Chinaman?”</p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> There is no telling anything about a</p><p>Chinaman. </p><p> A pause. I looked at her hard. My</p><p>back was against the light—what there was </p><p>of it. At last I was convinced. So I </p><p>said— </p><p> “Well, Miss Curwen, how did you come</p><p>to be on the Jessie Darling?” </p><p> She flung off the covers and sat upright,</p><p>agitated, partly frightened: </p><p> “Then you are that man! I thought so—</p><p>but—but you are in jail!’’ </p><p> “Let us not get excited,” I said sooth-</p><p>ingly—or tried to say it soothingly. ’You’re </p><p>supposed to be overboard and 1 seem sup- </p><p>posed to be in jail. How do vou account </p><p>for it?” </p><p> She told mev</p><p> I have found that it is usually wisest</p><p>to show surprize when you don’t feel it; </p><p>to pretend ignorance when you haven't it— </p><p>and the reverse, too. So I did not seem </p><p>surprised or appear to have heard anything </p><p>not already very well known to me. </p><p> Miss Helen Curwen was of the slim dark</p><p>type that are full of passions and wilfulness. </p><p> All women like to do things they have</p><p>no business to do; but not all of them lack </p><p>discretion, or, as a woman might call it if </p><p>she is one of the kind that does do those </p><p>things, the courage. The average woman </p><p>Born to be Hanged, But— </p><p>2 3 </p><p>feels that the world is cheating her: being </p><p>filled with infinitely more desires, dreams, </p><p>or whatever her urgent restlessness may be </p><p>called, than can ever be gratified, she lives </p><p>under a continual sense of repression— </p><p>until at such a time as with a kind of </p><p>volcanic folly she breaks loose. </p><p> The breaking loose may take the form</p><p>of tearing up a dress that she really likes, </p><p>of throwing a scalding coffee pot at her </p><p>husband’s head, or of throwing herself at </p><p>some man mother and friends have warned </p><p>her against. Incidentally, a sure way </p><p>to make a normal girl interested in, if not </p><p>in love with, a man—if he has any per- </p><p>sonality, good looks or suavity at all—is </p><p>to try to tell her that he is “dangerous,” </p><p>color his reputation with black, call him </p><p>those names that are sufficient to make him </p><p>an outcast from society. </p><p> Let those who willingly make a study of</p><p>the sex explain, if they can, why this is so. </p><p>All, or at least most, of my experiences with </p><p>women have been against my will. My </p><p>knowledge of them has usually come from </p><p>some such inescapable contact as discover- </p><p>ing one of them ensconced in my bed, from </p><p>which—as in this case literally, and in </p><p>others figuratively, so to speak—they poke </p><p>their heads to order me out of my own </p><p>room. </p><p> In this case I went promptly, having</p><p>found out some things of a really surprizing </p><p>nature. </p><p> I went to the galley and roused the</p><p>steward. </p><p> He looked at me steadily, quietly, but</p><p>said nothing. He made no reply to my </p><p>demand to know why he had stowed the </p><p>woman in my bunk; and I am sure that </p><p>he did not smile, though there were so </p><p>many wrinkles in his face that I could </p><p>not be positive about this. He said </p><p>nothing. </p><p> I told him what I wanted and, without</p><p>suggesting a threatening manner, conveyed </p><p>to him that an easy way out would be to do </p><p>it. I do not believe it is ever wise to </p><p>threaten a Chinaman. Kill him if the</p><p>situation requires—but threaten, no. His </p><p>duplicity is so subterranean that he doesn’t </p><p>seem to hear the threat at all, though he </p><p>is likely to accept it as a challenge to mortal </p><p>combat and win by poison subsequently </p><p>delivered with the humblest of smiles. </p><p> If he is a Cantonese he is more likely</p><p>to use a dagger, gently slipping it between </p><p>your ribs while you look upward to some </p><p>spot on the ceiling, or to some cloud effect, </p><p>that his esthetic perception points out. </p><p>I am not, certainly not, a coward, but </p><p>I never felt comfortable with strange </p><p>Chinamen or any women. </p><p> He said nothing, but when I had finished</p><p>he bowed and led the way. </p><p> I followed.</p><p> He indicated a door, stepped back and</p><p>hesitated. </p><p> I made a gesture of dismissal and added</p><p>a whispered— </p><p> “Thank you.”</p><p> Gently, as gently as if screwing the lid</p><p>from an infernal machine, I tried the door. </p><p>It was not locked. </p><p> Cautiously, slowly, soundlessly, I opened</p><p>it; inch by inch, imperceptibly, I opened it. </p><p>And when it was wide open I stood in </p><p>the doorway and waited—waited for the </p><p>man who sat in a kind of heavy resignation, </p><p>his face down, his arm thrown back over </p><p>the chair and a tall, half-emptied glass of </p><p>whisky in his hand, to look up. </p><p> He did.</p><p>I LIKE to make dramatic entrances </p><p>when the opportunity affords. I </p><p>like it for two reasons: one is that </p><p>perhaps I am by nature a little theatrical, </p><p>though certainly not melodramatic—there </p><p>can’t be melodrama anyway, without love </p><p>of woman; the other and more sensible </p><p>reason is that such an entrance is almost </p><p>like a terrific nerve-bomb for the other </p><p>person. </p><p> “My-!” he muttered, every muscle</p><p>frozen in fright, his mouth open, his eyes </p><p>staring in widened horror. </p><p> I said nothing.</p><p> The light was good, but an oil light, and</p><p>with the shadows of the passageway behind </p><p>me perhaps I did take on a rather spectral </p><p>effect in his crazed brain. The ship, a </p><p>wooden ship, with long steady rolls veered </p><p>from side to side, groaning and creaking </p><p>as if built of dead men’s bones. </p><p> He swerved abruptly around in his chair,</p><p>dropping unnoticingly the glass, which fell </p><p>and splintered, and continued to stare </p><p>at me. </p><p> He passed his hands over his eyes to</p><p>wipe out the vision, but flesh and blood </p><p>like mine doesn’t vanish so easily. </p><p> “You!” he said at last in something be-</p><p>tween a hiss and prayer. </p><p>24 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Yes, Thrope, you’ve guessed it,” I said,</p><p>stepping inside and closing the door without </p><p>taking my eyes from him. </p><p> Perhaps he wanted to fight, but he is</p><p>not greatly to be blamed for not attempting </p><p>it. I offered no menace, cxcept such </p><p>menace as he may have read in my face; </p><p>but if he read anything there his eyes were </p><p>better than my effort to show no expression, </p><p>unless an inscrutable lack of feeling and </p><p>purpose may in itself be called an ex- </p><p>pression. The tips of my fingers were in </p><p>the side pockets of my coat; there was no </p><p>threat in face or manner. </p><p> “You, you were—arrested?”</p><p> He half asked it, half declared it; that is,</p><p>he was having difficulty in reconciling the </p><p>conflicting evidence between his ears and </p><p>his eyes, between what he seemed to have </p><p>heard and what he seemed now to see. </p><p> “Arrested? What for?” I asked inno-</p><p>cently. </p><p> “They told me they had you—or would</p><p>have—or-” </p><p> Then suddenly, anxious to charge me</p><p>with a great crime— </p><p> “You killed a man!”</p><p> “Oh, did I? Thrope, you seem to have</p><p>me mixed with some one else.” </p><p> I was not playing; I was tormenting him.</p><p>The realities of the world, the things one </p><p>knows and has heard, on land, take on </p><p>almost misty distance, a sort of nebulous </p><p>mirage, if their existence is contradicted </p><p>at night in mid-ocean, when the slu'p is </p><p>devoid of human sounds; particularly when </p><p>the ship groans and wails—and a woman </p><p>has just flung herself overboard or, which </p><p>is just as effective, is thought to have </p><p>done so. </p><p> “You did!” he shouted at me, saying</p><p>it loudly to convince himself. “You killed </p><p>Smith. Delaney was crazy because—be- </p><p>cause—” His voice trailed off indecisive-</p><p>ly. Then, strengthened by a new idea, he </p><p>added—“Because it happened at his place!” </p><p> I understood. Thrope did not want me</p><p>to know that Delaney was indignant, </p><p>furious, because a frame-up had been </p><p>planted against me—and especially so be- </p><p>cause it had been pulled off in his place. </p><p> No Thrope would not want me to know</p><p>that. He would not want to believe it </p><p>himself. Delaney was a power, a political </p><p>power. He led the underworld to the polls. </p><p>It was Delaney who knew best how to </p><p>stuff and steal in a doubtful election, and </p><p>Thrope was anxious to be governor. He </p><p>would not want Delaney to be angry, even </p><p>though he could shake much of the profit </p><p>out of Delaney’s business and graft. Still </p><p>who could handle votes like Delaney? </p><p> If I had known precisely, as I did then</p><p>where Delaney stood and how angry he </p><p>was at the frame-up, I might have lain low </p><p>and remained in San Francisco, not putting </p><p>much faith in Delaney, but, so to speak, </p><p>less distrust. But that was all behind me. </p><p>Thrope and I were together on the high </p><p>seas. </p><p> I looked the cabin over admiringly. It</p><p>was capacious and beautifully furnished. </p><p>So the Jessie Darling was something of a </p><p>pleasure yacht. </p><p> A bottle of whisky and a piece of paper</p><p>were on the table at which Thrope sat. </p><p> “How did you get here?” he demanded.</p><p>Then quickly—“Won’t you have a drink?” </p><p> I read his thoughts—not his thought</p><p>either, but his intonations and expressions— </p><p>as plainly as if he had put them into precise </p><p>words. Between asking how I got there, </p><p>and the proffer of a glass of whisky, it had </p><p>occurred to him that if deftly managed </p><p>I could be arrested on the ship, stowed away </p><p>and carried back to stand trial. </p><p> The main thing, of course, in his mind</p><p>was to keep me from shooting before help </p><p>could arrive. I think that he was almost </p><p>beginning to believe that fortune had played </p><p>into his hands. </p><p> As he turned to pour out whisky for me</p><p>his eye fell on the piece of folded paper. </p><p>With a movement intended to be un- </p><p>obstrusive he placed his hand over it and </p><p>with a very awkward effort at doing nothing </p><p>suspicious was earn ing it to his pocket. </p><p> “Something I would be interested in?’</p><p>I inquired innocently. </p><p> “What?” And again and blusteringly,</p><p>as he rammed it into his pocket—“What!” </p><p> Thrope was given to blustering. He</p><p>seemed to think noise was strength. The </p><p>world would be full of Samsons were it true. </p><p> “Let me share your confidence, Thrope,”</p><p>I said, extending a hand of which the fore- </p><p>finger beckoned slightlv. </p><p> “Of all the-”</p><p> “Impudence. Yes. Let me see that</p><p>paper!” </p><p> “It’s personal. I—I—it’s personal.”</p><p> I replied that I didn’t care if it were</p><p>intimate, or what it might be; that I was </p><p>a very curious individual. </p><p>Born to be Hanged, But— </p><p>2 5 </p><p> “Have a drink. We might as well make</p><p>it up,” he offered evasively. </p><p> I said nothing. I looked at him steadily.</p><p>In about three seconds he handed me the </p><p>paper. </p><p> “You keep both hands on the table and</p><p>turn your face the other way,” I instructed. </p><p> He hesitated, but did as told. I did not</p><p>want him jumping at me while I was read- </p><p>ing. I wouldn’t greatly have minded </p><p>having him do so if I had not already been </p><p>in certain complications that would have </p><p>become more embarrassing through having </p><p>to explain how I happened to shoot million- </p><p>aire Thrope, candidate for governor—and </p><p>likely to l&gt;e elected. </p><p> I glanced at the letter, and I came as</p><p>near to feeling shame as ever I can. But </p><p>I began and read it. I read it carefully. </p><p>It was astounding. </p><p> “The envelope—the envelope,” I said.</p><p> “You know to whom it’s addressed—</p><p>you’ve read it before,” he replied half </p><p>leering at me. </p><p>fjjl IT WOULD have been useless to </p><p>L * deny the charge. I had not read </p><p>^ 2 before. I had not even been able </p><p>to identify it as that letter—but I had had </p><p>suspicions. So I asked for the envelope. </p><p>I really did not care whether he gave it </p><p>to me, for he had given me its equivalent </p><p>in his remark. </p><p> Perhaps I should have destroyed the</p><p>letter. I find in looking back over my </p><p>years, however, that I have seldom done </p><p>the sensible thing at crucial moments: </p><p>I have done the safe thing, or tried to. </p><p>I had some influence over Thrope as long </p><p>as I kept the letter. </p><p> He would have given a foot, leg and all,</p><p>to get it again. Besides, I rather looked </p><p>to Mrs. Curwen to feel more relieved if </p><p>she destroyed it herself—rather than heard, </p><p>even from me, that it was destroyed. I </p><p>could, too, understand her hesitation in </p><p>ever destroying it. A letter of the kind</p><p>is not the sort that a woman would ever </p><p>destroy—and then not without committing </p><p>it to memory. </p><p> I put it into my pocket.</p><p> “Name your price,” said Thrope.</p><p> “I prefer to auction it,” I told him.</p><p>“Congressman Bryan is not a rich man, </p><p>but he has friends. Then, too, a woman </p><p>may want to bid—and have nothing but </p><p>tears. Did you ever try to bid against a </p><p>woman’s tears, Thrope? What in - </p><p>would you have to offer then?” </p><p> Of course, he didn’t know of what I was</p><p>talking. All that got into his head was </p><p>the idea that I was going to auction the </p><p>letter. </p><p> He became excited and offered—it is</p><p>useless to repeat his insane sums. Anyway </p><p>he never expected to pay them, so he could </p><p>afford to talk in large numbers. He never </p><p>expected me to get off the ship with the </p><p>letter. All he feared was that I might </p><p>destroy it. </p><p> “By the way, Thrope, who was the</p><p>woman that went overboard—to get away </p><p>from you?” </p><p> I am all the time discovering that, though</p><p>most men are better than the world thinks, </p><p>yet some of whom I have the lowest opinion </p><p>are worse even than I could have imagined. </p><p>I don’t like to repeat his exact words, but </p><p>I believe it necessary: nothing else that, the </p><p>man ever did or said so vividly illuminated </p><p>the utter meanness and subtlety within </p><p>him. </p><p> Had I not known the facts even I—whq^,</p><p>was rather a sophisticated and suspicious </p><p>youngster—would scarcely have doubted </p><p>the truth, though I might have had con- </p><p>tempt for his callousness. He said with a </p><p>kind of careless regret: </p><p> “Her? Oh, a Tommy I picked up on the</p><p>Coast. She was full of hop and got away </p><p>from me—jumped the cabin when I wasn’t </p><p>looking.” </p><p> A silence.</p><p> I don’t think that I showed that I doubted</p><p>him. I merely waited. Nothing so much </p><p>as silence, nothing so much as pause, </p><p>jangles the nerves of even the hardened </p><p>guilty. </p><p> Then quietly I remarked—</p><p> “Helen Curwen never impressed me as a</p><p>girl like that.” </p><p> An explosion went off inside of him.</p><p>For a third of a second he looked as if </p><p>he was literally blowing up. He jumped </p><p>and quivered in every muscle. </p><p> This governor-to-be was rather im-</p><p>plicated in sometliing more than mere </p><p>scandal—he did not care for mere scandal— </p><p>if I should tell my story to the public. He </p><p>could lie, yes. His friends could he. A </p><p>mere outcast girl could have been pretty </p><p>well disposed off by lies; but there were </p><p>men courageous enough to investigate </p><p>the facts concerning a reputable daughter, </p><p>26 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>or the daughter of a reputable woman; and </p><p>there is one thing that constantly reassures </p><p>my faith in democracies. </p><p> Their publics never forgive at the polls</p><p>the debauchery of young girls, of girls out </p><p>of homes. The public will smirk and smile </p><p>and say “Oh well, no men are saints,” if a </p><p>politician is merely a rounder—but let him </p><p>even be suspected of having invaded the </p><p>sanctuary of the hearthstone—neither </p><p>money, lies nor stolen votes can save him. </p><p> But, of course, Thrope had the drop</p><p>on me, figuratively—or thought that he </p><p>had. Even if I got off the Jessie Darling </p><p>alive, I could be turned over to the police, </p><p>isolated by them, prevented from being </p><p>communicated with any but attorneys </p><p>of Thrope’s own choosing, tried before a </p><p>judge he held to heel and by a jury of the </p><p>court’s own choosing, convicted of Smith’s </p><p>murder, sent to San Quentin or hanged </p><p>without ever a chance to tell my story; </p><p>or if I did tell it, to have it reach none </p><p>but ears of the cabal’s own choosing. </p><p> Things like that had been done in San</p><p>-Irancisco; they have been done in every </p><p>city at some time or other. Thrope knew </p><p>all about the effectiveness of such pro- </p><p>cedure. What he did not fully appreciate </p><p>was my aversion to putting myself into the </p><p>hands of justice. </p><p> Much of my inveterate dislike of police</p><p>and courts, and all the machinery of law, </p><p>much of my often foolhardy efforts to play </p><p>a lone game, do what I think is right even </p><p>to lawlessness, may be traced as having </p><p>had an origin in the experiences and knowl- </p><p>edge of what murderous farces were per- </p><p>petrated around me in my youth. </p><p> “Helen Curwen,” he lied. “Who is she?”</p><p> The girl was supposed to be dead, and</p><p>I suppose he had thought there were none </p><p>to identify her, none who recognized her </p><p>or knew her, until I admitted a certain </p><p>familiarity with his newest closet-gkeleton. </p><p> “A friend of mine,” I said.</p><p> “How did you get on my ship?”</p><p> He was angry, but he was doing his best</p><p>not to show it. Perhaps he was wondering </p><p>again, as he may have wondered before, </p><p>just how ready 1 am to shoot. </p><p> A fellow who had led my kind of life,</p><p>and who has, on occasion, shot, has his </p><p>reputation magnified and distorted; but </p><p>such distortion has a wholesome effect on </p><p>men like Thrope. </p><p> “Supposing,” I suggested, ignoring his</p><p>question, “we call in Captain Whibley.” </p><p>Thrope swore and wanted to know if </p><p>that—oh, I don’t remember how many </p><p>kinds of-something or other—man had </p><p>let me on this private ship, which, so Thrope </p><p>said, belonged to him. </p><p> “Let the captain speak for himself. He</p><p>didn’t impress me as a man who would </p><p>lie easily.” </p><p>VI </p><p>CAPTAIN WHIBLEY came in. He </p><p>was big, with a gaunt dark face. A </p><p>very direct man, the captain. </p><p> He asked in so many words who I was,</p><p>what I was doing on board his ship, and </p><p>his general attitude was unfavorable. </p><p> Thrope fairly bounded to his chance. I</p><p>was perfectly willing that he should play </p><p>his hand first. </p><p> He told the captain, but not without</p><p>having edged into a position almost putting </p><p>the captain nearest my gun—in case I </p><p>drew—that I was a dirty tin-horn gambler, </p><p>wanted for murder; and that I had evi- </p><p>dently slipped on board the Jessie Darling </p><p>to escape the police; that I was trying to </p><p>bluff him, Thrope, with a cock-and-bull </p><p>story about having known the girl—or </p><p>rather of having pretended that she came </p><p>from a good home and wasn’t a Barbary </p><p>Coast creature. </p><p> Probably the girl was something to me;</p><p>probably she had helped me on board. </p><p>Thrope therefore ordered the captain to </p><p>place me in irons, and as owner of the</p><p>ship furthermore ordered him to go about </p><p>and head for San Francisco. </p><p> “I have told you once before,” said</p><p>Captain Whibley, slowly, deliberately and </p><p>with evident aversion for Thrope, “that </p><p>Collins is the only owner I recognize.” </p><p>“Collins is -only a bookkeeper for me. </p><p>I’m Thrope, Thomas Thrope.” </p><p> “I know that,” said Whibley, “but if</p><p>you were King of England I would be the </p><p>captain of my own ship—at sea. And sail </p><p>her as my owner directed.” </p><p> Thrope was set back. He looked it.</p><p>But his spirit soon rose. Whibley was a </p><p>firm man and turned his attention to me. </p><p>“You are armed?” </p><p> I barely nodded.</p><p> “Put your gun on the table.”</p><p> I barely shook my head.</p><p> “You heard me say ‘Put your gun on</p><p>that table!’ ” </p><p>Bom to be Hanged, But— </p><p>27 </p><p> Captain Whibley was a strong man, in a</p><p>way that a man is by his personality power- </p><p>ful. It was only with a psychological effort </p><p>that I refused. </p><p> “No, captain—not yet. I’ll break the</p><p>gun and give it to you at the proper time. </p><p>But I may want to plug that skunk without </p><p>having to search around for something </p><p>to do it with.” </p><p> Evidently he sympathized with my feel-</p><p>ing toward Thrope; and perhaps, too, he </p><p>recognized that I would not give up the gun. </p><p> “What do you mean?” he asked, firmly</p><p>but inquiringly rather than challengingly. </p><p> “Did you see the girl at all?”</p><p> “Yes. I saw her. She was very beauti-</p><p>ful.” He said it simply. </p><p> I did not tell the captain all I knew.</p><p>Helen would not tell him all she had told </p><p>me. Thrope would not tell all that he </p><p>knew either. Then I did not know so </p><p>much as I thought I did—-not even after </p><p>having read the letter which was carefully </p><p>deposited in my own pocket. </p><p> I will try to be brief, for important things</p><p>happened later on. </p><p> The captain went to Helen himself. He</p><p>questioned her, but not as a sea captain </p><p>might have been expected to do by those </p><p>who have rarely met the type of Whibley. </p><p>He was a strong and lonely man, with a fine </p><p>sense of justice and an implacable honor. </p><p> He returned where I kept vigil over</p><p>Thrope. And what he told Thrope did </p><p>my heart good. With dignity, without </p><p>profanity, with something of religious in- </p><p>dignation but no mention of God—for, </p><p>after all, such manhood as Whibley’s is a </p><p>higher religion than the maundering eye- </p><p>rolling of the self-consciously holy, who can </p><p>do nothing decent without calling His </p><p>attention to their merits—Captain Whibley </p><p>told the man of millions, the literal owner </p><p>of that ship, the man powerful and un- </p><p>scrupulous enough to wreck any captain's </p><p>career, exactly what kind of a dog he was.</p><p>And Whibley said that as soon as the Jessie </p><p>Darling reached port the full story of the </p><p>affair would be made public. </p><p> “And I'll ruin you!” yelled Thrope.</p><p> I touched Thrope on the shoulder. It</p><p>was something a little more than a touch </p><p>perhaps, for he wheeled involuntarily and </p><p>looked into my face. </p><p> “You forget,” I reminded him, “that</p><p>my affairs have first claim 011 your atten- </p><p>tion!” </p><p> It was then that Thrope appealed to</p><p>Captain Whibley to have me disarmed. </p><p>Whibley’s sense of justice required him to </p><p>make demands for the gun. I gave on&amp; </p><p>over to him. </p><p> “He has another,” shouted Thrope.</p><p> The captain asked if that was true. He</p><p>said to hand it over. I refused, politely </p><p>as possible. The captain, furious at this </p><p>defiance of authority, reached for the one </p><p>1 had laid 011 the tabic; but I threw back </p><p>the breast of my coat, and with a slight </p><p>jerk of my wrist he was covered. </p><p> I apologized, but I was insistent. In</p><p>fact I reached out and recovered the other </p><p>gun. </p><p> I was sorry for Captain Whibley. I liked</p><p>him. I would have liked him less had he </p><p>not been so determined to disarm me: he </p><p>had no fear, but turned his back on me </p><p>and walked from the cabin. </p><p> Thrope and I were alone, but we did not</p><p>talk. That is, he talked but I scarcely </p><p>listened. He was offering “peace,” he was </p><p>suggesting an “offensive and defensive” </p><p>alliance. If that story, which Whiblej </p><p>had declared was for the public, shoulc </p><p>reach its destination—Thrope’s political </p><p>honors would go glimmering, if his political </p><p>influence would not be entirely destroyed. </p><p> Swanson and four men came to the cabin</p><p>door. Their orders were to disarm and </p><p>bind me. But I—I merely pointed toward </p><p>Thrope and said— </p><p> “That's the man!”</p><p> With rough summary hands they searched</p><p>him, and found nothing of firearms; the} </p><p>bound him in spite of his raving protest- </p><p>and stowed him on the bunk. </p><p> I rummaged through Thrope’s effects</p><p>and found a gun. I removed one of my </p><p>own, took the shells from the two of them </p><p>and told Swanson to take them and the </p><p>report to Whibley. </p><p> The men knew very well that they had</p><p>not been sent to lie up Thrope. But as a </p><p>chief conspirator and a ringleader of the </p><p>proposed mutiny which was already due, </p><p>I was immune from their violence. </p><p>ygK THAT is, I was immune just then. </p><p>That night Sam Tyler gave me the </p><p>ship news. First, Helen Curwen </p><p>had been given other quarters than those </p><p>offered by the steward, and placed under </p><p>the protection of Captain Whibley. </p><p> Tyler had been at the wheel early in the</p><p>28 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>evening when Helen, frightened and des- </p><p>perate, rushed from the companionway </p><p>and asked where was the steward, the </p><p>Chinese steward. </p><p> “He promised to help me! To hide me!</p><p>Tell them you saw me jump!” She waved </p><p>a frantic hand toward the black molten </p><p>water. </p><p> Tyler thought she was fleeing from a dog</p><p>to a snake by running from a white man </p><p>to a yellow man. The average Chinaman </p><p>may be trusted implicitly any place but </p><p>at" a gambling-table and with a woman. </p><p>But this old silent steward was of a different </p><p>fiber than most men, white or yellow. </p><p> But the important thing that Tyler told</p><p>me was that the mates, Swanson and the </p><p>second officer, were spreading the feeling </p><p>among the ruffians that there was no </p><p>reason for allowing me to cut on their </p><p>treasure trove. </p><p> That meant a certain danger, but I do</p><p>not mind admitting that I welcomed it. </p><p> My room had been searched and I had</p><p>been watched. Swanson wanted to find </p><p>the copies of the maps. Perhaps he thought </p><p>I had too much sense to keep them on my </p><p>person, as that would probably be the first </p><p>place anybody would have the first impulse </p><p>to look. Perhaps he and his men would </p><p>have tried to overpower me, to search me, </p><p>when so ordered by the captain, but Tyler </p><p>had spread my name and reputation—and </p><p>Tyler had a vivid imagination. Too, that </p><p>name and reputation was not unknown to </p><p>some of them. Moreover, I had in that </p><p>cabin given them no chance to take me off </p><p>my guard. A man has to use up about </p><p>half of his life’s blood writing a record of </p><p>loyalty and true faith before I trust him. </p><p>I liked Tyler, for instance; I believed in </p><p>him, but I wouldn’t have trusted him very </p><p>far—though so far as I ever learned he was </p><p>as good a friend as a man could want. </p><p> I play a lone game—go just as far alone</p><p>as it is possible. </p><p> It was well into the morning when I lay</p><p>down, again in the steward’s cubbyhole.</p><p>I did not undress, for dawn would come in </p><p>an hour and I wanted to be up and see </p><p>what was going on, though I had nothing </p><p>in particular in mind to do. </p><p> I did not go to sleep. There was too</p><p>much movement about; not too much to </p><p>disturb sleep, but too much to disturb the </p><p>peace of mind of one suspicious as myself. </p><p>Feet were shuffling about, voices muttering. </p><p> A quiet rap came on my door.</p><p> I started to answer, but caught the words</p><p>back. The approach to the door had been </p><p>rather stealthy. I would wait. The door </p><p>opened. Whispers. There was more than </p><p>one person there. My name was softly </p><p>called. I did not answer. </p><p> I was lying on my left side; my hand</p><p>touched the handle of the gun that nestled </p><p>in a skeleton holster on my stomach. • I </p><p>was ready—or thought I was, but a terrific </p><p>blow fell through the darkness and nearly </p><p>shattered my right shoulder. I was at </p><p>once almost smothered beneath the weight </p><p>of men. I can shoot as well with my left </p><p>as with my right hand. </p><p> This dexterity has been acquired by the</p><p>left hand after long effort, chiefly because </p><p>it is the right hand that fellows, looking for </p><p>an excuse to shoot first, watch. But I </p><p>could use neither. I was in a bad way and </p><p>very foolishly struggled. A few years ago </p><p>a similar surprize was made on me, and I </p><p>pretended to be unconscious, and presently </p><p>two of my assailants were themselves un- </p><p>conscious—permanently so. But in that </p><p>cabin I struggled, foolishly. And I was </p><p>choked and beaten and gouged, and it </p><p>seemed as if my clothes were being literally </p><p>torn from me. </p><p> There is nothing, nothing that can be</p><p>done to me personally that is so infuriating </p><p>as for people to paw me. I don’t want </p><p>anybody’s hands to touch me at any time. </p><p>And when I am manhandled, my temper </p><p>swells up like the poisonous throat of a </p><p>cobra. But my gun had been taken away, </p><p>and I have no doubt but that the handle </p><p>of it is what some fellow used to strike me </p><p>on what he thought was the head, but </p><p>which was only my already pained shoulder. </p><p> I have never been knocked unconscious</p><p>more than two or three times in my life. </p><p>That was one of them. </p><p> When I came to I found the old withered</p><p>steward staring down into my face. In </p><p>his hand he held a tumbler of brandy. </p><p>Much of it had been poured on my face, </p><p>and some of it. trickled between my teeth, </p><p>and I felt almost strangled. I don’t know </p><p>how long he had worked with me, but he </p><p>seemed to think his duties had just </p><p>begun. </p><p> He offered me the rest of the brandy but</p><p>said nothing. </p><p> “Why don’t you talk?” I demanded.</p><p> He opened his mouth: he was a mute.</p><p>Born to be Hanged, But— </p><p>29 </p><p>At some time or other his tongue had been </p><p>cut out. In China precautions are taken </p><p>to keep secrets. </p><p> On board the Jessie Darling Yang Li</p><p>and I became friends. Eventually, in years </p><p>that followed, we were to become brothers. </p><p>I was to find that for cunning and loyalty </p><p>that Chinaman was incomparable. Why </p><p>he had taken a fancy to me then, I do not </p><p>know. I never did know. Not even </p><p>Chinese wizardry could foretell that some </p><p>months later my gun was to clear his trail </p><p>of enemies. But that does not belong to </p><p>this story. </p><p> I was washed and bandaged. My body</p><p>was sore, but I was not weak. I was </p><p>furious, but as my ferocity is never emo- </p><p>tional, I said little and displayed patience. </p><p> I asked if he knew who had attacked me.</p><p>He did. I repeated what names I knew, </p><p>but he nodded at one only. Swanson’s. </p><p> I was unarmed. He offered me a long</p><p>knife, refined of edge to a razor’s sharpness. </p><p>I took it, though what I know of handling </p><p>a knife is about the same as any other man </p><p>knows—nothing except to grasp the handle </p><p>and thrust. A knife in the hand of an </p><p>expert is about the deadliest weapon </p><p>made. </p><p> I ask him if he thought he could steal</p><p>the gun of mine that had been given the </p><p>captain the night before. He shook his </p><p>head and tried to tell me something im- </p><p>portant. </p><p> The mutineers had broken loose; but it</p><p>was not a mutiny according to the previous </p><p>plan. Thrope wanted to turn back to San </p><p>Francisco. He was the owner of the ship. </p><p>He was rich. His name was known to </p><p>every man. He was the big boss—and </p><p>he was to give them protection for putting </p><p>back, and later, so he promised, to fit them </p><p>out with a ship of their own for the gold </p><p>hunt. </p><p> The upshot of the tiling was that I had</p><p>been attacked and left for dead, not so </p><p>much to secure the maps which I was sup- </p><p>posed to have, as to secure the letter which</p><p>Thrope wanted. Events had taken a sud- </p><p>den whirl. </p><p> I learned all that later. Yang tried to</p><p>tell me, but he was not very successful. </p><p>He could write a bit of English, but I found </p><p>it hard to read his writing. However, he </p><p>did make it clear to me that I had been </p><p>thrown overboard. </p><p> Yang, Tyler and another seaman had</p><p>dumped overboard a form ’ made of a </p><p>blanket and weighted with bricks out of </p><p>the galley. </p><p> Captain Whibley, badly wounded, was</p><p>barricaded in his cabin with Helen Curwen. </p><p>The captain was no coward and he was </p><p>armed, but he did not stand a chance. </p><p>Swanson wanted to kill him and intended </p><p>to, especially as Thrope had much the same </p><p>wish. With Whibley dead and myself over- </p><p>board, Thrope and the crew could tell any </p><p>kind of a story and have it believed. </p><p>Thrope was not the sort of man who would </p><p>hesitate to take such measures as seemed </p><p>necessary to silence Helen. </p><p> The situation was rather twisted.</p><p> Yang painfully wrote out the question—</p><p>You kill him? </p><p> I found he meant Swanson. I told him</p><p>that I would take pleasure in relieving Swan- </p><p>son of further earthly troubles at the first </p><p>opportunity. </p><p> But Yang protested. He made me under-</p><p>stand that it would be a particular favor to </p><p>him if he were allowed the pleasure of set- </p><p>tling with Mr. Swanson. </p><p> “Can you use this thing?” I asked, hold-</p><p>ing up the long, lean knife. </p><p> He snatched it up. His wrist was like a</p><p>swivel. His arm flashed in and out and up </p><p>and down. Balanced on his toes, his thin </p><p>body swayed right and left, ducked, with </p><p>dazzling rapidity the long blade played with </p><p>thrust and feint. Then he stopped abruptly </p><p>and held his arm upraised, poised to throw. </p><p> “I guess you had better keep it,” I told</p><p>him. “Bring me a meat cleaver or some-</p><p>thing I know more about.” </p><p> He took my half-jesting words at face</p><p>value. I was furnished with a heavy </p><p>cleaver. </p><p>VII </p><p> STHE day passed.</p><p> The crew, naturally, got drunk.</p><p> It was quiet weather, scarcely more</p><p>than a breath on the ocean—and no reason </p><p>for staying sober. The sails were drooped, </p><p>the wheel made fast, and the Jessie Darling </p><p>meandered lazily. </p><p> Tyler wa§ drunk, too. I suppose he had</p><p>had to show good fellowship with the muti- </p><p>neers. But my private opinion is that he </p><p>did not try very hard to evade drunken- </p><p>ness. </p><p>30 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> I was patient. When there is no need for</p><p>hurry, I can be extraordinarily patient. </p><p>Besides, I had a headache and my body was </p><p>sore. I waited for night. </p><p> Night came.</p><p> Yang Li led the way, but he remained</p><p>behind me when the door opened and once </p><p>more I stood waiting for Thrope to recog- </p><p>nize me. </p><p> Thrope and Swanson were drinking to-</p><p>gether. What agreements and plans they </p><p>were making I have no way of knowing. </p><p>They sprang up, Swanson with a yell, as he </p><p>saw me, half naked and bandaged—a big </p><p>cleaver in my hand. </p><p> I was in earnest, and I meant it when I</p><p>said— </p><p> “Up with your hands.”</p><p> Why people think it is only a gun that</p><p>commands the respect of uplifted hands, I </p><p>do not know. A sober man would have had </p><p>better sense than Swanson. Thrope, drunk </p><p>as he was, raised his hands. But Swanson </p><p>attempted to pull a gun—my gun—from </p><p>the holster he had fastened on his hip. </p><p> He was slow as though untying a knot. I</p><p>leaned forward to strike—but a streak of </p><p>steel z-zz-zzzipped past my head. The thirsty </p><p>point of that flexible blade went into Swan- </p><p>son’s throat and pierced through his neck; </p><p>whence the thin wrists of Yang Li got such </p><p>driving power I do not know. </p><p> Swanson went over backward, his hands</p><p>clawing at the knife. His head, in falling, </p><p>struck the bulkhead, and he scarcely </p><p>moved. </p><p> Thrope gasped something about it being</p><p>me—again. </p><p> I told him that neither jails nor Davy</p><p>Jones’ locker seemed able to hold me. </p><p> “They hang men for aiding a mutiny,” I</p><p>told him. “The Federal Government—not </p><p>the tenderloin judges.” </p><p> I knew there was no chance of him ever</p><p>being hanged, but I might as well give him </p><p>something to think over when he would be </p><p>alone. I wanted him to do much thinking, </p><p>because I had qn idea that this alTair would </p><p>have to end in a compromise all the way </p><p>round. </p><p> I trussed Thrope up tightly, painfully</p><p>tight in fact. I wanted him to have plenty </p><p>to think of. Something more than mere </p><p>deviltry. </p><p> From that time on I worked quick.</p><p> The man who stood a drunken guard over</p><p>Captain Whibley’s door, and no doubt kept </p><p>awake only by cursing the captain and </p><p>making remarks unfit for the ears of any </p><p>woman, especially of her who was on the </p><p>other side of the door, went down with a </p><p>hole in his head. He happened to have </p><p>been one of those who had pounded me, or </p><p>he might have fared better. </p><p> The two mates left, Johnson and a young</p><p>fellow by the name of Robbins, were </p><p>alarmed by the shot and came to investi- </p><p>gate. Robbins was the fuller of fight—and </p><p>there was a chance of his surviving if he </p><p>should be removed directly to a hospital as </p><p>soon as we reached San Francisco. </p><p> Johnson did the discreet thing and sur-</p><p>rendered. </p><p> With a rope end in one hand and the gun</p><p>in the other I went on deck. Yang and the </p><p>cook followed, but they carried water. A </p><p>form that the rope could bring sufficiently </p><p>to consciousness to understand what had </p><p>happened was doused with water. </p><p> Three fellows of the drunken group*</p><p>around the capstan were sober enough to </p><p>fight. No time was wasted in argument. </p><p>It was stand to attention with a respectful </p><p>“sir” or get hurt, and the man who threw a </p><p>marlin-spike at me from the rear served as </p><p>an object lesson for those sober enough to </p><p>realize what happened to him. </p><p> I found Tyler peacefully snoozing with</p><p>his head in a bucket; no doubt the bucket </p><p>had originally served as a pillow. I gave </p><p>him some attention from the rope end and </p><p>knocked him down with the butt of the gun</p><p>when he came u'p fighting mad. </p><p> “Thank Gord it’s you! I wouldn’t take</p><p>it off no other feller,” he said as he sat on </p><p>the deck and rubbed his head to see how </p><p>big the bump was. </p><p> I told him that J did not know any more</p><p>about working a ship than I knew of ping- </p><p>pong, but if he would give the orders, I </p><p>would see that they were carried out. </p><p> It was a drunken and sullen lot that</p><p>turned to; but they knew very well that I </p><p>did not carry a gun as an ornament. When </p><p>they seemed sober enough to understand </p><p>that what I was saying was not out of any </p><p>fear of them, I let it be known that the </p><p>chances of their being prosecuted for mu- </p><p>tiny when they reached port—if they did </p><p>their work well in the meantime—were </p><p>rather slim. </p><p> I was perhaps taking a good deal on to</p><p>myself in holding out that hope; but I have </p><p>been accustomed to taking a good deal on </p><p>Bom to be Hanged, But— </p><p>31 </p><p>to myself at various times, and I knew very </p><p>well what I was about on the Jessie Dar- </p><p>ling. </p><p> Then—but not until the ship was under</p><p>discipline—I went to the captain’s cabin. </p><p>I made myself known through the door, and </p><p>with some hesitancy it was opened bv </p><p>Helen. The captain was rather badly </p><p>wounded and lay on the bed, covering the </p><p>door with a gun. </p><p> I told him that I had made a mistake in</p><p>refusing to give up my gun to him; that the </p><p>mutineers had taken it anyway so I had </p><p>been reduced to a cleaver, reinforced by a </p><p>very clever knife-fighter. </p><p> WHIBLEY had a broken thigh—I</p><p>think it was the thigh. Anyway it </p><p>was something above his knee that </p><p>overcame even his saturnine determination </p><p>to stand upright and walk. He did not com- </p><p>plain. He did not make a whimper, and </p><p>though he pushed away Helen when she </p><p>offered help in the futile solicitious way of a </p><p>woman touched by the sight of pain, he did </p><p>it with a strange gentleness. There was no </p><p>doubt as to how she regarded him. </p><p> He asked bluntly if I had killed Thrope.</p><p> I told him my story. Helen had already</p><p>told him hers. I do not think she told him </p><p>the contents of the letter—but she men- </p><p>tioned it in my presence. </p><p> I left the cabin so abruptly that they must</p><p>have thought I had suddenly gone mad. </p><p> High and low I searched for that letter.</p><p>It contained a secret, a woman’s secret— </p><p>more than a woman’s secret, really the </p><p>destiny of more than one person. It is an </p><p>awful thing to find the decisive factor of a </p><p>person’s destiny put down on a little bit of </p><p>paper that may be shifted from hand to </p><p>hand, and I was determined to get it if pos- </p><p>sible. </p><p> It was not possible. The body of Swan-</p><p>son had been put overboard. The seamen </p><p>had plundered his pockets—as is not un- </p><p>usual, I believe, among such men as will try </p><p>a mutiny when one of their number goes</p><p>down; but there was no getting trace of the </p><p>letter. </p><p> I questioned Thrope, who writhed in pain,</p><p>in obvious pain. But he denied all knowl- </p><p>edge of the letter. For one of the few times </p><p>in my life, I was deceived by a man’s lies— </p><p>deceived when I looked right at him. But </p><p>I was deceived, though not so much that I </p><p>neglected to search him and to search his </p><p>cabin. However, I believed the letter was </p><p>gone. There was every reason to think that </p><p>it had gone, either overboard with Swanson </p><p>or been cast aside unthinkingly by any one </p><p>of the crew that chanced to I'md it. </p><p> I had a talk with Thrope, and we came</p><p>to an understanding. </p><p> He was to forget that I shot and killed</p><p>his imported gunman, Smith; a gambler and </p><p>dead-shot from Seattle brought down for </p><p>the express purpose of running me out of </p><p>San Francisco. As an aid to his forgetful- </p><p>ness he wrote out and signed a statement </p><p>to the effect that he had often heard Smith </p><p>say he would kill me. That Thrope had </p><p>paid Smith to do this did not appear in the </p><p>statement, but it was a sufficiently strong </p><p>statement to give me evidence of self-de- </p><p>fense. </p><p> Of course, its real importance lay in the</p><p>fact that so long as I had it, Thrope would </p><p>bring pressure to bear to keep me from </p><p>being arrested and tried—or at least con^ </p><p>victed. </p><p> In return, I was to say nothing about his</p><p>damnable conduct toward Helen Curwen. I </p><p>was tempted to this less for my own safety </p><p>than on her own behalf, though I also had </p><p>Captain Whibley in mind. </p><p> The situation was simply this: Helen was</p><p>not only a fine girl, tinctured with the folly </p><p>congenital to all girls, but any exploitation </p><p>of her shame would rebound to Mrs. Cur- </p><p>wen and strike again at Congressman </p><p>Bryan—Thrope’s rival for the governor- </p><p>ship. So in making the scandal public to </p><p>injure Thrope’s candidacy, that of Bryan’s </p><p>would also be—if not blackened, at least </p><p>hurt. </p><p> The letter which had caused so much</p><p>concern, and about which all events had</p><p>pivoted, was from Congressman Bryan to </p><p>Mrs. Curwen. The letter was not clear, by </p><p>any means. It had evidently been written </p><p>for Mrs. Curwen "s birthday, and it was a </p><p>letter of gratitude and love from a son to a </p><p>mother, who appreciated her great love and </p><p>sacrifices on behalf of his career; to a mother </p><p>who had deliberately kept herself in the </p><p>shadows, secretly, almost furtively, cheer- </p><p>ing and aiding her boy, willing—the letter </p><p>said—“to make all of the sacrifices of </p><p>motherhood, without publicly claiming any </p><p>of the honors.” </p><p> I judged, and the author, Congressman</p><p>Bryan, evidently believed, that he had been </p><p>born fatherless, and that Mrs. Curwen, </p><p>32 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>rather than let such stigma cling to him had </p><p>made arrangements for putting him into </p><p>the world as a foundling. </p><p> I did not understand this at all. But it</p><p>was not my business to understand. I </p><p>could not see why, since she called herself a </p><p>Mrs. and acknowledged Helen as a daugh- </p><p>ter, this brilliant son had not been given </p><p>a home and name. </p><p> But people work out their own lives in</p><p>their own way, and some of them do not </p><p>make such mistakes as some of us, catching </p><p>only furtive and half-revealed glances, </p><p>think. </p><p> For another tiling, in our compromise,</p><p>Thrope agreed to hold no grudge against </p><p>Whibley. I impressed upon him that this </p><p>last was an agreement in which I had taken </p><p>a very strong personal interest. Whibley </p><p>was the type of man I will go far from my </p><p>path any time to help. I intimated to </p><p>Thrope that any interference with Whib- </p><p>ley’s career would be pressure on my toes, </p><p>and he knew that I very much resented </p><p>having my feet stepped on. </p><p> I let him up and he sat at the table ca-</p><p>ressing his bottle of whisky between glasses, </p><p>feeling not at all ashamed of what he had </p><p>gone through with and been exposed in, </p><p>but rather pleased to think an “amiable” </p><p>understanding had been reached that pro- </p><p>tected every one. </p><p> Without anger, but with evident dis-</p><p>taste, I tried to tell Thrope just what man- </p><p>ner of man he was and what I thought of </p><p>him. It is needless to repeat: I simply said </p><p>in a few words what I have been making </p><p>clear. But even I did not know, did not </p><p>suspect the worst about him. Had I done </p><p>so, I believe I would have killed him. </p><p> I know that I would have killed him—</p><p>tossed him a gun and invited him to try </p><p>to shoot first. 1 might have let him fire the </p><p>first shot. I have done so on rare occasions </p><p>when I was perfectly willing to go down </p><p>in return for the satisfaction of being able, </p><p>honorably, to murder a ruffian. </p><p> The man does not live who can shoot so</p><p>(uick or hit me in a spot so deadly that, in </p><p>such a duel as I mention, I can not—if with </p><p>nothing more than muscular reflex action— </p><p>shoot in return; and there are seconds when </p><p>I can not miss. </p><p> I must qualify that slightly: there is one</p><p>spot which would be fatal to me in such cir- </p><p>cumstances, but it is not head or heart. It </p><p>is the wrist, for a broken wrist would cut off </p><p>the muscular reaction: that is one reason I </p><p>have broken more gun-men’s wrists than </p><p>probably any other so-called gun-fighter on </p><p>the Coast. Some people think that I have </p><p>broken wrists because I hesitated to kill </p><p>even human vermin. </p><p> But to return to Thrope. In the light of</p><p>subsequent events, I will be bold enough to </p><p>say that I would even have stooped to </p><p>shoot him in the back, if in no other way I </p><p>could have prevented what presently came </p><p>to pass. That is, of course, if I had had pro- </p><p>phetic vision and known what was going to </p><p>happen. </p><p> He kept faith with me regarding the</p><p>agreements about myself and Captain </p><p>Whibley. It was something else, something </p><p>ten times more inconceivably vile; nor did </p><p>it directly concern Helen Curwen. </p><p> Thrope had reasons for keeping his eye</p><p>on Mrs. Curwen. She was really Mrs. Cur- </p><p>wen, and Curwen was less than five years </p><p>dead. </p><p> Helen was her daughter. Thrope had</p><p>remarked the beauty of Helen. He had </p><p>insidiously and secretly become acquainted </p><p>with her, flattered her, turned her head, </p><p>promised—I don’t know what all—and ex- </p><p>plained in some ingeniously specious way </p><p>why Mrs. Curwen hated him so much. </p><p> Helen Curwen did not know the truth—</p><p>not until after she had, at Thrope’s instiga- </p><p>tion, stolen the letter which I returned to </p><p>Mrs. Curwen. She had read it but not </p><p>understood, scarcely suspected what it </p><p>really meant until on board the Jessie Dar- </p><p>ling, when Thrope, gleefully, had made it </p><p>clear. </p><p> Helen had been frightfully shocked; the</p><p>idea that her mother had a “past” cut so </p><p>deeply that it awakened her to her own</p><p>folly, and in desperation she had appealed— </p><p>for lack of any one else to whom she could </p><p>appeal—to Yang Li; and that wily, wise </p><p>old Chinaman showed himself a human </p><p>being. </p><p> Being a reader of character, as most if not</p><p>all Chinamen are, he thrust the girl unan- </p><p>nounced under my protection; and that I </p><p>came near failing in giving her the needed </p><p>protection was not the fault of Yang Li. </p><p> The hardest part of the effort to effect a</p><p>general compromise and secrecy of what </p><p>had happened was with Captain Whibley. </p><p>He swore by all the gods of a seaman that </p><p>Thrope should be brought to the bar for his </p><p>wickedness toward Helen. </p><p>, Bom to be Hanged, But- </p><p>33 </p><p> A simple-hearted old sea captain—he be-</p><p>lieved in justice and the honor of courts. </p><p>It was with difficulty I impressed the truth </p><p>upon him; then he was incredulous. But </p><p>he yielded to the appeal of protecting </p><p>Helen, her name, her future. That touched </p><p>him. He agreed. </p><p> So I helped Captain Whibley on to tire</p><p>quarter-dee!.; and Tyler—as good a man as </p><p>could be found in the forecastle on any </p><p>ship for holding a course—took the wheel; </p><p>Thxope stood by himself at the windward </p><p>-ail, and Helen and I remained by the cap- </p><p>tain—and we came back through the </p><p>Golden Gate. </p><p>VIH </p><p>a THE next day the papers had quite </p><p>a story, and told everything but the </p><p>truth. My name appeared conspicu- </p><p>ously, for this was in a way what is called </p><p>a “follow-up” story on the Smith affair, in </p><p>which I had been referred to as the “no- </p><p>torious” et cetera. But I was not called </p><p>the “notorious” et cetera in the papers which </p><p>Thrope influenced upon my return. </p><p> No. “New facts had been discovered”</p><p>which showed that I shot in self-defense. </p><p>The three witnesses of the gambling game </p><p>admitted that they lied, that the whole was </p><p>a frame-up. I was not even to be arrested. </p><p>The three witnesses had been arrested for </p><p>perjury before the coroner’s jury—such is </p><p>the way, in graft and politics, henchmen are </p><p>broken and thrown to the scrap-heap. True </p><p>enough, they escaped prison, but they were </p><p>scapegoats. </p><p> The dead seamen took the blame of the</p><p>mutiny on the Jessie Darling, and Thrope, </p><p>Whibley and myself had made a glorious </p><p>fight against them. Not a word about Yang </p><p>Li. Oh well, he never cared for publicity, </p><p>any way. </p><p> And how was the name of Helen Curwen</p><p>cleared? With unsuspected brilliancy. I </p><p>read it two times and remained incredulous. </p><p>She was Mrs. Captain Whibley, making her </p><p>honeymoon voyage with the captain. And </p><p>so far as anybody ever found out to the </p><p>contrary—excepting, of course—Mrs. Cur-</p><p>wen—that was true. Helen and Captain </p><p>Whibley were in love and they did marry </p><p>in a way that interfered not at all with the </p><p>rather premature announcement. </p><p>Thrope, as a friend of the bride and of </p><p>the captain, had intended to take a little sea- </p><p>3 </p><p>voyage to Honolulu and back before enter- </p><p>ing upon the last lap of his campaign. He </p><p>had needed the rest. That was precisely </p><p>what he had intended, for he felt certain </p><p>that the letter would be a bombshell in the </p><p>camp of Bryan, and he, Thrope, could afford </p><p>the leisure of a sea trip even as a crucial </p><p>moment of the campaign. </p><p> About the only two people I met who did</p><p>not appear satisfied were Mrs. Curwen and </p><p>Delaney. </p><p> Delaney almost wept. Then he swore</p><p>loud and fervently. He cursed me for hav- </p><p>ing ever suspected that' he would give a </p><p>friend a double-cross. I took his statement </p><p>with sufficient salt to make it palatable and </p><p>said nothing to ease his resentment against </p><p>Thrope. </p><p> Much of that resentment was genuine.</p><p>It had hurt Delaney’s pride—however much </p><p>or little it had hurt his honor—to think that </p><p>anybody, even Thrope and the police, would </p><p>arrange a frame-up against his friend in his </p><p>own saloon. </p><p> He was angry. He asked if I thought I</p><p>could ever have “got away” with the bluff </p><p>I worked to get from the saloon if he had </p><p>not willingly aided? I remarked that I </p><p>probably could not have got away as easily </p><p>as I had done if he had not been so agree- </p><p>able, but that I would have shot—and he </p><p>knew it. </p><p> But at that, I believe Delaney was more</p><p>sincere than 1 really wanted to give him </p><p>credit for. I am suspicious of everybody. </p><p>Particularly of my friends. </p><p> I went to see Mrs. Curwen.</p><p> She was very distressed and*showed it.</p><p>Age seemed to have come suddenly-to claim </p><p>his full debt and interest. </p><p> “I am desperate—desperate,” she said.</p><p>Again and again she repeated that, remark- </p><p>ing that there was no one to whom she </p><p>could go. “My boy wants to tell the world </p><p>I am his mother,” she said, after I had let </p><p>her know the vicissitudes of the ill-fated </p><p>letter, “but it can’t be.” She said s,t with </p><p>an intonation of finality. There was some- </p><p>thing more than a woman’s sacrificial stub- </p><p>bornness in her voice. </p><p> “He doesn’t know—even yet—'all. And</p><p>I can’t tell him, ever!” she said. </p><p> I did not understand that remark. She</p><p>did not appear to expect me to understand. </p><p>I made no comment. </p><p> To make one sentence of it: Thrope, she</p><p>said, was an enemy from of old; she had </p><p>I </p><p>34 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>known him for many, many years, and for </p><p>most of them had been afraid of him. </p><p> “I am terribly afraid of him,” she re-</p><p>peated, looking at me in such a way that I </p><p>could not very well help saying— </p><p> “Any time, just send word to me through</p><p>Delaney of the Hoop-la Saloon.” </p><p> She told me more than it is necessary to</p><p>repeat of how she had watched over the boy, </p><p>keeping her secret from every one but him. </p><p>On his twelfth birthday she had ventured </p><p>to tell him the truth. </p><p> “Or as much of it as my shame would let</p><p>me. I said his father was dead and—” she </p><p>broke off chokingly. </p><p> When I had tirst returned the letter to her</p><p>she had learned that Thrope was after it </p><p>and she determined to destroy it. But she </p><p>could not. It meant too much. Mr. Ellis, </p><p>who had been sent to San Francisco as soon </p><p>as Bryan had learned of the letter being </p><p>lost, and who, guided by gossip along the </p><p>Barbary Coast, had searched me out, then </p><p>discovered from Mrs. Curwen that it had </p><p>already been returned; and he had returned </p><p>to me and generously paid the money he </p><p>had been given to offer as a reward. </p><p> Mrs. Curwen, afraid of Thrope, had given</p><p>up the house and moved into an apartment. </p><p>That was why I could not locate her. At </p><p>last, determined to ease her mind for once </p><p>and all, she had decided to burn the letter. </p><p>Then she had found that it was gone and a </p><p>blank piece of paper had been substituted. </p><p>As she had read and reread it frequently, </p><p>she knew the substitution had been but re- </p><p>cently made. </p><p> She never suspected Helen, but was thor-</p><p>oughly frightened. She did not know that </p><p>Helen and Thrope had even met. Mrs. </p><p>Curwen had spent a terrible week—which </p><p>had its anguish greatly increased by the dis- </p><p>appearance of Helen. </p><p> All of her life, fear and tragedy had</p><p>stalked beside her; and now she was tensely </p><p>wrought up. The capacity for passive suf- </p><p>fering had been exhausted.</p><p> “Thrope will try to use that letter against</p><p>my boy,” she cried, “and if he does— Oh, </p><p>if he does-” </p><p> She broke off.</p><p> For a moment the tigress that is in every</p><p>woman appeared. Her hands became claws </p><p>and her face changed to a harpy’s. Stir </p><p>any woman—any man—to the ultimate </p><p>depths of desperation, and there will appear </p><p>the claws and gleaming teeth. </p><p> Anthropologists estimate that we were</p><p>beasts of the clawing hands and teeth about </p><p>four times as long as we of the so-called </p><p>human race have been men and women. A </p><p>moment of ferocious tenseness—and she </p><p>was exhausted and fell back weakly into </p><p>her chair. She muttered rather than said— </p><p> “Oh, if the people only knew—but I can’t</p><p>tell—I won’t tell! I would die first!” </p><p> She said nothing more and I did not ques-</p><p>tion her, but I was more moved than I shall </p><p>try to express. </p><p> I haven’t repeated and do not intend to</p><p>repeat what she told me of how she suffered </p><p>and worked and planned to help that boy, </p><p>now the line congressman; of how her heart </p><p>would almost leap from her breast at men- </p><p>tion of his name, and of the secret pride she </p><p>felt when people praised him as fearless and </p><p>brilliant; of how she hung in the agony of </p><p>suspense at every election for fear he might </p><p>not win—and now to think his career might </p><p>be crumbled in one cowardly, shameful </p><p>blow against which she could oppose no </p><p>buckler! </p><p> I tried to assure her that her fear was</p><p>largely anxiety; but she assured me that </p><p>there was no infamy to which Thrope would </p><p>not plunge with pleasure; that I had no </p><p>conception of what he would do—that I </p><p>liad no conception of what he could do, and </p><p>she would not tell me, would not tell any </p><p>one! Never! Never! </p><p> I thought that I could understand her</p><p>hysteria, but I was deeply touched by her </p><p>sorrow, by her tragic situation. I again </p><p>offered to do whatever I could at any time. </p><p>IX</p><p>I SHALL say nothing of the political </p><p>campaign, beyond the fact that it was </p><p>unusually hot and bitter; and that </p><p>Bryan spoke night after night and seemed </p><p>to have aroused the State as it had never </p><p>been aroused before against the old gang; </p><p>and the old gang viciously distorted his </p><p>record and attacked him. </p><p> For some weeks my life went on about</p><p>the same as usual. I read the papers and </p><p>played cards and people let me alone. I </p><p>went every time Bryan spoke in San Fran- </p><p>ciso, and I liked him. He was a fighter— </p><p>inspired by something more than the hank- </p><p>ering for a governorship. </p><p> I looked him over carefully and felt that</p><p>there was a man who could not be broken </p><p>Born to be Hanged, But— </p><p>35 </p><p>and would not bend; a man whose word and </p><p>honor could be trusted. And though I </p><p>knew very well that he would keep that </p><p>word and run the gambling-joints out of the </p><p>State—I told whoever took the trouble to </p><p>inquire that I should vote for him. </p><p> “You’re crazy,” said Delaney.</p><p> “I’d rather have him for an enemy than</p><p>Thrope for a friend.” </p><p> “He’ll ruin our business,” said Delaney.</p><p> “Thrope’s ruined our conscience,” I</p><p>said. </p><p> And Delaney blinked once or twice and</p><p>opened his mouth like a fish; and at last </p><p>he said incredulously that he believed I </p><p>meant it! </p><p> “How far would you trust Thrope?” I</p><p>asked. </p><p> “No farther ’an a .45 ’11 carry.”</p><p> “There you are. Bryan keeps his word.</p><p>INe never broken mine. I shall vote for </p><p>him. Australia’s wide open—I’ll go there </p><p>and play cards.” </p><p> The conversation was longer but as tri-</p><p>vial and only confirmed Delaney in the </p><p>opinion that I was crazy. </p><p> It was about ten days before election</p><p>that Delaney gleefully told me my friend </p><p>Bryan was a goner; Thrope had an ace </p><p>up his sleeve and it was going to be pub- </p><p>lished in his paper the next Sunday—“a </p><p>letter of some kind.” </p><p> I was a little jumpy every time “letter”</p><p>was mentioned. </p><p> I wanted to find out definitely; but there</p><p>was no way I knew of that I could. Thrope </p><p>was out of the city—or was supposed to be. </p><p>"Bryan was also out of the city. I found </p><p>other people living in Mrs. Curwen’s house. </p><p>She had sold it. </p><p> They did not know where she was.</p><p>Helen had gone to sea with her husband,</p><p>Captain Whibley—a real honeymoon this </p><p>time. I went to Bryan’s headquarters, but </p><p>there was nobody around there I would </p><p>trust, so I came away. Then I went in </p><p>search of a newspaper man whom I knew </p><p>and rather liked. </p><p> He was an alert young fellow, full of ideas</p><p>and rather flattered by being the friend of </p><p>so notorious a figure as myself; besides he </p><p>had once been fired from—I shall call it the </p><p>Tribune, as it has changed hands since then </p><p>and is now a decent paper—the Tribune, </p><p>Thrope’s paper. </p><p> “Supposing,” I said to him, for I knew</p><p>no more about the workings of a newspaper </p><p>than the average editor does of poker, how- </p><p>ever much editors play at it. “Supposing </p><p>the editor of the Tribune had something I </p><p>wanted. That he intended to put it in the </p><p>paper—a picture, or a letter? How would </p><p>I go about getting it?” </p><p> “Best way’d be to blow up the building,”</p><p>he said. As I did not seem to appreciate the </p><p>joke, he added soberly: </p><p> “A picture—maybe they’ve taken a copy</p><p>and the original is stowed some place. Let- </p><p>ter—anything like that, they photograph </p><p>it. Nobody may know where the original </p><p>is.” </p><p> “How can I get in to the editor?”</p><p> I had heard that editors were as unap-</p><p>proachable as kings and things. </p><p> “Tell ’em you got a story—tell ’em who</p><p>you are, and that you’ve got a story you </p><p>won’t turn loose to nobody but Old Man </p><p>Blake himself.” </p><p> I did. At eleven-thirty Friday night I</p><p>was shown into the anteroom of Mr. </p><p>Blake’s private office and told to wait. I </p><p>was left alone. I noticed that the ante- </p><p>room door locked from the inside, though </p><p>the lock did not appear ever to have been </p><p>used. </p><p> I listened at the door marked Private.</p><p> Blake was not alone.</p><p> I gently tried the door. It was unlocked.</p><p>I crossed the room and locked the ante-</p><p>room door, then stepped through the one </p><p>marked Private, saying as I came in— </p><p>“Just the very man I wanted to see, Mr. </p><p>Thrope!” </p><p> Thxope started to roar, but perceived</p><p>that it was I, and his glance apprehensively </p><p>searched out my hands. He seemed to </p><p>think that I went around ready to shoot. </p><p> Blake was a fat man, bald-headed, with</p><p>protruding side-whiskers;andhe drew in his </p><p>breath with toad-like pomposity to order </p><p>me out of the room, but he looked at </p><p>Thrope and asked— </p><p> “Do you know him?”</p><p> “You do, too,” said Thrope. “It’s-”</p><p>he mentioned my name with a peculiar </p><p>falling inflection, muttering it as though </p><p>unwilling to speak it aloud. </p><p> I suppose that it was unpleasant on his</p><p>tongue. </p><p> “Well, what’d you want?” said Thrope,</p><p>trying not to be more unpleasant than he </p><p>could help, for he knew by this time by </p><p>something more than hearsay that I would </p><p>—well, he remembered Smith, Swanson and </p><p>36 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> certain other men on board the Jessie Dar-*</p><p> ling. And though he wished me well out of</p><p> his sight he did not make that wish too ap-</p><p> parent.</p><p> “Bryan’s letter,” I told him briefly.</p><p> “Trapped, by-!” said Blake apoplec-</p><p> tically, and his hand reached toward a but-</p><p> ton at the end of his desk.</p><p> “Supposing you put yoUr hands in</p><p> your pockets, Mr. Blake!” I told him</p><p> pointedly.</p><p> His puffed eyes bulged a little; but he</p><p> followed my suggestion, ramming his hands</p><p> into his pockcts as if defying me instead</p><p> of complying with my gentle request.</p><p> “She sent vou here!” Thrope accused.</p><p> “-her!”</p><p> “Naturally,” I said. “Why else do you</p><p> suppose I happened to come—at this psy-</p><p> chological moment?” I asked, not knowing</p><p> what it was all about.</p><p> But I never hesitate to take any advan-</p><p> tage that Fortune hands to me, and I</p><p> have found Fortune a most generous</p><p> mistress.</p><p> “The letter isn't here,” said Blake, ad-</p><p> vancing some information in a manner</p><p> that impressed me as too considerate.</p><p> “No?” I asked.</p><p> “No!” said Thrope.</p><p> “No!” echoed Blake emphatically.</p><p> “Then why do you lie to each other?” I</p><p> demanded, stressing the words just as much</p><p> as I thought was needed to make them un-</p><p> comfortable.</p><p> Both men gave a slight start. I doubt if</p><p> they did realize what I meant, but they did</p><p> not feel comfortable.</p><p> “I had my ear to the keyhole there for</p><p> some moments—before I came in. The</p><p> letter is in that safe, or you are a liar!” I</p><p> addressed the last to Blake.</p><p> He started to bound up, with something</p><p> like—</p><p> “No man can call me that!”</p><p> But he sat down and finished his sen-</p><p> tence in an inarticulate mumble.</p><p> I had made no move, no gesture. But he</p><p> understood.</p><p>“You talk too-much!” Thrope ex- </p><p>claimed accusingly at the editor. </p><p> Since I had heard Thrope ask him if the</p><p> letter was in the safe, and Blake had only</p><p> answered, I felt the accusation a little un-</p><p> just; but I made no comment.</p><p> “I don’t suppose she’ll telephone now,”</p><p> said Thrope, looking at me inquiringly.</p><p> “Oh, my presence here will make no differ-</p><p>ence. She will telephone, I suppose.” I as- </p><p>sured him. </p><p> “It’s time then,” said Blake staring up at</p><p>the clock. </p><p> “But the letter—first. Now,” I said.</p><p>THEN I learned something of what </p><p>it was all about. Mrs. Curwen was </p><p>trying to get Thrope to give up the </p><p>letter. He would not meet her, but he had </p><p>made a telephone appointment. She had </p><p>assured him that she could give reasons why </p><p>he should return the letter to her, why he </p><p>would be glad to return it. </p><p> Thrope was naturally incredulous. It</p><p>seemed that he and Mrs. Curwen had known </p><p>each other for many many years; and </p><p>Thrope—though he did not say this—ap- </p><p>peared to have taken a sort of pleasure all </p><p>those years in keeping her afraid of him. </p><p>He knew that she was afraid of him, and he </p><p>had enjoyed the bullying pleasure of keep- </p><p>ing her frightened. </p><p> By chance I had stepped into the game</p><p>and demanded cards at the crucial moment. </p><p>Let me pause a minute to remark that no- </p><p>body will be likely to convince me that I </p><p>am religious; and yet anybody will have a</p><p>hard lime convincing me that there is not </p><p>something—something sentient in Destiny </p><p>that rules with an inexorable hand this </p><p>thing we carelessly call “chance” and </p><p>“luck.” </p><p> In my own life—and I believe other men</p><p>can look into their own lives and find the </p><p>same—it has happened too often that by so- </p><p>called chance I have made such entrances, </p><p>and by chance played such part in the lives </p><p>of men and women, as if my r61e were di- </p><p>rected by a great and watchful dramatist. </p><p> This thing we call ‘‘luck” and “chance”</p><p>is too pertinent, too advertent, too much the </p><p>fabric of design, to be merely accidental. </p><p>I know many lips will trace skeptical smiles </p><p>upon themselves at such a statement; but </p><p>let the more thoughtful reflect that every </p><p>situation begins and develops from some- </p><p>thing—some meeting, word, introduction, </p><p>from something, that can properly be called </p><p>chance. </p><p> This is so true that it can not be denied</p><p>once any one recognizes the viewpoint from </p><p>which I make the statement. And I never, </p><p>before or since, felt myself so much the </p><p>pawn of some inscrutable chance as in the </p><p>affair of Thrope and Mrs. Curwen. </p><p>Bom to be Hanged, But— </p><p>37 </p><p> i’he whole tiling moved to its inexorable</p><p>end, its inexorable and tragic end, too </p><p>inevitably to have been mere happen- </p><p>chance. But, of course, I am telling a story </p><p>—not offering a contribution to meta- </p><p>physics. </p><p> Mrs. Curwen telephoned.</p><p> Naturally, with all the honesty of her</p><p>nature, she denied that I had had anything </p><p>to do with the plan to get in touch with </p><p>Thrope; she denied that I had found from </p><p>her where he could be located at that hour. </p><p> And I fancy that she was surprized at the</p><p>sudden change in Thrope’s manner over </p><p>the telephone; for when he had said some </p><p>fifty words in his characteristic manner— </p><p>or at least the manner that he seemed to </p><p>employ toward women whom he did not </p><p>care to flatter—he abruptly became polite </p><p>and almost gracious. The suggestion that </p><p>he do so, of course, came from me, and </p><p>came in such a way that he did not care </p><p>to refuse. </p><p> I could make nothing of the conversa-</p><p>tion over the phone because I heard very </p><p>little of it after Thrope quieted down. Mrs. </p><p>Curwen seemed to be doing all of the talk- </p><p>ing; and it seemed to me that Thrope was </p><p>strangely impressed and by something </p><p>more than I had said. </p><p> I noticed him biting his knuckles as</p><p>if to restrain his emotion. But, I re- </p><p>flected, that might have been from sup- </p><p>pressed anger. But his whole manner dis- </p><p>closed a nervousness that was remarkable. </p><p>He glanced almost furtively from me to </p><p>Blake as though fearful that we, too, were </p><p>hearing. </p><p> The conversation lasted for some min-</p><p>utes. It ended with Thrope agreeing to </p><p>make an appointment to meet her alone in </p><p>his own office the following night. </p><p> I found out afterward—from her—that</p><p>she had summoned one of the specters that </p><p>haunted her past and set it on to Thrope. </p><p>Mrs. Curwen in her younger days had </p><p>been reckless, rash, even more so than </p><p>Helen. She too had loved Thrope. He had</p><p>murdered a man before her eyes. She had </p><p>had no part in the crime but the love she </p><p>then bore him, which constrained her to </p><p>secrecy. </p><p> Always she had been afraid that the story</p><p>would come out, and that Thrope would— </p><p>as he threatened—make it appear that she </p><p>had killed the man herself. At last, des- </p><p>perate, she had reversed the situation and </p><p>declared that whatever the shame might be </p><p>to her, she was going to force the story out </p><p>and blast him, though it blasted her too! </p><p>As a coward always is when the victim </p><p>turns, Thrope was frightened. </p><p> But by the following night Thrope had</p><p>summoned his ingenuity. He had made de- </p><p>ductions and arrived at what seemed satis- </p><p>factory conclusions for bullying the woman </p><p>further: let her force the story out into the </p><p>public. He ended by hoping she would do </p><p>it, for he—he could make political capital </p><p>of it. Besides, what is money for if not to </p><p>prove alibis, even in a murder of twenty </p><p>years ago! </p><p> I am getting a little ahead of my narra-</p><p>tive. The letter was yet to be disposed of. </p><p>That, however, did not take long. </p><p> When the telephone conversation was</p><p>over I merely repeated that I wanted it, </p><p>and at once; and Blake unlocked the little </p><p>office safe and gave it to me. Then I struck </p><p>a match and burned it and ground the </p><p>ashes into the carpet with my heel. </p><p> I faced them and said:</p><p> “Something unpleasant will happen to</p><p>somebody if the attempt is made to arrest </p><p>me on the charge of robbing a girl, or fleec- </p><p>ing a miner, or violating the ordinance </p><p>about obstructing the traffic, or on any other </p><p>of the trumped-up charges which you fel- </p><p>lows usually make to get a man into jail. </p><p>Think up something original, very original, </p><p>if you want me to pay attention to it—then </p><p>send a detective you don’t care much about </p><p>to serve it!” </p><p> I was young, and of course talked a little</p><p>more than I would under similar circum- </p><p>stances now. About the last thing that a </p><p>young man learns is that no words, or at </p><p>most two or three, will usually be more im-</p><p>pressive than a speech—such as play- </p><p>wrights like to give heroes. </p><p> But what I did say was brief enough to</p><p>carry weight with Thrope and Blake— </p><p>largely because they knew that Spike De- </p><p>laney had, so to speak, put his sheltering </p><p>wing over me and would, as the phrase goes, </p><p>“start something” if another frame-up was </p><p>pulled on me. </p><p>X </p><p>THIS ends my story. I will get to </p><p>the concluding facts briefly. </p><p>The following morning, through De- </p><p>laney, Mrs. Curwen anxiously sent word for </p><p>me to meet her. </p><p>38 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> It was to be a busy day for Thrope and</p><p>he did not know how much, if at all, before </p><p>midnight he could get to the office and keep </p><p>his appointment with her. Mrs. Curwen </p><p>was exceedingly nervous, but she said that </p><p>she was not afraid. However, she wanted </p><p>me to conceal myself in the office as a wit- </p><p>ness of what passed between them. </p><p> “I am afraid,” she said tremulously, “I</p><p>shall have to tell him something that no one </p><p>on eartli knows but myself—and—and I </p><p>want you to know. I trust you—after what </p><p>you did about that letter, and for Helen. </p><p>And after what Mr. Ellis says.” </p><p> Ellis, Edwin Ellis, I found—he was the</p><p>man who had come to me offering ten </p><p>thousand for the recovery of the letter and </p><p>had later forced payment of that sum upon </p><p>me—was a detective from Washington who </p><p>had been hurried to San Francisco as soon </p><p>as Mrs. Curwen had reported the loss of the </p><p>letter. The first time we met he had </p><p>learned that 1 had it, but not that I had </p><p>returned it. As soon as he discovered that </p><p>I had returned the letter he generously </p><p>gave me the reward that Bryan had been </p><p>willing to pay. </p><p> The elevator ran until ten o’clock on</p><p>Saturday nights in the Thrope Building. </p><p>Mrs. Curwen went up at ten, and I followed </p><p>a minute later. She suggested that it </p><p>might be best for us not to be seen together. </p><p> She opened the door direct from the hall</p><p>into Thrope’s private office and left it un- </p><p>locked for me—or rather held it ajar for </p><p>me, and held her finger warningly to her lip. </p><p> “Somebody’s in there—I heard them</p><p>move!” she whispered soundlessly, indi- </p><p>cating a door that opened from the private </p><p>office into another room. </p><p> Nobody could very well have proper</p><p>business in there, since no light was burn- </p><p>ing—or at least none showed under the door. </p><p> I tiptoed across and listened, but I heard</p><p>nothing. </p><p> Perhaps Mrs. Curwen had been mistaken,</p><p>but the chances always were that Thrope</p><p>could not be trusted; and he might have </p><p>somebody there—and that somebody’s </p><p>presence might be for any purpose. </p><p> I looked at Mrs. Curwen. She wore a</p><p>long coat and a bonnet hat. The thick </p><p>veil that had covered her face was lifted so </p><p>I could see how brightly her eyes were burn- </p><p>ing, eyes that seemed much sunken since </p><p>we last met; and how tightly thin her Ups </p><p>were pressed. She looked more like a figure </p><p>of stately allegory than a woman come to </p><p>plead with a man, for she stood erect and </p><p>the long lines of the coat that fell below her </p><p>knees gave her form a certain dignity such </p><p>as one seldom sees. </p><p> She would not flinch. I could teU that</p><p>much. </p><p> I spoke to her with lip movement rather</p><p>than with sound—noiselessly. I told her </p><p>to pretend to telephone that she would not </p><p>wait, and was leaving; then to step into the </p><p>hall and shut the door after her. </p><p> She did so.</p><p> I stood beside the door opening into the</p><p>next room and waited. For some seconds </p><p>aU was quiet, then I detected the shuffling </p><p>of feet. Silence again. The party on the </p><p>other side was listening. </p><p> The lock turned in the door. It moved</p><p>cautiously, then sbwly opened so that a </p><p>little furtive middle-aged man blinked in </p><p>the light. He was near-sighted and wore </p><p>heavy glasses; and, too, he had come from </p><p>a dark room into a lighted one. </p><p> Mine is not a gentle hand. My fingers</p><p>fastened on the back of his neck. The other </p><p>hand went over his mouth and silenced the </p><p>cry that he started to make. He was a </p><p>weak little office-bred clerk, frightened and </p><p>not even cunning. Bv occupation he was </p><p>court reporter, very good at shorthand he </p><p>said. </p><p> Some woman was coming to blackmail</p><p>Mr. Thrope and he had been posted there </p><p>to take a stenographic record, he said; and </p><p>at once admitted that he had lied. He </p><p>tried another evasion or two. then admitted </p><p>that he was Thrope's stenographer. He</p><p>had been with Thrope for years. He knew </p><p>that a woman was coming to meet Thrope </p><p>and he had been posted to take it down. </p><p> A little listening-hole had been made in</p><p>the wall. I might almost say that it had </p><p>been built in. He showed it to me and ad- </p><p>mitted that it had been used on many oc- </p><p>casions. A small electric light, partly boxed </p><p>in, illuminated a small shelf upon which </p><p>he could rest his pad and make his notes </p><p>with ease. </p><p> I took a towel, fashioned a gag, and</p><p>locked Mr. Stenographer in the lavatory. </p><p>I took his keys from him and investigated </p><p>the various doors. I thought it might be </p><p>well for me to have some way out in case I </p><p>wanted to leave without interrupting the </p><p>interview between Thrope and Mrs. Cur- </p><p>wen. Thrope’s offices—he was at the head </p><p>Bom to be Hanged, But— </p><p>39 </p><p>of a big lumber company—occupied very </p><p>nearly half of the space on one side of the </p><p>building; and I found that I could open a </p><p>door far down the corridor and near the </p><p>stairs—almost a third of a block away </p><p>from Thrope’s private office. </p><p> Mrs. Curwen and I said a few words, but</p><p>she was in no mood to talk; so, not knowing </p><p>what minute Thrope might come, I went </p><p>inside to the peep-hole and waited. I could </p><p>watch her, and did. She sat very quiet, </p><p>motionless, except that her breathing was </p><p>deep and hurried as if she were making a </p><p>severe effort to control herself. </p><p>THROPE came, big, hearty and </p><p>sure of himself. </p><p> “Well, Mary,” he said with kind</p><p>of sardonic amusement, “we meet again.” </p><p> “Yes, again.”</p><p> “So you’re going to try to rake up the</p><p>past, eh? You know what ’11 happen. I </p><p>was a fool to ever try to protect you for that </p><p>murder, Mary. But then, you see, I didn’t </p><p>really know you killed him and I loved </p><p>you!” </p><p> Mrs. Curwen was amazed. She did not</p><p>realize that Thrope was talking for the </p><p>benefit of the stenographic report—that </p><p>was not being taken. </p><p> “And so this Bryan is your brat, eh?</p><p>And you want him elected. Trying to </p><p>bluff me out of the running. I am too weak </p><p>with women—they twist me around their </p><p>fingers. You know. You used to do it. </p><p>But you can’t bully me! No. What do you </p><p>want?” </p><p> She told him, speaking in a low, strained</p><p>voice, that she wanted him to withdraw </p><p>from the campaign, that she wanted him to </p><p>give up the fight against Bryan. </p><p> “You will regret it—oh, how you will</p><p>regret it, if you don’t!” </p><p> It was more of a prophecy than a</p><p>threat. She was not angry. She was </p><p>pleading.</p><p> “He is your-!” Thrope used the ugly</p><p>word generally applied to the children of </p><p>unfortunate mothers. </p><p> “And yours!” she cried.</p><p> I doubt if she had intended to say as</p><p>much, to tell him that at all; but the retort </p><p>was irresistibly drawn from her. </p><p> They stared at each other, and stared</p><p>and stared, and made no move. </p><p> “Is that true?” he asked in a low, almost</p><p>inaudible voice. </p><p>_“Yes!” And quickly, pleadingly she </p><p>sketched the history of how she had helped </p><p>and guarded the boy, and never told him </p><p>who his father was, and made him feel that </p><p>it was better that he should not let the world </p><p>know who his mother was, because she </p><p>wanted him to rise—to go up and on, and </p><p>be honest, to be noble. </p><p> “And he couldn’t do it,” she hissed, “if</p><p>he knew such blood as yours was in his </p><p>veins.” </p><p> Thrope believed her. He knew she spoke</p><p>the truth. But he was a politician, and </p><p>there was less manhood in him than there </p><p>is in the jackal, which will fight for its own. </p><p> “You lie, woman. You lie! You can’t</p><p>prove that I-” </p><p> “No,” she cut in, “because I had a good</p><p>father and mother. And met you secretly </p><p>because they disliked you. I can prove </p><p>nothing! I do not need proof. You know </p><p>it. Oh, give up this campaign—let him win. </p><p>Don’t drag up my shame to light. I don’t </p><p>care. But it is for him. For my boy— </p><p>your son! That letter—that horrible un- </p><p>lucky letter! How proud 1 was when he </p><p>sent it to me. You might have made the </p><p>letter public because you will do anything </p><p>to get your end. But now—now you must </p><p>not fight him! I didn’t intend to tell you. </p><p>It was my secret, *nine and God’s!” </p><p> “Leave God out of it, when you lie! You</p><p>can’t bluff me like that. He’s yours- </p><p>and you’re trying to drag me into it! This </p><p>is the craftiest political deal I’ve erer run </p><p>up against. I suppose he put you up to </p><p>come! Now look here, old girl, I’ll show you </p><p>what happens when anybody tries to put </p><p>something over on me! Every word of this </p><p>interview goes in the paper tomorrow morn- </p><p>ing—in the Tribune! There’s a stenog- </p><p>rapher in there has taken down every word. </p><p>I’m not afraid. Let the public judge be- </p><p>tween us. My son,-! Your-1” </p><p> The fold of Mrs. Curwen’s cloak was</p><p>pushed aside. A large ivory handled, nickel- </p><p>plated revolver came into view, and as it </p><p>came into view, she shot. </p><p> Thrope fell dead. A bullet in his brain.</p><p>[gpjnB WHEN people came a-pounding at </p><p>figzfl! the door and ilung it open, for it </p><p>Ittml was not locked, I turned hastily </p><p>back from that door that led inside and, </p><p>without seeming to have a purpose in doing </p><p>so, barred the way. So Mrs. Curwen es7 </p><p>caped alone. I had taken the gun from her </p><p>40 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>hand as she stood motionless, looking down </p><p>upon the man whom she had at last paid </p><p>with the full measure of vengenace. </p><p> The shot that killed Thrope seemed, too,</p><p>to have numbed her realization of what she </p><p>had done. It was not until 1 took the gun </p><p>from her hand and pushed her inside the </p><p>room from which 1 had just come that she </p><p>seemed to understand that there was a </p><p>chance to escape. She had not appeared to </p><p>think of trying to, or of caring to escape. I </p><p>am inclined to believe that she had come </p><p>determined to kill him anyway. Certainly </p><p>she knew that she had nothing to fear from </p><p>the stenographic report of the conversation </p><p>upon which Thrope had depended. </p><p> It was not gallantry or. even forethought</p><p>on my part that caused me to turn and take </p><p>the blame. I did it instinctively. But, </p><p>having done so, I could not refuse to carry </p><p>the role out. I would make no statement </p><p>to any one. The evidence was incontrover- </p><p>tible. I could not escape conviction. </p><p> Let me review the situation briefly. If</p><p>Mrs. Curwen kept silent I could not escape </p><p>hanging. If she confided with Bryan and </p><p>he, as the governor, declined to injure his </p><p>career by pardoning me, I could not escape. </p><p>True, I could have stirred up a sensation, </p><p>but I could have proved nothing. Blake of </p><p>the Tribune offered to use his influence— </p><p>preposterous! he had none and I told him </p><p>so—in getting me a pardon if I would tell </p><p>the truth. </p><p> He suspected that Mrs. Curwen was im-</p><p>plicated. He also thought of using the copy </p><p>and photograph of one page of the letter, </p><p>but was afraid to go through with it. But </p><p>Bryan, who was readily elected, was in </p><p>almost as bad a iix as I: if he pardoned me, </p><p>people would say that he had connived </p><p>with me to put his personal and political </p><p>enemy out of the way; if he did not pardon </p><p>me—well, he had his own conscience to live </p><p>with. </p><p> The truth could not come out unless his</p><p>own mother was thrown into the prisoner’s </p><p>dock and the hideous and sordid story ex- </p><p>hausted to its last detail. </p><p> Any way out somebody’s life would be</p><p>ruined—some innocent person’s life, for I </p><p>refuse to consider Mrs. Curwen guilty, </p><p>though I think she had been touched by </p><p>madness. A jury might have acquitted her, </p><p>but Thrope’s friends would have been pow- </p><p>erful; besides, her son’s career would have </p><p> been ruined—and that was more to her</p><p>than life. </p><p> I felt sorry for her, and for the young</p><p>governor; but not sorry enough to be </p><p>hanged, though I showed some patience in </p><p>the trial and conviction. </p><p> In fact, I had to be convicted before the</p><p>governor could help me! I was convicted </p><p>and was sentenced by a judge of Thrope’s </p><p>own choosing to be hanged. </p><p> That judge put much feeling into the</p><p>reading of the death sentence. He had </p><p>shown all through the trial plenty of grati- </p><p>tude to the memory of the man who had </p><p>raised him on stuffed ballots to the </p><p>bench. </p><p> I have never had much use for circum-</p><p>stantial evidence or belief in capital punish- </p><p>ment since those trying days. </p><p> What happened? In some mysterious</p><p>manner I got hold of a revolver and held up </p><p>the turnkey one morning between mid- </p><p>night and dawn. My good friend Delaney </p><p>had paid that turnkey the sum of ten thou- </p><p>sand dollars to give me this revolver and to </p><p>be held up; and of course Delaney had no </p><p>objections to paying out such a large sum </p><p>because it was the ten thousand dollars that </p><p>Bryan, through Ellis, had given me as a re- </p><p>ward for returning that letter—of malignant </p><p>influence. </p><p> By an odd coincidence that nobody</p><p>seemed to remark, I escaped on the night </p><p>before Captain Whibley—who had left the </p><p>Thrope Lumber Company’s service—sailed </p><p>on a windjammer for Sydney. </p><p> But four people knew: Delaney, Sam</p><p>Tyler, who met me at the wharf and took </p><p>me to Whibley’s ship, and Whibley and </p><p>Helen. Mrs. Curwen had told her. So the </p><p>bread I had cast upon the water came back </p><p>to me, and the governor had not connived </p><p>at my escape, nor was he embarrassed by</p><p>having to pardon me. I believe that he </p><p>would have done so—still, it is a terrible </p><p>thing to make a politician, even an honest </p><p>one, choose between his conscience and his </p><p>career. </p><p>SICKNESS, death, cut Governor </p><p>Bryan off as he was finishing his </p><p>second term. Shortly afterward </p><p>Mrs. Curwen died. With the death of her </p><p>son she had nothing more to live for. The </p><p>confession that cleared my name was found </p><p>under her pillow. </p><p>Author of “The Spirit oj His Youth," “Too Much Caulion,"clc. </p><p>TtREE large, evil men lolled in </p><p>sultry shade of “Spade” Gowdy’s </p><p>Nugget Saloon, watching one </p><p>*** small, righteous man at work in </p><p>the sun. It was far too hot to work, but </p><p>Obadiah Higgins toiled painstakingly with </p><p>the resiny pine planking of the curb over </p><p>the newly dug saloon well. The three </p><p>onlookers had struck a bargain with Oba- </p><p>diah and were only awaiting the completion </p><p>of the task to enjoy seeing Obadiah take </p><p>his strange payment. </p><p> The wait was not irksome, for Obadiah</p><p>was a deft workman; besides, he had been </p><p>working on that well-curb since early morn- </p><p>ing, and it was now nearly noon. Obadiah </p><p>drove the last nail as carefully and surely </p><p>as he had the first. Skillfully he planed </p><p>down imperceptible rough spots; carefully </p><p>he hung the new pulley-wheel in the exact </p><p>center of the frame. In fact, it was a </p><p>wcll-curb fit to grace any well in the little </p><p>Eastern hamlet that had been his home </p><p>town, instead of being set over a saloon </p><p>well, a mere unpain ted pine necessity in a </p><p>squalid little gulch town like El Oro. </p><p> Obadiah paused a moment to inspect his</p><p>handiwork. Obadiah was scrawny. Yes, </p><p>Obadiah Higgins was scrawny. He couldn’t </p><p>have tipped the scales over one hundred </p><p>and twenty at his prime—if he ever had </p><p>any prime—and now he was well past his </p><p>prime—fifty at least, gray, with a smoothly </p><p>shaven face pleasantly furrowed. Cheery </p><p>little wrinkles played about the comers of </p><p>his eyes and humorous, up-turned ones </p><p>were etched where his lips met in their </p><p>not too firm line in front of his toothless </p><p>gums. His nose was thin, too, like the </p><p>rest of him, and ended in a little hook. </p><p>His eyes—his wistful gray eyes that had </p><p>always trusted everybody and just couldn’t </p><p>get over their puppylike faith in the good- </p><p>ness of everything—looked out hungrily on </p><p>a world they seemed never to understand. - </p><p>Obadiah had been cheated. He—he was </p><p>—well, possibly there was something lack- </p><p>ing. Forty years he had endured the rail- </p><p>lery of thoughtless citizens of the little home </p><p>town - back East—forty years of satirical </p><p>gibes that alone would have been enough </p><p>to shift the balance of a stronger mind than </p><p>his. Finally one of the younger generation </p><p>openly called him a —— fool. Obadiah,</p><p>with a childlike faith that he could go </p><p>“out West” and make good, summoned all </p><p>his courage and bid the town good-by. </p><p> Ten years Obadiah pitted his frail</p><p>strength against the stem odds of the </p><p>gold country. Finally he drifted to El </p><p>Oro. He could have been a skilled worker </p><p>in fine woods elsewhere, but in El Oro he </p><p>was a carpenter. While it was pitifully </p><p>apparent he had been a failure all along, </p><p>he still harbored eternal hope that he could, </p><p>before the end, go back home and show </p><p>them that he had “madegood.” </p><p>[250EVIDENTLY Obadiah decided the </p><p>job was satisfactorily done, for he </p><p>SSfflgRput away his tools and proceeded </p><p>to reap his reward. Taking from his tool- </p><p>kit a tomato can half filled with a black </p><p>fluid composed of lampblack and a dash </p><p>of the camp’s meager supply of kerosene, </p><p>Obadiah knelt stifly before the curb and </p><p>stirred expectantly with the caked brush </p><p>that was mostly handle. Then, with infinite </p><p>4i </p><p>42 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>care, he printed on the glaring hot planks </p><p>a big, boyish looking G. Repeating the </p><p>process, he turned out an O, then a D. </p><p> “G-o-d—good,” stated “Spade” Gowdy</p><p>to his two companions in the shade. </p><p> “Good nothin’,” corrected Jim Moore</p><p>scornfully; “can’t you read, Spade? That </p><p>word ain’t ‘good’—hit’s ‘Gawd!’” </p><p> “Ho, him, eh? You mean our ol’ Uncle</p><p>Billy in heaven we ain’t never seen and </p><p>won’t till we croak an’ he tells us to go </p><p>to-? Him?” </p><p> “Boys!” Obadiah twisted around, bal-</p><p>ancing with a hand to the curb, and ad- </p><p>dressed the three. “Oh, I wish you </p><p>wouldn’t talk that way. It’s—it’s wicked, </p><p>boys. Besides, it’s not giving the Creator </p><p>a square deal. I just wish you’d wait a </p><p>minute till I get this printed. It’ll be </p><p>something real nice, boys.” </p><p> “Well, turn around an’ git a move on,</p><p>thin,” suggested Danny Carver. “Go ahead </p><p>wid yer printin’, and mind ye now, git off </p><p>a new one. I’m fed up wid readin’ the </p><p>old ones on ivry rock an’ plank in the coun- </p><p>thry. Go on, print us a new one.” </p><p> “Naw,” objected Spade Gowdy. “Let</p><p>him quit right there. He’s got ’nough. </p><p>That one word tells the tale. Leave her </p><p>stand as it is.” </p><p> “Just put ‘ain’t hit hot’ after that there</p><p>word,” broke in Moore. “That’ll be a </p><p>reg’lar he-platitude. Gord, ain’t hit hot! </p><p>I’m like Carver, I’m getting tired of ‘Re- </p><p>pent,’ ‘Seek ye the Lord,’ and so forth, </p><p>staring me in the face from every stone in </p><p>Oro gulch. Give us a lively one, ‘Parson.’ ” </p><p>“Nope,” Spade Gowdy insisted stub- </p><p>bornly, “it’s my well-curb and it’s my say </p><p>what goeth thereupon. I say-” </p><p> “You’re wrong there, Spade,” argued</p><p>Moore. “You agreed to let Obadiah print </p><p>any dad-gum thing on it he wanted to, </p><p>long’s he’d build it for you. Leave it to </p><p>him, but for gosh sake let him pull off a</p><p>new one.” </p><p> With much stirring and many gyrations</p><p>of his tongue against his cheek, Obadiah </p><p>had placidly gone ahead, unmindful of the </p><p>argument, and evolved the righteous sen- </p><p>tence : </p><p>God is not Mocked. </p><p> “ ‘Gawd is not m-o-c-k-e-d.’ Mock-ed.</p><p>Moc-ke-d.” Spade Gowdy struggled with </p><p>the letters. “Neck-ed—hah, neckkid! 01’ </p><p>parson out there says Uncle Billy Gawd </p><p>ain’t neckkid. How’s he know? Heh, ‘Par- </p><p>son,’ how’d you know He 'ain’t neckkid? </p><p>Tell us that!” </p><p> Obadiah arose.</p><p> “Boys, I don’t want to force the Word</p><p>on you too much, but hark ye!” Obadiah’s </p><p>meek tones suddenly became clarion clear </p><p>as he quoted: “ ‘Unto him that blas- </p><p>phemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall </p><p>not be forgiven.’ Luke twelve, ten.” </p><p> Stepping humbly to another side of the</p><p>curb, he knelt, stirred and printed. </p><p> “Wow,” mocked Spade, “ol’ ’Postle</p><p>Paul sure turned on the gas that time. </p><p>Won’t be forgiven, eh? What’s the idee </p><p>to beller so about that?” </p><p> “Say, Spade,” Carver began earnestly,</p><p>“faith I do wish ye’d a leetle more eddica- </p><p>cation; then ye wouldn’t be foriver danglin’ </p><p>the sword of Damocles over us this way. </p><p>If ye don’t belave there’s a Creator, keep </p><p>shut about it like I do.” </p><p> “Well, we-1-1!” gasped Spade in feigned</p><p>astonishment. “Why, hello, St. Peter. </p><p>When’d you quit tendin’ bar in the Nug- </p><p>get Saloon and begin distributin’ tracts. </p><p>Say, you red-headed Irishman, if you want </p><p>to begin preachin’, get a paint-pot an’ go </p><p>to it—but come first inside an’ paint a sign </p><p>‘Bartender Wanted’ and let me pay you </p><p>off.” </p><p> Carver only swore.</p><p> Presently, craning, the three shifted their</p><p>positions in the shade to see what Obadiah </p><p>had produced.</p><p>Whatsoever a man soweth, </p><p> Moore read the words quizzically.</p><p> “ ‘Whatsoever a man seweth?” repeated</p><p>Spade wonderingly. </p><p> They waited in silence until Obadiah had</p><p>finished the third side before they ven- </p><p>tured out into the dazzling Arizona sun to </p><p>view the result. </p><p>That shall he also reap. </p><p> Spade stared at Moore in blank unbe-</p><p>lief. He started to speak but caught his </p><p>word half uttered and doubled in raucous </p><p>laughter. </p><p> “Neckkid,” he gasped, “seweth—shall al-</p><p>so rip. Haw, parson, you gotteth off a new </p><p>one on me. Come inside an’ have a drink </p><p>on the house.” </p><p> Obadiah waved his brush in lieu of reply.</p><p>On the fourth side he was laboriously print- </p><p>ing his final shot. </p><p>Three Wise Men </p><p>43 </p><p>Strong Drink is Raging. Whosoever is deceived </p><p>thereby is Not Wise. </p><p> Obadiah, feeling well paid for his morn-</p><p>ing’s labor, hummed as he neatly repacked </p><p>his kit. </p><p> “ ‘Strong drink is r-a-g-i-n-g.’ ” Spade</p><p>was endeavoring to lind out what Obadiah </p><p>had said about strong drink on his well- </p><p>curb. Eventually he decided the word </p><p>was “rag-ging.” He announced: “Strong </p><p>drink is ragging. What the-” </p><p> “You bet it is,” Moore affirmed. “That</p><p>hooch you and Carver peddle in your </p><p>honkeytonk sure puts raggin’ into a feller’s </p><p>feet and the rags on his back. Makes him </p><p>raggy, ragged and rank. I’ve been loaf- </p><p>ing around this joint a week when I’d </p><p>ought to been out to my diggins gatherin’ </p><p>in a pooch-full of dust instead of spendin’ </p><p>hit. Come 011 in. I’ll take a last drink </p><p>with you. I’m dry, myself.” </p><p> “W-E-E-LL look-e-e there!”</p><p>Carver was gazing intently at </p><p>something that had appeared out </p><p>of the blistering hills at the upper end of </p><p>the gulch. A half-human object that pro- </p><p>gressed in weird humpings and stumblings </p><p>among the hot, rounded boulders of the </p><p>creek bed. </p><p> “Well, I’d say,” mumbled Spade, leering</p><p>half-heartedly at the bobbing figure. “Looks </p><p>like a whinny-diddle.” </p><p> “Something coming to git yuh, Spade,”</p><p>Moore jeered. “By Judas, the prophet’s </p><p>right. Strong drink is raging—I see it </p><p>myself. I’m goin’ to take a drink of </p><p>water.” </p><p> “It’s a man, thot’s what it is,” Carver</p><p>stated. Together they peered through the </p><p>shimmering heat waves at the humping </p><p>object. Obadiah set down his tool-kit and </p><p>stared with the others. </p><p> “Yuh see hit too, Parson?” queried</p><p>Moore. </p><p> “I—yes, my eyes—” Obadiah brushed</p><p>the back of his hand across his face and</p><p>shaded his eyes with both hands. “Yes— </p><p>and I think it’s a man. Possibly some </p><p>prospector out of water. We’d better go </p><p>up and do what we can to help him out.” </p><p> “What! Up there in that sun?” grum-</p><p>bled Spade. “You’re crazier ’n I am, an’ </p><p>I’m drunk an’ you’re not. Go nothin’. </p><p>Send for Gawd. Let him do it. That’s </p><p>his trade, savin’ fellers.” </p><p> “Aw, come on, Spade.” Moore slapped</p><p>Gowdy’s broad back with his open hand. </p><p>“I know you’re drunk, Spade, and it’ll half </p><p>kill you to walk out in that sun, but I just </p><p>got a hankerin’ to see. Come on; we’re </p><p>goin’, too.” </p><p> Already Obadiah and Carver were twenty</p><p>yards up the gulch, stumbling over the </p><p>loose, hot stones and splashing around the </p><p>pools of tepid black water. Moore seized </p><p>Spade by the buckle of his protruding belt </p><p>and dragged him, protesting, after. </p><p> “Mustn’t let him drink much of this</p><p>water,” chattered Obadiah as he and the </p><p>Irishman struggled forward, “if it’s a thirsty </p><p>prospector. Yes, see, he's down drinking </p><p>a barrel of it. Come on, let’s hurry!” </p><p> A moment more and Obadiah had the</p><p>shaggy head of the heat-crazed prospector </p><p>in his lap, shading the tormented man as </p><p>best he could with his body and bathing the </p><p>parched lips and brow. Spade and Moore, </p><p>scarce a minute behind, fell upon the pros- </p><p>pector’s sack of ore, which Carver had </p><p>already found and was emptying excitedly </p><p>upon the sand. </p><p> “Gold!” yelled Spade.</p><p> “Gold!” howled Carver. “Mine—I got</p><p>it—it’s mine, I tell ye!” </p><p> “Shut up.” Moore’s heavy hand crashed</p><p>full against Spade Gowdy’s thick mouth </p><p>and he shoved Carver aside. “Don’t </p><p>wake up the whole camp. Course it’s gold. </p><p>What else do you reckon a man ’d pack </p><p>till he croaked alive like that feller’s </p><p>a-doin?” He indicated the prostrated </p><p>man. </p><p> “Sure, an’ I b’lave the parson’d pack his</p><p>paint-pot,” soothed Carver diplomatically. </p><p> The three peered surreptitiously back</p><p>toward El Oro to see if, by any chance, </p><p>some one had ventured out in the noon </p><p>sun and seen them. Ail appeared quiet. </p><p>The camp, squatting low amid the baking </p><p>boulders and shimmering in the heat, ap- </p><p>peared deserted. No living thing was im </p><p>sight. Only the heat waves danced along, </p><p>the crooked white street, distorting the </p><p>buildings into fantastic shapes. </p><p> “Let’s hide it,” suggested Spade, jerking</p><p>his head toward the ore, “an’ him, too.” </p><p>He motioned to the prospector and winked </p><p>significantly. </p><p> “Know him? Any of you know this</p><p>man?” interrupted Obadiah anxiously, fan- </p><p>ning the patient with his hat. “I’m afraid </p><p>he’s in bad shape.” </p><p>44 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Not half as bad as he will be in a min-</p><p>ute,” growled Spade. </p><p> “Help me carry him to camp, boys,”</p><p>begged Obadiah. </p><p> “Where’d he git this rock he’s packin’,</p><p>Spade?” Moore ignored Obadiah’s plea. </p><p>“Let’s smuggle ’im off somewheres an’ </p><p>when he comes alive make him tell where </p><p>he got hit at.” </p><p> “You bet, make him tell!” grunted</p><p>Spade from where, on his knees, he was </p><p>gloating over the chunks of gold-flecked </p><p>rock. “Gold—pure yaUer gold! Talk about </p><p>Gawd—well, here he is. This is what </p><p>everybody worships and grovels down </p><p>to.” </p><p> “Lucky dog,” murmured Carver, eying</p><p>the prostrate prospector. “Lucky dog— </p><p>say! Sa-a-a-a-y!” </p><p> Carver looked from one to the other of</p><p>his companions, then crept softly to the </p><p>still figure and, bending over it, searched </p><p>the pockets deftly. </p><p> “ ‘Thou shalt not steal,’ ” reminded Oba-</p><p>diah gently. </p><p> “Bah, ye little snipe!” barked Carver.</p><p>“Ah, a-a-ah!” Eagerly his fingers drew forth </p><p>the grimy location notice. Unfolding it, he </p><p>glanced over the heading and skipped </p><p>eagerly down to the location. “ ‘In the </p><p>Jackear Peak district,’ ” he read half aloud, </p><p>“ ‘about one hundred and twenty miles in </p><p>a southwesterly direction from El Oro!’ ” </p><p>That was all. Anxiously they gathered </p><p>together and searched the document for </p><p>further guidance. There was none. The </p><p>name of the locator was signed “Henry </p><p>Blane” in a forceful scrawl, as if the writer, </p><p>at last the possessor of a fortune, had </p><p>managed to convey his pride into his writ- </p><p>ing. Clearly Henry Blane had found a </p><p>bonanza and was on his way to file his </p><p>location notice. Immediately the three </p><p>men became acutely solicitous as to Henry’s </p><p>welfare. </p><p> “Here, Parson—” seizing Henry Blane’s</p><p>limp shoulders Moore lifted them clear of</p><p>the hot sands—“help me pack him over to </p><p>my cabin.” </p><p> “Not much—to mine!” demanded Car-</p><p>eer, glaring at Moore indignantly. </p><p> “Both wrong!” Spade started forward,</p><p>an evil glint in his dark eyes. “We’ll pack </p><p>him to—to—” Spade hesitated as his eyes </p><p>caught the gleaming rock scattered on the </p><p>sand. “No, go ahead, any-place.” </p><p> Craftily, as the others lifted the limp</p><p>form, Spade thrust the rich rock back into </p><p>the sack and essayed to slip away among </p><p>the brush and boulders. </p><p> Moore, seeing him, halted and unfeel-</p><p>ingly let the fore end of Henry drop heavily </p><p>as he drew his huge six-shooter. </p><p> “Come on back with that sack, Spade,”</p><p>he ordered, “or we’ll lynch you here an’ </p><p>now! Don’t make me bring eveiybody out </p><p>from El Oro by my shootin’.” </p><p> Spade was loath and slow to obey.</p><p> “Come on back, you fat booze-hound,”</p><p>Moore gritted, drawing back the heavy </p><p>hammer with a pronounced click. “Come </p><p>on in!” </p><p> “Yes, come on in,” added Carver; “lay</p><p>thot sack on Hennery’s belly an’ grab holt </p><p>his belt opposite the parson there.” </p><p> “And we can take him to my cabin,”</p><p>offered Obadiah; “it’s the nearest, anyhow. </p><p>I can take good care of him there, boys. </p><p>Come on, Mr. Gowdy, please, and help take </p><p>this man to my house.” </p><p> Sullenly Spade obeyed, placing the sack</p><p>of ore on Henry’s lank middle and assisting </p><p>as Carver had suggested. Thus they stole </p><p>to Obadiah’s neat little cabin on the out- </p><p>skirts of El Oro and set about bringing </p><p>their patient back to consciousness. </p><p> Henry Blane responded nobly to their</p><p>ridiculous ministrations. While his eyes </p><p>were yet dimmed with hallucination, his </p><p>first thought was for his sack of ore. </p><p> “Where’s my sack?” he demanded thickly.</p><p>Then, his sight clearing momentarily, he </p><p>glimpsed the faces of Spade, Carver and </p><p>Moore bending over him. He quickly </p><p>amended it to: “Which one o’ you got my </p><p>sack? Which one, I say.” Desperately he </p><p>raised himself on one elbow and clawed for </p><p>his gun. Finding the weapon gone, he sank </p><p>back resignedly. “Take it. I know where </p><p>there’s a ledge of it as long as a crazy man’s </p><p>dream. I was a fool to bring any of it along. </p><p>Awful rough traveling—hot—straight up </p><p>an’ down—more’n a hundred an’ twenty </p><p>mile—cactus an’ brush—rock an’ loose </p><p>gravel—sand, sand, sand—sand an’ </p><p>sun-” </p><p>TWENTY minutes later Henry </p><p>Blane awoke, again to inquire after </p><p>his sack. Then, once more seeing </p><p>the three hard visages hovering solicitously </p><p>about his cot, he grunted resignedly— </p><p>“Fat chanct a sick feller’s got with this </p><p>layout.” </p><p>Three Wise Men </p><p>45 </p><p> “Why, here’s your sack, Hank, right</p><p>here,” bellowed Spade jovially in his best </p><p>saloon-welcome manner, being exceedingly </p><p>anxious to retain the esteem of Henry Blane. </p><p> “Shure,” seconded Carver, equally as</p><p>merrily. “We was only bringin’ it along </p><p>for ye to have whin ye woken up, Hennery.” </p><p>He added his hand to help Spade lay the </p><p>sack in Henry’s lap. Jim Moore, too, put </p><p>forth a hand to assist in the presentation. </p><p> “Well I be blowed,” gasped Henry, all</p><p>precedent shaken to the foundation. Then, </p><p>seeing Obadiah hovering on the outskirts </p><p>of the trio, Henry suddenly understood. </p><p>“Ho, there’s a parson.” He settled back in </p><p>relief. “Got a parson in camp, hev you? </p><p>I see now—he made you bring it along. </p><p>Didn’t you, parson? How’d you do it, </p><p>anyhow? They’d got off with it ef you </p><p>hadn’t been watchin’, that I know. Me, </p><p>too, like as not. Eh, parson?” </p><p> “W-w-why, no. I—I’m not a reg’lar</p><p>parson, I—I just try to be. An’ they—” </p><p>Obadiah strove to believe he was telling </p><p>the truth—“they aimed to bring it along, </p><p>all right. They’d fixed you up ’thout me.” </p><p>“I’ll bet they would,” grunted Henry </p><p>Blane positively. </p><p> “I’m Gowdy,” Spade began heartily.</p><p>“I run the Nugget Saloon here in camp. </p><p>When you git to feelin’ like it come around </p><p>and we’ll show you a good time. The </p><p>place’ll be yours, an’ the house foots the </p><p>bill. This here’s Dan Carver, one of my </p><p>best bar-men. And this here’s Jim Moore, </p><p>one of the camp’s biggest sluicers. He </p><p>owns a mess of the best placer claims along </p><p>the gulch. An’ say, Hank, being’s you’ve </p><p>already staked off what you want of your </p><p>new discovery, can’t you let us in on what's </p><p>left?” Spade paused expectantly. </p><p> Henry looked around dubiously.</p><p>“We-e-ll,” he began slowly, “they ain’t </p><p>much use tellin’. They’s only ’bout room </p><p>for one more stakin’. Ych, just ’bout room </p><p>for one more. ’Tain’t no cause for a stam- </p><p>pede, as they’s only room for one more.” </p><p>“Only one?” wailed Spade in dismay. </p><p>“Thought you said it was a long one.” </p><p>“Well, it is a long one, considerin’ the</p><p>quality. Six feet of it ’d make rich men </p><p>out o’ a dozen paupers. Minute I see thet </p><p>outcrop I begun puttin’ up stakes an’ </p><p>monument rocks like a steamboat nigger </p><p>hustlin’ watermelons out o’ a melon patch </p><p>at night. Then, like a fool, I chips off </p><p>this forty pound o’ ore an’ hikes for to </p><p>record. I’m here now, ain’t I? An’ in a </p><p>minnit I’ll be over at the recorder’s office, </p><p>yeh.” </p><p> “Just right,” assented Moore, “that’s</p><p>the way to do business. But now, consid- </p><p>erin’ who picked you up, savin’ yore life, </p><p>so to speak, why not go ahead an’ tell us </p><p>where this ledge is, so we c’n get what’s </p><p>left. We’ll stake her an’ divide it amongst </p><p>us.” </p><p> Still Henry Blanc was reticent.</p><p> “Aw, come on, Hennery,” Carver whee-</p><p>dled. “We won’t tell anybody. There’ll </p><p>be no stampede. We’ll just slip out an’ </p><p>stake her off an’ come back and record. </p><p>Jist look who saved yer life.” </p><p> “Jus’ look!” mumbled Henry, his eyes</p><p>roving over his saviors. “Yeah, jus’ look! </p><p>Still, I reckon f mought as well tell you </p><p>fdlers as anybody else. You can fight it </p><p>out amongst yerselves. I got mine all </p><p>safe, an’ there’s a million in sight left over, </p><p>so you oughtn’t have much trouble dividin’ </p><p>it. Now listen—I’m only goin’ to say it </p><p>jus’ once: </p><p> “It lays in a little canon on this slope of</p><p>the Jackear Mountains, about the middle </p><p>of the range, nearest the peaks. To git </p><p>there go out to Sandy Spring, thirty mile </p><p>west of El Oro, and then slew off southwest </p><p>straight toward them Jackears. When you </p><p>find the right canon, foller up it till you </p><p>come to a break—a plumb, blank wall that </p><p>juts right up out o’ the canon bed. This </p><p>falls is white rock'—you'll know it when </p><p>you see it if you’ve had to trace a dozen </p><p>other canons before you hit the right one. </p><p>Well, when you find this white wall in the </p><p>canon, you’ll know you’re in the right one, </p><p>so go on over and follow up the canon about </p><p>a quarter mile more, where you’ll come to </p><p>a spring with some grass around it. </p><p> “There’ll likely be a couple o’ burros</p><p>there—mine. I left ’em there so’s to make</p><p>better speed gettin’ here. It’s a turrible </p><p>rough country between here and there— </p><p>straight up an’ down, and a jack can’t </p><p>hardly make it, an’ feed’s scarce as honesty </p><p>in politics. I wanted to come straight </p><p>across and climb the bluffs where I pleased, </p><p>so I left my burros behind. It’d take two </p><p>days longer with jacks.” </p><p> “Yes, I know it’s rough country,” con-</p><p>conceded Moore. “I been as far as Sandy </p><p>Spring and I could see it’s rougher ’n- </p><p>beyond. Go ahead an’ tell us how to find </p><p>your ledge after we get to the spring where </p><p>46 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>you left yore jackasses. On up the canon?” </p><p>“Yeah, on up the canon,” resumed </p><p>Henry. “f)n up about a hundred yards. </p><p>You’H see it—ledge crosses the canon floor; </p><p>sticks up ’bout a foot all along. My stakes </p><p>are on the right side. Take all you see to </p><p>the left. There’s a million there.” </p><p> “Come on, men!” Spade turned to go.</p><p>“Let’s start!” </p><p> Carver and Moore, without a word, fell</p><p>in behind him. Only Obadiah tarried. </p><p> “Thank you, Mr. Blane!” Obadiah spoke</p><p>fervently. “Thank you ever so much. I </p><p>just feel that this is my chance. We thank </p><p>you ever so much. Use the house while </p><p>I’m gone.” </p><p>OBADIAH had to run to catch up </p><p>with his late companions. Hearing </p><p>his footsteps, they turned. Spade </p><p>appraised Obadiah scornfully. </p><p> “Why, hello, Jehovah!” he drawled in-</p><p>sultingly. “Where’d you think you’re </p><p>goin’?” </p><p> “Why, w-w-hy I’m—I want to go along</p><p>with you, boys,” stammered Obadiah, an </p><p>anxious look clouding his face. </p><p> Spade cursed viciously. So did Moore</p><p>and Carver. </p><p> “No! No! Ye poor nut,” protested Car-</p><p>ver hastily, “it’ll be an awful thrip. You’d </p><p>niver git more’n half-way there. You’re </p><p>too—too weak, parson.” </p><p> “Sure, weak!” raged Spade. “Why if</p><p>that dried up little apostle can hike out to </p><p>where we’re goin’ I c’n walk to Jerusalem </p><p>an’ back in an hour. Why, you little wart” </p><p>—Spade glared down at Obadiah—“this is </p><p>a he-man’s game. Trot back to your </p><p>Bibles, pronto!” </p><p> “You’d never make it, preacher,” added</p><p>Moore pacifyingly. “It’s a hundred and </p><p>twenty miles of the roughest, hottest going </p><p>this side of-. No use your even want- </p><p>in’ to go.”</p><p> “Oh!” Obadiah’s tone expressed real</p><p>agony. “Oh, boys, let me go along! </p><p>Please! Let me try, anyhow! I won’t ask </p><p>any favors. If I can’t make it I’ll drop </p><p>out quiet-like. I’ll take my chances with </p><p>the rest of you. Just let me go along, </p><p>please! Then we’ll all be together and can </p><p>stake out the claim in all our names and </p><p>we’ll all have plenty. It’s my only chance </p><p>to make good. I just feel-” </p><p> “Shut up, chatterbox,” growled Spade</p><p>menacingly. “You can’t go. We can’t </p><p>pack no cripples or babies along. We’ll </p><p>have all we can do to make it ourselves. </p><p>Come along, fellers.” </p><p> “Spade’s right, parson,” added Moore,</p><p>as they turned to go. “You wouldn’t be </p><p>much force. We’ll count you in on it, </p><p>anyhow. Just keep yore mouth shut about </p><p>where we went er you’ll wish yuh had.” </p><p> But Obadiah Higgins was not to be so</p><p>easily talked out of his one great oppor- </p><p>tunity. He followed, terrified lest he lose </p><p>his one golden chancc to make good. He </p><p>grabbed Carver and Moore by the sleeves </p><p>of the soiled undershirts they wore. </p><p> “I’m going with you! I’m going too!”</p><p>he panted, eagerly appealing from face to </p><p>face, hoping to find a gleam of kindness. </p><p>Their faces were expressionless and hard. </p><p>His heart sank. “I’m goin’ with you,” he </p><p>insisted doggedly. </p><p> Spade Gowdy struck Obadiah’s none too</p><p>firm chin with something like two hundred </p><p>and twenty pounds back of the blow. </p><p>Obadiah came up, dusty and weeping with </p><p>rage. Wordlessly he attacked the aston- </p><p>ished Spade with a hail of futile blows that </p><p>at best reached no higher than Spade’s </p><p>thick, hairy chest. </p><p> “Haw,” sneered Spade, "you’re too white</p><p>around the gills. Git away!” </p><p> With that he heaved with his open hand</p><p>against Obadiah’s meager stomach and </p><p>doubled him sobbing in the dust. </p><p> “Now, here, Obadiah,” Carver bent over</p><p>the cramped little figure. “You gotta go</p><p>aisy if you hopes to finish out the natural </p><p>course of yer existence. You’re goin’ to </p><p>git hurted if you continue buttin’ into this </p><p>party in this manner. Now I’ll tell ye </p><p>what we’ll do. If you’ll go home now an’ </p><p>get yer pack ready we’ll call along in about </p><p>ten minutes and git you and we’ll all go </p><p>together. But mind, if you say a word </p><p>about this to a soul, now or ever, you’re a </p><p>goner!” </p><p> “Oh, I won’t! I won’t tell! I’ll go</p><p>right home and get ready to go along. Oh, </p><p>I’m so glad!” rejoiced Obadiah, the light </p><p>of supreme happiness written all over his </p><p>face. “You’ll never be sorry you took me </p><p>along. Why, I’ve tramped lots and I can </p><p>stand the hottest kind of sun. You know </p><p>I’ve worked steady around Oro the last six </p><p>months, and I’m tough as whang leather. </p><p>I’ll go right home and fix up my outfit. </p><p>I been in lots of stampedes, too, and I know </p><p>just what kind of a pack I’ll need.” </p><p>A </p><p>Three Wise Men </p><p>47 </p><p> Obadiah turned back happily and trot-</p><p>ted with a surprizingly springy step toward </p><p>his cabin. </p><p> “Well, come on—let’s outfit,” ordered</p><p>Moore sharply. “Hustle!” </p><p> Together they hurried along the hot,</p><p>empty street to make ready for their de- </p><p>parture. Ten minutes later they appeared, </p><p>purposefully prodding a single laden burro </p><p>out of town in the direction of Sandy Spring. </p><p> Obadiah Higgins, standing impatiently</p><p>waiting in his own doorway, saw them go. </p><p>He watched them as they skirted the few </p><p>shacks at the edge of the town and turned </p><p>into the little-used trail that led to Sandy </p><p>Spring. He watched them until they be- </p><p>came but an indistinguishable huddle, bob- </p><p>bing about in the slanting evening sun- </p><p>light, vanishing momentarily in the choppy </p><p>gulches only to reappear, a wavering dot, </p><p>in the white road against the ridges. </p><p> “They didn’t want me,” murmured Oba-</p><p>diah without malice. “They didn’t want </p><p>me to go along.” </p><p> Turning, he picked up the little bundle</p><p>he had prepared and started out alone, liis </p><p>gaze riveted on the Jackcar Mountains, </p><p>which showed low-lying and purple across </p><p>the intervening miles of gashed and broken </p><p>hills. </p><p> The combined gaze of Moore, Carver and</p><p>Spade was also turned upon that purpling </p><p>heap that rimmed the far horizon. Some- </p><p>where on the slope of that rugged range </p><p>lay a tiny, rain-gutted canon with a blind </p><p>wall—and a million-dollar prize. Eagerly </p><p>the three strained their vision toward the </p><p>distant peaks and prodded the jack pur- </p><p>posefully. Thirty miles would the beast </p><p>carry their packs; the remaining distance </p><p>of almost impassable country each man </p><p>would carry his own pack and canteen. </p><p>THE next morning the great sun </p><p>poked his hot orb over the desert </p><p>rim and smote them hotly with his </p><p>first rays. Still they plodded the trail to </p><p>Sandy Spring. It was an hour later when </p><p>they reached their goal. Thirty miles they</p><p>had come. Almost without conversation </p><p>they unpacked the burro, released him and, </p><p>in the shade of the mesquite and luxuriant </p><p>water-weed, they wearily cooked and ate </p><p>their first meal of the trip and lay down to </p><p>sleep. Their packs, to be light as possible, </p><p>permitted of no blankets, so the three deter- </p><p>minedly scooped hollows in the sand. </p><p> The sun hung low in the west that even-</p><p>ing before they resumed their journey. </p><p>They had rested, eaten, arranged their </p><p>packs and filled their canteens. Eagerly, </p><p>each with his burden, they resumed their </p><p>difficult progress. Each hill-top they </p><p>reached, every canon-crest they topped, </p><p>gave them a glimpse of their goal—the </p><p>Jackear Peaks, a purple and white phan- </p><p>tasm far to the southwest. It speeded their </p><p>steps like the sound of running water to a </p><p>thirsty man. </p><p> Their muscles, unused to heavy work,</p><p>protested against the pace and each broke </p><p>into an unhealthy perspiration. With the </p><p>sweat streaming from them, the setting of </p><p>the sun was as welcome as a cooling rain. </p><p>They paused on a barren hog-back to catch </p><p>the faint breath of air that stirred the sea </p><p>of heat about them. The country that lay </p><p>between them and the Jackears spread a </p><p>gashed and canoned maze of gravel hills </p><p>and precipitous cliffs. The entire hundreds </p><p>of square miles of watershed sloped to the" </p><p>southeast, and countless canons and washes </p><p>had carved their gulches in the same direc- </p><p>tion, pouring their periodical rushes of </p><p>water into the boulder-strewn channel that </p><p>drained the watershed into the Gila. </p><p> To reach the Jackears without going</p><p>completely around the vast watershed, </p><p>they would necessarily lie obliged to cross </p><p>ever)' one of the myriad gulches. Thus, </p><p>each time they topped a ridge, it was only </p><p>to scramble down the opposite slope, then </p><p>across the canon floor and up the other </p><p>side. Up and over, across, up and over— </p><p>constantly. </p><p> It was like going across a great city with-</p><p>out using the streets. They would climb </p><p>up the front of the first row of dwellings, </p><p>zigzag across the roof-tops, avoiding sky- </p><p>lights, air-shafts and chimneys; thence </p><p>slither down the window-ledges and water- </p><p>pipes at the rear; cross the alleyway only </p><p>to be confronted by the necessity of climb-</p><p>ing up the rear of the next row and across </p><p>the roof-tops and down the fronts into the </p><p>street. Once across the street, it would be </p><p>up and over again and again. Well, that </p><p>was the sort of a situation Moore and his </p><p>companions were in. </p><p> Added to their difficulties were the tan-</p><p>gled growths of mesquite, greasewood and </p><p>cactus, the loose boulders and hot sands </p><p>underfoot, coupled with the lack of water </p><p>and the great abundance of heat. So, with </p><p>48 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>a sigh of regret, the three resumed their </p><p>march, stumbling down the slope, kicking </p><p>loose gravel into their shoe-tops and bat- </p><p>tling with the thorny brush that tore them </p><p>mercilessly in the growing dusk. </p><p> Throughout the interminable night they</p><p>toiled. They had decided to travel at </p><p>night, thinking the cooler air without the </p><p>sun’s burning heat would enable them to </p><p>make better time. They figured they </p><p>could make the remaining ninety miles in </p><p>at least three nights’ travel. “Walk nights </p><p>and rest days,” they had agreed. So in </p><p>the darkness they fought their way; cross- </p><p>ing the canons and laboring over the ridges; </p><p>laying their course as best they could by </p><p>the stars. Though there was a moon, it was </p><p>waning and the far-distant Jackear Peaks </p><p>were not visible as a guide, and the light </p><p>the moon afforded was negligible. Long </p><p>before the sun rimmed the eastern horizon </p><p>with red, Spade Gowdy felt the need of a </p><p>drink. </p><p> “Didn’t anybody bring some whisky</p><p>along?” he growled petulantly. “By-, </p><p>this is the first time I ever went anywhere </p><p>without whisky. I’d give ten bucks for jus’ </p><p>one shot, right now. Carver, why’n- </p><p>didn’t you think to bring some whisky?” </p><p> “Why’n’t you?” snapped Carver. “I</p><p>feel mysilf a dhrink or two wouldn’t harm </p><p>a body. But what’s the use discussin’? </p><p>We wouldn’t carry it if we had it. I got </p><p>a plenty to pack as it is; fifteen pound I </p><p>must have, an’ it feels like a ton. No, we </p><p>don’t want whisky.” </p><p> “I do,” insist*! Spade. “I do! An’ I</p><p>gotta have a drink, I tell you!” </p><p> “Aw, take a drink of water,” broke in</p><p>Moore. “You’re lucky to have that. Bet- </p><p>ter go easy on it, too. It may not last.” </p><p> “Water!” scoffed Spade. “Dishwater!</p><p>Tastes like a chip. I’d rather drink the </p><p>washings from the bar-sink. - any</p><p>man that’d go off on a trip like this without </p><p>whisky.” </p><p> “Cut out the hard luck tale, Spade.</p><p>’Twill be hot enough in an hour an’ we c’n </p><p>slape. Kape your eyes open fer wather </p><p>sign—canteens’ll be dhry by night—How- </p><p>lee Moses! Moore, where’re ye headin’? </p><p>Look, man, Jackear Mountains are down </p><p>that way—not as ye’re goin’!” </p><p> Moore, in the lead, paused and followed</p><p>Carver’s pointing finger to where, far down </p><p>the horizon, loomed the purple maze of </p><p>the Jackear range. He had been leading </p><p>them almost due west instead of southwest. </p><p>They had been crossing the canons at an </p><p>almost imperceptible slant to the west. </p><p> Moore cursed vividly.</p><p> “Well, this ends night travel. How long</p><p>we been off the track I don’t know—eight </p><p>mile—maybe ten. You bet we’ll travel </p><p>by daylight if it scorches the inside edges </p><p>of my gizzard. Henceforth we plow </p><p>straight for that peak. It’s up and down </p><p>like this all the way anyhow, so we might </p><p>as well try to save by going it straight. </p><p>Here we are, out maybe six miles of the </p><p>hardest going this side of forty years in the </p><p>wilderness.” </p><p> ‘ ‘Howly M ither! ’ ’ groaned Carver. ‘ ‘An’</p><p>what’s worse, we gotta walk ’em yet to </p><p>catch up to where we’d ’a’ been if we hadn’t </p><p>walked ’em already. Howiver, there’s a </p><p>consolation—the farther we go, the more </p><p>likely we be to find a watherin’-place,” he </p><p>finished hopefully. </p><p> “Come on, Spade; wake up!” Moore</p><p>shook Gowdy, who had wilted against a </p><p>boulder. “You’re a hot specimen to go </p><p>prospectin’.” He kicked Spade to his feet. </p><p> Two hours hard travel down a canon</p><p>brought them upon a tiny seep at the base </p><p>of a sheer canon wall, where a cupful of </p><p>water could be extracted at half-hour inter- </p><p>vals. </p><p> Exhausted, they prepared to sleep the</p><p>day out, taking turns watching the water </p><p>that their canteens might be replenished. </p><p>Continually Spade bewailed the lack of</p><p>liquor. His body, so long steeped in drink, </p><p>craved it to an excruciating degree. Nei- </p><p>ther food nor water could satisfy; it was </p><p>whisky that Spade Gowdy craved; his face </p><p>and the palms of his hands already had </p><p>begun to swell; his thick speech and strange </p><p>eyes told of the torture he was suffering. </p><p> His companions, distressed, but in a</p><p>lesser degree, did not seek to ease hisTnisery. </p><p>Better for them, they reasoned, Spade </p><p>should drop out. Spade was a burden; </p><p>with him out of the way they could make </p><p>better time, and the riches at the end </p><p>could be divided fifty-fifty. A two-way </p><p>split meant a half million dollars, and a </p><p>half million dollars will buy—yes, quite a </p><p>lot of things. </p><p> At evening the discussion arose as to</p><p>whether they should travel this night or </p><p>await the dawn. Their rapacious minds </p><p>reasoned for haste, but their sore muscles </p><p>parleyed for rest. In the end they decided </p><p>Three Wise Men </p><p>49 </p><p>to abide by Moore’s advice and resume the </p><p>journey at dawn rather than chance going </p><p>astray in the darkness. </p><p>IT WAS Jim Moore who insisted </p><p>upon the delay and it was Jim </p><p>Moore who, an hour later, assuring </p><p>himself the others were asleep, took his can- </p><p>teen and slipped away in the direction of </p><p>the Jackear range. He was not afraid of </p><p>losing his way; Jim Moore could lay a </p><p>straight course in any country by night. </p><p>Deliberately he had planned to abandon </p><p>his companions and gain the prize alone— </p><p>a million dollars and a oneway split. </p><p> The discomfort of lying on a gravel bed</p><p>with muscles stiff and aching from unac- </p><p>customed use, together with several hours </p><p>of sleep during the day, left Carver a trifle </p><p>wakeful. He had been lying in the sand </p><p>wooing slumber when he heard Moore’s </p><p>slight stepping. When he was satisfied </p><p>Moore had not merely gone to the seep for </p><p>a drink, Carver raised his head and peered </p><p>after the huge figure that showed darkly </p><p>against the stony face of the canon wall. </p><p>Without emotion Carver impassionately </p><p>drew his gun from its holster and fired. </p><p>The range was not long, yet Carver missed. </p><p>Moore wheeled to return the fire, but Car- </p><p>ver beat him to it—two shots in quick suc- </p><p>cession. </p><p>“Cut it out!” yelled Moore. “You got </p><p>me in the leg! I’m cornin’ back anyhow.” </p><p>“You’d better!” grunted Carver savagely. </p><p>“Why, what’s the matter?” Moore </p><p>whined. “I was just huntin’ a place for </p><p>us to get out of this canon in the morning.” </p><p>“Yis, wid yer outfit all on yer back.” </p><p>Spade had awakened at the shots. </p><p>“What’s the shootin’. What’s goin’ on </p><p>here?” he gabbled. “Who’n -” </p><p> Moore’s voice from the darkness an-</p><p>swered the question. </p><p> “That’s all right, Carver,” he compro-</p><p>mised ingratiatingly, “I want to come in. </p><p>Cut out the shootin’, Carver; my leg’s </p><p>hurtin’ somethin’ powerful. Third of a </p><p>million’ll do me, anyhow.” </p><p> Long before sunrise they had taken up</p><p>their painful journey. They calculated </p><p>they were sixty miles from their prize. </p><p>Sixty miles may not be a great distance </p><p>over a well-defined road or trail, but it can </p><p>lengthen out into a horror when cut and </p><p>gashed by canons and barricaded by thick- </p><p>ets of thorny brush and great gravel ridges. </p><p>4 </p><p>Those sixty miles up and over, down and </p><p>through, detouring rocky gorges and clam- </p><p>bering over craggy precipices, doubly ham- </p><p>pered by Moore’s injured leg and Spade’s </p><p>growing delirium, were full of toil and </p><p>pain. </p><p> The day passed in laborious misery. They</p><p>traveled possibly fifteen miles in ten agon- </p><p>izing hours. The night was spent in fitful </p><p>sleep and on the morrow they took up their </p><p>task. Moore’s injury grew steadily more </p><p>painful. Of the three, only one, Carver, </p><p>was in anything like fair shape. </p><p> Spade Gowdy had long since ceased to</p><p>think, and traveled erratically, battling with </p><p>invisible monsters and reptiles. His crav- </p><p>ing for whisky was only equaled by his </p><p>craving for rest. He ate almost nothing, </p><p>and what he did eat he could not assimilate; </p><p>his figure became emaciated and his mus- </p><p>cles responded slowly. Only occasionally </p><p>was his mind rational. At such times he </p><p>begged piteously for liquor and cursed them </p><p>vehemently for their negligence in coming, </p><p>away without whisky. Yet he hung in </p><p>line, staggering awfully to keep up, grimly, </p><p>clinging to the almost forgotten' hope of </p><p>sharing in the prize that lay in the little </p><p>canon of the Jackear Mountains. </p><p> Jim Moore hobbled at the rear, partly</p><p>because of his injury but principally to </p><p>prevent Carver from going on alone. There </p><p>existed armed peace between Moore and </p><p>Carver, with the latter constantly alert to </p><p>seize any opportunity to slip off and leave </p><p>the slower pair. Moore was equally vigi- </p><p>lant to prevent him. Each, therefore, </p><p>slept but little. </p><p> There were hours when they all suffered</p><p>agonies of thirst. Water was scarce, yet it </p><p>existed in sufficient quantities that the </p><p>travelers might, by making miles in futile </p><p>search, find enough to keep them alive as</p><p>they went! along. For food they cared </p><p>little, but watef—water they must have. </p><p>Sometimes they came upon water when </p><p>their canteens were already full. Then they </p><p>would drink as much as their empty stom- </p><p>achs could possibly hold, and stagger on, </p><p>harboring the sloshing fluid in their heavy </p><p>canteens for fear of not finding water </p><p>again. </p><p> Then at times they would find water, only</p><p>after their canteens had long been dry and </p><p>their tongues and throats parched and </p><p>gummy. They would fling themselves </p><p>down beside or even in the lifesaving seep </p><p>50 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> and drink and gorge until they lay cramped</p><p> and vomiting upon the sands. These were</p><p> not true men of the desert. They had lived</p><p> to grow fat from the labor of others.</p><p> Four days later—the seventh from El Oro</p><p> —their search led up a'-Small canon, one</p><p> of hundreds that came down out of the</p><p> Jackear Mountains. Following this, they</p><p> reached a blind wall, a sheer white cliff jut-</p><p> ting abruptly from the canon floor.</p><p> Carver eyed Moore calculatingly.</p><p> “This is the cliff Henry Blane told us</p><p> about,” he said.</p><p> “Sure is,” replied Moore, his hand upon</p><p> the butt of his heavy six-shooter. “Go</p><p> ahead.”</p><p> “What about him?” Carver indicated</p><p> Spade.</p><p> Moore indifferently regarded the swollen</p><p> face and dull eyes of the once hearty lead-</p><p> ing citizen of Oro Gulch. Spade was be*</p><p> yond hope of being able to appreciate the</p><p> great consequences of the moment. Moore’s</p><p> "-eyes roved over the emaciated, puffed</p><p> figure arid he scratched the back of his hand</p><p> reflectively.</p><p> “He’s all in,” he remarked lightly “Let’s</p><p> leave him here.”</p><p> “All right,” agreed Carver. “Fifty-fifty?”</p><p> “Sure, fifty-fifty. Just right!”</p><p> “Half a million,” gloated Carver. “I’m</p><p> goin’ up.” He started to climb.</p><p> “Not too - far ahead of me, you</p><p> ain’t,” sT\arled Moore painfully dragging</p><p> his injured foot into step. “I’ll set the pace,</p><p> pardner; you can go ahead, but see to it</p><p> you don’t go too fast. We’re close to taw</p><p> an’ I don’t stand for no monkeyin’. I’m</p><p> goin’ to see that my name goes on that</p><p> discovery notice whether we either one of</p><p> us ever makes it back to El Oro or not,</p><p> sabc?”</p><p>WORDLESSLY they climbed over </p><p> the cliff. Then for a quarter mile</p><p> they followed the sand wash that,</p><p> during the rainy season, poured its flood over</p><p> the break behind them. Rounding one of</p><p> the countless crooks, they camc in sight of</p><p> an open glade with a spring and a grassy spot</p><p> about it. Two burros nodding under the</p><p> thick mesquite put their ears forward in-</p><p> quisitively.</p><p> “Henry’s burros,” exulted Carver.</p><p> “We’re in the right place. Henry left his</p><p> jacks at the spring. Tis only a step to</p><p> the big find.”</p><p> “Not sO fast, there,” warned Moore.</p><p>“I’m dry. That spring looks like a million </p><p>dollars to me. I’m goin’ to drink first.” </p><p> “Yis, an’ me, too. Shure I’m as dhry</p><p>as a conthribution box, almost. I’ll drink </p><p>wid ye.” </p><p> “But we ain’t goin’ to run for it.”</p><p> They approached the spring and, flat on</p><p>their bellies, they drank of the cool trickle. </p><p>Presently Moore raised his head and peered </p><p>intently at a reflection in the water. What </p><p>he saw caused him to look about, and there, </p><p>on the side of the huge rock that over- </p><p>shadowed and was reflected by the spring, </p><p>appeared in the big, boyish letters they </p><p>had learned to know so well: </p><p>Be not Deceived; God is not Mocked. </p><p> A few steps farther up the wash, where</p><p>the cold ashes of a dav-old camp-fire spread </p><p>white against the smoke-blackened base, a </p><p>great boulder bore the holy legend: </p><p>God giveth Power to the Faint. To them that </p><p>Have No Might, He increaseth strength. Isa. 40. </p><p> In silence the two men stared at each</p><p>other. Moore broke the spell. </p><p> “If he’s up there I’ll shoot him like killin'</p><p>sheep,” he whispered hoarsely, jerking his </p><p>head in the direction of the ledge. </p><p> Carver nodded approvingly.</p><p> In silence they arose, their six-shooters</p><p>naked in their hands, and stole up the wash </p><p>to where a ledge of inestimable richness</p><p>cut across the rock-ribbed canon, its gleam- </p><p>ing content seemingly mocking them in </p><p>their utter powerlessness, for their quarry </p><p>was not there. Minutely they scanned all </p><p>that was visible of the place. The rock </p><p>monuments and discovery stake placed by </p><p>Henry Blane were in view to the right, and </p><p>to the left were the neatly erected monu- </p><p>ments of another locator. On the huge, </p><p>rounded boulders about the discovery </p><p>stake were printed righteous sentences: </p><p>Thou art my Hope. </p><p>Exalt ye the Lo'rd. </p><p> Carver stooped to pr a nugget from the</p><p>rich vein. </p><p> “Goin’ to take a sackful?” inquired</p><p>Moore, himself breaking off a huge chunk </p><p>with a stone. </p><p> “Sack, nothin’,” exploded Carver. “I</p><p>got all I c’n do to get back to Oro. I’m </p><p>out o’ grub, almost.” Regretfully he gazed </p><p>Three Wise Men </p><p>5i </p><p>at the vein. “Million!” he muttered, cal- </p><p>culating the seamed ledge. “Million! If </p><p>thot ledge is ten feet deep there’s ten mill- </p><p>ion.” </p><p> Carver swore and slammed his heavy</p><p>gun down among the sand and stones of </p><p>the canon floor. </p><p> “If thot little runt was here now I’d</p><p>shoot ’im into a million scraps. I’d make </p><p>him look like a nickel’s worth of sausage </p><p>shot from a cannon. Well, I’m goin’ up </p><p>an’ look at his-location notice; mebby </p><p>the fool didn’t have sense enough to get it </p><p>straight at all.” </p><p> He cursed again, vehemently, as he strode</p><p>across to the location monument. </p><p> Moore followed. Together they drew</p><p>forth the folded paper from the piled stones. </p><p>Written upon it in a prim, stilted hand was </p><p>the description, according to the legal form, </p><p>of the location. The length and width of </p><p>the claim was set forth, and the distance </p><p>in feet from the point of the notice to each </p><p>end of the claim, together with the general </p><p>course of the claim, the date, and the local- </p><p>ity with reference to the Jackear Peaks. </p><p>The name of the claim was set down as </p><p>“The Crazy Man’s Dream” and the names </p><p>of the locators were recorded therein as: </p><p> Obadiah Higgins</p><p> Spade Gowdy</p><p> Jim Moore</p><p> Dan Carver.</p><p> Obadiah Higgins had made good.</p><p> The two men cursed vividly.</p><p> “He’s half-way to the recorder now,”</p><p>roared Moore, seizing the paper and rend- </p><p>ing it into bits, “but by-, if I catch </p><p>him before he gits thar, there’ll be one less </p><p>name on that paper. Here, Carver, you </p><p>catch up Henry’s jacks. Let’s see if we </p><p>c’n make it back to Oro. I can go without </p><p>eatin’, but I can’t hoof it. Git ’em! Let’s</p><p>go. Spade’s done for; leave ’im lay. No! </p><p>Don’t you try pickin’ up yore gun. I’m </p><p>th’ gunman now. I’ll teach you how to </p><p>shoot a pardner in the leg’n’ cripple ’im. </p><p>Git them jacks.” </p><p>KJjS A WEEK later two patient burros </p><p>swayed into El Oro. Dried sweat </p><p>stood on their shoulders and flanks </p><p>and they sucked thirstily at their lolling </p><p>tongues. The hair on their backs was </p><p>rumpled; evidently there had been riders </p><p>the day before or, perhaps, the week before </p><p>that. Straight to the little trough beside </p><p>the new well-curb they went and thrust </p><p>their parched muzzles gratefully into the </p><p>cool water. </p><p> Henry Blane, standing protectingly at</p><p>the side of Obadiah Higgins, who was con- </p><p>versing with a group gathered in front of </p><p>the recorder’s office, shaded his eyes with a </p><p>gnarled hand. </p><p> “Why,” he exclaimed surprizedly,</p><p>“them’s my burros!” </p><p> Satisfied, the two burros stood before the</p><p>new well-curb placidly shooing the flies </p><p>with their bristly tails. Above their droop- </p><p>ing heads and contentedly waving ears was </p><p>the holy reminder— </p><p>God is not mocked. </p><p>ASSIGNATS </p><p>Henty Leverage, </p><p>Aulhor of “TheIron Dollar." </p><p>VHEN Ivan with the long sur- </p><p>name walked down the beach </p><p>at Novgorod he found three </p><p>men. These men were sit- </p><p>ting on their haunches staring out over the </p><p>Japan Sea. Ivan spoke to them in English. </p><p> “I have a ship,” he said.</p><p> The first man glanced at the second; the</p><p>second stared at the third. They rose from </p><p>their haunches and wrapped their rags </p><p>around gaunt limbs. </p><p> “A ship in this accursed port?” asked one.</p><p> “A bloody lie!” exclaimed a second cast-</p><p>away. </p><p> “Ah hae me doots,” rasped a third</p><p>derelict. </p><p> “It is a fact, gentlemen,” said Ivan with</p><p>the long surname. “The ship is loading </p><p>between here and Vladivostok. She wants </p><p>but a master, a mate and an engineer.” </p><p> The three men grew sad. They had been</p><p>broken on the rack of peace. They had </p><p>come ashore at Novgorod in a leaking sam- </p><p>pan. The government of Japan was at </p><p>that moment interested in their where- </p><p>abouts. </p><p> “Our papers were lost in a great storm at</p><p>sea,” said the leader of the trio, whom men </p><p>called “Micky” McMasters. “You mind </p><p>the vast simoom?” </p><p> Ivan, the Russian, spread out his hands.</p><p>His great spade-shaped beard fluttered in </p><p>the warm Japanese breeze. He thumped a </p><p>be-medaled chest. </p><p> “Come with me!” he said. “Papers or</p><p>no papers—it is you three who shall take </p><p>the Shongpong out across the sea.” </p><p> “He talks like a poet writes,” whispered</p><p>“Red” Landyard, a Yankee mate, to Mike </p><p>Monkey, the Scotch engineer. </p><p> “Ah hae noo doot he’s read a wee bit.</p><p>How otherwise would he know we were on </p><p>the beach at Novgorod? There is a price </p><p>on our heads.” </p><p> Micky McMasters edged the big Russian</p><p>away from his whispering companions. </p><p> “This ship,” asked the little skipper,</p><p>“this boat you ’ave loading between ’ere </p><p>and Vladivostok—what flag does she fly?” </p><p>“Her home flag is Chinese. Her crew </p><p>are loyal Russians. Her cargo, now going </p><p>aboard, is caravan tea. This tea must be </p><p>taken to America where Victoria on the </p><p>Island of Vancouver is. Do you know the </p><p>route?” </p><p> Micky felt his heart thump like a mallet</p><p>inside a cask. He had sweated and toiled </p><p>and starved on the mud flats of Novgorod. </p><p>He sensed the coming of a bitter Winter. </p><p>And here was a hard-eyed Russian offering </p><p>him and his mates a ship for the Pacific </p><p>broadside, where white men walked and </p><p>roses bloomed and shirts could be worn. </p><p> “I’ve steamed and sailed, man and boy,”</p><p>he explained, “going on thirty years, i’m </p><p>’Umber born—at Great Grimsby on the </p><p>North Sea. My mate, the tall man with </p><p>the red face, is an American out of New </p><p>Bedford. My first engineer came from </p><p>Tyneside—where they build good ships. </p><p>We take no back-slack from nobody. Show </p><p>me your ship, says I, and I’ll work </p><p>’er across the Japan Sea and east by the </p><p>line to Victoria.” </p><p>52 </p><p>Assignats </p><p>53 </p><p> “That is settled,” said Ivan Alexandrov-</p><p>ski. “You may come with me.” </p><p>. Micky McMasters gathered the tattered </p><p>collar of his dungaree coat around his un- </p><p>shaven neck. </p><p> “One more question before it becomes a</p><p>contract,” he said suspiciously. “Are you </p><p>loyal Russian or are you Bolshevik?” </p><p> Ivan with the long surname smiled</p><p>blandly. He stroked his straggling beard. </p><p>He stared down at the little castaway. </p><p> “Loyal Russian,” he said. “I have a</p><p>home in Vladivostok—where Allied troops </p><p>are guarding.” </p><p> Micky turned, jerked his head toward his</p><p>mates who stood shivering in their rags, and </p><p>shouted: </p><p> “The contract’s signed! A fair thing for</p><p>all of us. We work the Shongpong across </p><p>the western Pacific.” </p><p> “Ye arranged about terms?” asked Mike</p><p>Monkey, siding up to the skipper and glanc- </p><p>ing at the Russian. </p><p> “Terms?”</p><p> “Bonuses and wages?”</p><p>“We’ll leave that to our noble friend.” </p><p>Mike gulped and spat to the mud flat. </p><p>“Last time Ah left that,” he said, “Ah had </p><p>nothing coming to me when Ah went </p><p>ashore.” </p><p> The Russian drew himself erect.</p><p> “The scale of wages,” he declared, “shall</p><p>be, for you three officers, one thousand </p><p>rubles a week—paid at Victoria.” </p><p> “How much is a ruble?” asked Mike.</p><p>“Two shillin’,” hissed the cockney </p><p>skipper. </p><p> “Twa shillin’? That make a hundred</p><p>pun a week! Ah hae noo doot it’ll be well </p><p>earned before the end of the passage.” </p><p>“Where’s the ship?” asked Red Land-</p><p>yard. “Show me the Shongpong!” </p><p> The Russian led the way up the beach.</p><p>Two hours stiff walking brought the cast- </p><p>aways to a cove in which lay a rusty tramp </p><p>flying the Chinese flag and swarming with </p><p>coolies—like ants on a cockroach. </p><p> Mike Monkey stared at the boxes which</p><p>the coolies were carrying aboard the </p><p>ship. </p><p> “Tay!” he spat. “Aya, it may be tay</p><p>and it may be something else. Them ain’t </p><p>Chinese marks on the sides.” </p><p> “Russian!” explained Ivan. “Come with</p><p>me aboard my ship. You can see the boxes </p><p>are marked with Russian letters.” </p><p> Micky McMasters jabbed the engineer.</p><p>in the ribs as they trailed up a shaky gang- </p><p>plank and sprang from the Shongpong’s un- </p><p>polished rail at the waist. </p><p> “Be careful!” he warned. “Don’t ask no</p><p>bloomin’ questions. * Wait till we cross the </p><p>Sea o’ Japan!”. </p><p> Mike gulped. He eyed the decrepit</p><p>back-stays and standing rigging of the </p><p>tramp. He ranged a fluttering glance </p><p>along the dirty planks of the freighter. He </p><p>shifted his tongue in his mouth as he </p><p>stared at the drunken-looking funnel, which </p><p>bore evidences of poorly patched shot </p><p>holes. </p><p> “A rum hooker,” he told Red Landyard.</p><p>“She’s had her name painted out about five </p><p>times. She’s no more’n eight hundred tons, </p><p>if she’s that. She’s a broodin’ menace ov </p><p>some kind. Ah wash my hands of this </p><p>voyage.” </p><p> “You’re ’ands need washin’!” snapped</p><p>Micky McMasters. “Drop below and look </p><p>over the engines. See hif there’s any coal </p><p>or supplies aboard. Report to me on the </p><p>bridge.” </p><p> “D’ye call that a bridge?” Mike pointed</p><p>forward of the tipsy funnel, which was </p><p>painted light blue. </p><p> “Hit’s a better bridge than the mud flats</p><p>of Novgorod!” Micky said. “Get below </p><p>and report. I’m skipper ’ere!” </p><p>MIKE’S report, delivered between </p><p>clamps upon a chew of Chinese to- </p><p>bacco borrowed from a coolie, was </p><p>tense and bitter. </p><p> “Ye hae no conception of the state of</p><p>things below,” he told Micky McMasters. </p><p>“There’s only one double-door boiler. It </p><p>was made in Canton—China. The engines </p><p>are cross-compound of the vintage of Isaac </p><p>Watt and Robert Fulton. The coal is Jap- </p><p>anese—twa bunkers of it. The stoke-hold </p><p>leaks and the shaft-alley is full of bilge </p><p>muck. Ah saw the stuffin’-boxes jettin’ </p><p>water myself. The last engineer of this </p><p>packet wrote wot he thought of it on the </p><p>ditty-box door. He said enough. His </p><p>name was MacFarland.” </p><p> “What’s that got to do with hus?”</p><p> Mike walked from starboard to port of</p><p>the tramp. He stared down at the fine of </p><p>coolies who were staggering aboard under </p><p>the last of the boxes. He watched the yel- </p><p>low hands of the gang in the fore-hold reach </p><p>for the cargo. He came back to Micky </p><p>McMasters. </p><p>54 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Wot’s it got to do with us?” he re-</p><p>peated. “It’s got a lot. Ah doot if we </p><p>make Japan—let alone Victoria.” </p><p> “We’ll try,” said Micky sadly. “The</p><p>Russian says we can clear at nightfall. 'E </p><p>and ’is crew are coming aboard then. I </p><p>tested the steering-gear. It works. Who </p><p>got steam up?” </p><p> “Three coolies who are sittin’ in the en-</p><p>gine-room waiting to go ashore. Ah bor- </p><p>rowed some cut-plug from them—enough to </p><p>last the voyage—if it lasts. They can’t talk </p><p>anything but pidgin English. Their clothes </p><p>are not worth taking—or I’d of taken </p><p>them.” </p><p> Micky McMasters rubbed a bristly chin</p><p>reflectively. He stared at Mike Monkey’s </p><p>faded outfit. He swung his gaze to where </p><p>Red Landyard stood on the forecastle deck, </p><p>directing a gang of coolies who were clearing </p><p>away wreckage which had fallen about the </p><p>capstan. </p><p> “This Russian,” he said with an anxious</p><p>dance at the dark outlines of the shore, </p><p>this man who hired us at a thousand </p><p>rubles a week is some kind of a big labor </p><p>captain or prince. The coolies salute him. </p><p>The two Tatars standing guard at that shed </p><p>ashore bowed when he spoke to them. </p><p>There’s a whackin’ mystery ’ere!” </p><p> “Ah thought ye would get yer foot in it</p><p>when ah saw ye chinnin’ with that Russian </p><p>on the mud flat. He is a smuggler!” </p><p> “No! ’E don’t look like one.”</p><p> “Looks is only skin deep. He ought to</p><p>be skinned—with his thousand rubles a </p><p>week.” </p><p> “ ’E ’as nobody to navigate the ship, and</p><p>the tea ’as got to be taken hover the western </p><p>Pacific.” </p><p> “Tay? Ye are daft? D’ye call that</p><p>tay?” </p><p> Mike Monkey pointed a scornful finger</p><p>at the boxes piled around the fore-hatch. </p><p>He spat to the bridge-deck.</p><p> “That ain’t tay! That’s opium or hashish</p><p>or fireworks of some sort. Ah never saw </p><p>tay boxes with Russian letters on them.” </p><p>“There is good tea grown in some parts of </p><p>Russia.” </p><p> “It’s grown! Aye, it’s grown! Wot’s to</p><p>prove this cargo growed there. It may </p><p>have been brought to this cove in a sampan </p><p>—it may have been brought in a Chinese </p><p>junk—it may have-” </p><p> “ ’Vast with your ‘may-have’s!’ Get be-</p><p>low to the boiler! ’Ere comes a caravan or </p><p>a funeral. They’re Russians of the prov- </p><p>ince of the Don. See their beards and </p><p>their robes. There’s the big fellow who </p><p>hired us. 'E’s a bloomin’ juke, that’s wot </p><p>’e is! Kow-tow when ’e comes aboard.” </p><p>“Ye told me to go below.” </p><p> “’Urry hup! Never mind the kowtowin’.</p><p>You walk straight and take my orders until </p><p>we get on the ’igh seas.” </p><p> The first engineer fluttered a pair of pale</p><p>lashes in the general direction of the squad </p><p>of Russians who were winding around the </p><p>shore shed. He climbed down the rusty </p><p>bridge-ladder and glided for the engine-room </p><p>companion. He went through the single </p><p>grating and thrust his hands into the broken </p><p>pockets of his dungaree trousers as he eyed </p><p>the three coolies sitting on the crank-shaft </p><p>of the cross-compound engine. </p><p> “On deck!” he roared at the chinamen.</p><p>“Ye all get on deck, and don’t show yer mis- </p><p>erable faces here again. Ye’re discharged! </p><p>Ye built my fires in Oriental fashion—up- </p><p>side down with all the Japanese coal on the </p><p>grates. Ye left me nothing but clinkers and </p><p>salt water in the boiler and leaking gaskets </p><p>and-” </p><p> The last yellow man stared down through</p><p>the grating on his way to the deck and </p><p>departure. </p><p> “Plenty much you learn by and by.” he</p><p>said softly—too softly. “Plenty much-” </p><p> Mike picked up a rusty spanner. He had</p><p>drawn this back when there sounded the</p><p>raucous clang of an ancient gong in the </p><p>engine-room. Micky McMasters, wasting </p><p>no time, had rung for quarter-speed for- </p><p>ward before the Russian crew were well </p><p>aboard. </p><p> Two men came down the engine-room</p><p>ladder in awkward fashion. They blinked </p><p>at Mike. They stared at the engine as if it </p><p>were an idol in a temple. They stroked </p><p>their whiskers. </p><p> “Are ye coal-passers?” asked Mike.</p><p> “Passengers.”</p><p> “Wot?”</p><p> “We are passengers.”</p><p> “Ah asked ye if ye are coal-passers?”</p><p>Mike Monkey pointed toward the low </p><p>door through the bulkhead which separated </p><p>the engine-room from the stoke-hold. </p><p> “Get forrard!” he rasped. “D’ye know</p><p>the skipper rang for a turn on the engines? </p><p>D’ye know there’s only thirty pounds ov </p><p>steam?” </p><p> The Russians moved toward the stoke-</p><p>Assignats </p><p>55 </p><p>hold door. Mike picked up his spanner and </p><p>followed them. He spent the next lurid </p><p>hour breaking in two green firemen whose </p><p>manners were sullen and morose. </p><p>IT WAS after sundown when the </p><p>Shongpong clamped from her an- </p><p>chorage in the cove and started </p><p>eastward over the polished waters of the </p><p>Japan Sea. </p><p> A tan-colored moon hung in the sky. A</p><p>soft breeze swung out from Manchuria. </p><p>The powdered stars spangled the velvet </p><p>dome of heaven. </p><p> Red Landyard, Micky Masters and Mike</p><p>Monkey came together on the decrepit </p><p>bridge of the freighter like three men mak- </p><p>ing a common report. </p><p> Ivan with the long surname and most of</p><p>his following were in the lighted cabin </p><p>where rose the quarter-deck of the freighter. </p><p>A lone lookout stood on the forecastle head. </p><p>He was smoking a long-stemmed pipe. The </p><p>ashes from the bowl of this pipe made tinder </p><p>of his whiskers. Now and then he pressed </p><p>out the sparks and swore in Russian. </p><p> A second and sinister figure squatted on</p><p>the fore-hatch. He had a rifle across his </p><p>knees. The end of this rifle was tipped </p><p>with a polished bayonet. </p><p> “Standin’ guard,” said Micky McMas-</p><p>per. “The grand juke put ’im there to </p><p>watch the tea.” </p><p> “Tay!” said Mike Monkey. “Ye still in-</p><p>sist it is tay?” </p><p> Micky squared his jaw. “I know noth-</p><p>ing,” he said, “save that we are ’oldin’ a </p><p>course for ’Akodate and the Inland Sea, </p><p>which we should reach this time day after </p><p>tomorrow—if the steam don’t die out alto- </p><p>gether.” </p><p> Red Landyard stared at the Russian on</p><p>the fore-hatch. He eyed the bright point </p><p>of the steel bayonet. </p><p> “They’re quiet now,” he drawled, “but</p><p>we’re hardly out of sight of land. I expect</p><p>I’ll have to chain a man or two before long. </p><p>The forecastle is a volcano. Hear them </p><p>talking? They’re arguing some point in </p><p>Russian.” </p><p> Micky swung and eyed the break of the</p><p>quarter-deck, which showed four lighted </p><p>port-holes within the smudge of smoke that </p><p>draped from the tipsy funnel. </p><p> “They’re doing the same aft,” he said.</p><p>“Ivan, the grand juke, is leadin’ in the </p><p>prayin’ or whatever it is. I never saw such </p><p>a crew for talking. I don’t know who are </p><p>passengers and who are workin’ the ship. </p><p>I wish I’d studied Russian.” </p><p> “Wot good would that do?” asked Mike</p><p>Monkey. “They wouldn’t reveal their se- </p><p>cret plans to us.; Wot did they bring the </p><p>rifle aboard for? Wot’s to prove we ain’t </p><p>shipmates with a howlin’ bunch of anar- </p><p>chists? They’re quiet now. Them twa in </p><p>the stoke-hold only look at me and chew on </p><p>their beards when Ah give orders. They’re </p><p>waitin’ for somethin’!” </p><p> Micky strode across the bridge. He</p><p>gazed sadly at the ripples that curved from </p><p>the Shongpong’s straight bow. He esti- </p><p>mated the speed of the ship to be not more </p><p>than seven knots an hour. There was no </p><p>bridge-rail log.	*</p><p> He came back to Mike Monkey and Red</p><p>Landyard. </p><p> “Briefly stated,” ye said, “we’re in the</p><p>’ands of Providence. Anything is likely to </p><p>’appen with all that talking fore and aft. </p><p>The course the grand juke gave me is to the.. </p><p>Pacific—by the nearest strait. I’m ’olding </p><p>that course. That’s all I know. I ’ave a </p><p>wife and children at ’ome. I was thinkin’ </p><p>of them when I took the contract to work </p><p>this ship to Victoria.” </p><p> Mike studied the little skipper’s dungaree</p><p>jacket and unshaven face. </p><p> “How many Russians are there aboard?”</p><p>he asked. </p><p> “Sixty or seventy.”</p><p> “Then Ah resign if it comes to blows. Ah</p><p>am weak from starving on„the beach of </p><p>Novgorod. All Ah have been able to find to </p><p>eat on this hooker is caviar and salt fish. </p><p>Ah would as soon eat clinkers.” </p><p> A door slid open aft. A rolling voice</p><p>struck forward. Ivan appeared, followed by </p><p>two Russians. They were wrapped to the </p><p>beards in great coats trimmed with fur. </p><p>They climbed the bridge-ladder and stared </p><p>at the binnacle. </p><p> “East she is,” said Micky. “East, a</p><p>quarter point north.” </p><p> Ivan swept the sea with a long glance.</p><p>He nodded and pointed over the freighter’s </p><p>stumpy jib-boom. </p><p> “Japan lays there?” he questioned Micky.</p><p> “Yes. Habout four ’undred miles.”</p><p> “Have you sighted any ships?”</p><p> “None, yet.”</p><p> “If you do call me on deck. Answer no</p><p>signals. Keep the Chinese flag flying.” </p><p>“The Union Jack would look better!” </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Ivan stroked his beard.</p><p> “You take my orders,” he said icily.</p><p>“Avoid any suggestions. Keep away from </p><p>smoke, sails and particularly gunboats of </p><p>foreign powers. I’ll double the thousand </p><p>rubles which I have agreed to give you three </p><p>officers. I'll increase it to two thousand </p><p>rubles a week.” </p><p> Mike gulped and drew his scrawny neck</p><p>deep into his collar. He waited until Ivan </p><p>and the Russians had descended tbe bridge- </p><p>ladder and walked slowly aft to where the </p><p>light streamed from the open cabin door. </p><p> “Ye heard that!" grated the engineer with</p><p>scorn. “Ah thought it was possible to get a </p><p>thousand rubles a week. Ah expect noth- </p><p>ing now. It's too good to be true. All </p><p>minds the lilqss o’ that Russian! It was in </p><p>Guatemala where I was paid three thousand </p><p>pesos a month. The pesos were worth six- </p><p>pence on the pound.” </p><p> Micky McMasters shook his head.</p><p>“Anyway,” he said, “we’re on the first leg </p><p>’ome to blighty. We’re gettin’ a free pass- </p><p>age. That's something!” </p><p> Mike Monkey went below to the clanking</p><p>engines. Red Landvard stared forward and </p><p>aft. He entered the chart-house and turned </p><p>in across the single seaweed mattress it </p><p>contained. </p><p> Micky stood the watch until midnight.</p><p>He woke the Yankee mate, gave the course </p><p>and dropped down into the engine-room. </p><p>He sat with Mike until two bells. The </p><p>Scotch-Irish engineer was bitter against the </p><p>Russians. He rose now and then and </p><p>peered through the stoke-hold door, where a </p><p>lurid light glowed. </p><p> “Twa stokers,” he said, “and no fire to</p><p>speak of.” </p><p> Micky glanced around in caution as the</p><p>engineer came back for the third time. </p><p> “Investigate the fore-hold,” he whispered.</p><p>“Find out what is in those tea boxes. Don't </p><p>let anybody see you doing it. There’s a </p><p>plot of some kind aboard this ship.” </p><p> “They’ve talked enough for a revolu-</p><p>tion.” </p><p> The little skipper paused on the first</p><p>round of the engine-room grating. </p><p> “Get forrard when you can,” he whis-</p><p>pered. “Open one of those boxes.” </p><p> Mike gulped and nodded. He drowsed</p><p>out the morning hours and climbed to the </p><p>deck at the first crack of dawn. He waited </p><p>all the day for a chance to creep through the </p><p>stoke-hold without being detected by the </p><p>two Russian stokers. A second night came </p><p>and after night the twinkling lights of the </p><p>Inland Sea. No chance afforded itself in </p><p>the passage between the Japanese Islands. </p><p> It was morning of the third day when</p><p>Ivan with the long surname dashed thoughts </p><p>of a discovery in the forehold by summon- </p><p>ing all hands to the waist of the Shongpong. </p><p>A WILD seascape greeted Mike’s </p><p>eyes as he hurried up the engine-' </p><p>room ladder and braced his spindle </p><p>legs athwart the planks. </p><p> The duskv outlines of the Japanese Coast</p><p>were fast fading in the west. The wind </p><p>swung out of a biting north. The sea had </p><p>been stirred by the tail of a storm. The </p><p>dingy freighter, with her tipsy funnel and </p><p>standing rigging, rolled and tossed. She </p><p>threatened to have the two masts out of her </p><p>at any moment. </p><p> Micky McMaster stood the bridge with</p><p>Red Landvard. Ivan and all of the Rus- </p><p>sians, including the crowd from the fore- </p><p>castle, were gathered beneath the shelter of </p><p>the quarter-deck’s lift. They glanced at </p><p>Mike Monkey and started chattering in </p><p>Russian. His eyes lifted over their heads. </p><p>He gulped and moved his Adam’s apple up </p><p>and down his scrawny throat. He spat to </p><p>the deck. </p><p> The Chinese flag which had been flying</p><p>from the jack staff had been replaced by a </p><p>red oblong. It showed baleful in the rays </p><p>of the sun. </p><p> Mike turned his chin. He looked at</p><p>Micky. The little skipper's jaw was square </p><p>set. His shoulders were thrown back. </p><p>There was a fighting fire in his eyes.</p><p> “Wot happened?” asked Mike shrilly.</p><p> “Our friends are in charge of the ship,”</p><p>said Micky over the bridge-rail. “Come up </p><p>’ere! They’re going to take a vote for cap- </p><p>tain, mate and engineer. They say all </p><p>things in their government should be settled </p><p>by a vote. They’re going to elect a citizen </p><p>captain.” </p><p> “Wot is their government?”</p><p> Micky gripped the rail.</p><p> “Bolshevik!” he snapped.</p><p> Mike steadied himself on the wet planks.</p><p>He spat to the deck for a second time. His </p><p>glance ranged from the little -skipper to </p><p>Ivan’s broad face. </p><p> “Ah thought so!” he rasped. “We’re de-</p><p>luded men!” </p><p> Ivan strode from the press of Russians</p><p>Assignats </p><p>57 </p><p>beneath the break of the quarter-deck. </p><p>He mounted the main-hatch. His voice </p><p>rose and fell with the whine of the north </p><p>wind. He spoke in gusty torrents. He </p><p>pointed to the red flag aft. He turned and </p><p>leveled an accusing finger at the bridge </p><p>where Red Landyard and Micky stood with </p><p>folded arms. </p><p> Mike squinted at the half-circle of Rus-</p><p>sians. They were being worked up to a </p><p>storm by their leader. A fur cap was </p><p>passed. Into this was dropped slips of pa- </p><p>per upon which were scrawled names. A </p><p>rifle’s bayonet lifted above the heads of the </p><p>Bolsheviki. A club swung. </p><p> Mike leaped for the bridge-ladder and</p><p>climbed to the bridge like a frightened ape. </p><p>He worked his lashless brows up and down. </p><p>He spat through yellow teeth: </p><p> “Wot’s the answer? Wot happened?”</p><p>Micky McMasters sighed. He thrust his </p><p>hands in his pockets resignedly. </p><p> “Hit’s hall hup!” he declared. “They’re</p><p>electing a citizen captain to take my place. </p><p>They’re voting for an engineer and mate. </p><p>They say there should be equality on the sea </p><p>as well as on the land. ’Ere comes hour </p><p>substitutes!” </p><p> Mike glared at three Russians who had</p><p>detached themselves from the others. One </p><p>was a former coal-passer. Another had </p><p>come aft from the forecastle. Ivan made </p><p>the third. </p><p> The Russian stood beneath the rocking</p><p>bridge and said sternly: </p><p> “You mutineers get below to the stoke-</p><p>hold. We will guide the Shongpong out </p><p>across the Pacific. We will make our own </p><p>report without your aid. We need you on </p><p>deck no longer.” </p><p> Red Landyard snatched up a belaying-</p><p>pin from the lee rail. </p><p> “--you!” he shouted. “I signed on</p><p>as mate—and I'll be mate!” </p><p> “And I’m captain!” shrieked Micky.</p><p> The fight which followed was all one-</p><p>sided. A hoarse command from Ivan was </p><p>answered by a determined rush forward. </p><p>The Bolshevik horde swarmed over the </p><p>bridge of the wallowing freighter. Micky </p><p>and Red Landyard fought them tooth and </p><p>nail. They swung belaying-pins and a </p><p>chart-case. They finished their end of the </p><p>struggle upon their knees—to which posi- </p><p>tion they were beaten by the press of num- </p><p>bers. </p><p> Mike, considering discretion the better</p><p>part of valor,, managed to creep along the </p><p>weather rail and spring for the engine-room </p><p>companion. He sprawled down the ladder </p><p>head foremost. He rebounded at the grat- </p><p>ing. He snatched up a spanner and glared </p><p>upward. He braced a foot in the pit, out of </p><p>which flashed the slow-moving cranks of the </p><p>cross-compound engines. </p><p> His chin described a quarter-circle. The</p><p>companion-way was darkened by the form </p><p>of a man. Micky, still fighting, dropped </p><p>down and struck the grating. Red Land- </p><p>yard was hurled after the little skipper. </p><p>Both seamen had been shorn of. most of </p><p>their clothes. Their faces were bleeding. </p><p>Welts showed upon their shoulders. </p><p> “Gorblvme!” cried Micky. “Gorblyme</p><p>—give me a hose! Give me hot water! </p><p>Give me steam!” </p><p> “Go easy,” drawled the Yankee mate,</p><p>squinting at the whiskered faces which </p><p>blocked the entire companion. “There's a </p><p>few of them left. We didn’t kill them all.” </p><p>“We ought to!" spat Micky. “Bolshe&gt;— </p><p>viki? They’re red-’andcd murderers—that’s </p><p>wot they are!” </p><p> “That’s my opinion,” said Mike Monkey.</p><p>“You? You!” sputtered Micky. “Where </p><p>were you when the fight started?” </p><p> “Ah came down here for a pinch bar. Ah</p><p>was just going up when ye joined me—pre- </p><p>cipitously.” </p><p> Micky rubbed his bleeding knuckles. He</p><p>turned a cold shoulder upon the engineer, </p><p>then stared upward. He made faces at the </p><p>Bolsheviki and shook his broken right fist.</p><p> “I’ll ’avc you know there’s a law on the</p><p>seas!” he snapped. “I’ll report this outrage </p><p>to the next British consul.” </p><p> Ivan pushed away the men about the</p><p>companion. He descended two rungs of </p><p>the iron ladder, turned and sneered into the </p><p>gloom of the engine-room. </p><p> “You are to remain below.” he said coldly.</p><p>“Get steam up and give us full speed. You </p><p>will be thrown overboard if you do not </p><p>obey my orders. The citizen captain so </p><p>directs me.” </p><p> “Where’s me twa thousand rubles?”</p><p>shouted Mike Monkey. “Coom down here </p><p>—ye scum of the steepies! Coom down!” </p><p>Ivan started descending. He thought </p><p>better of the action when Mike snatched up </p><p>an iron bar and brandished it with agility. </p><p> “Coom down, ye Bolshevik dog! Coom</p><p>down if ye dare!” </p><p> Ivan called in Russian. A ferocious face</p><p>5» </p><p>Adventure </p><p>appeared over the edge of the companion. </p><p>The sharp point of a bayonet extended into </p><p>plain view. The muzzle of the rifle de- </p><p>flected until it was directly aimed at Mike. </p><p> He dropped the iron bar to the grating.</p><p>He held up his hands. </p><p> “That let’s me out!” he cried through</p><p>chattering teeth. “Don’t shoot!” </p><p> “Go forward,” Ivan ordered. “You and</p><p>the American go forward and put coal on the </p><p>fires. You, McMasters, attend to the en- </p><p>gines. None of you three men will be al- </p><p>lowed on deck. You will all be shot if you </p><p>do not keep the ship moving at full speed. </p><p>Those are die orders of the citizen captain.” </p><p>Micky picked up an oil can. He squirted </p><p>a stream at the nearest crank. </p><p> “Steam on the engine!” he said to Mike</p><p>and Red. </p><p> The two castaways went through the</p><p>stoke-hold doorway. The shovels grated on </p><p>the iron apron before the double fire-boxes. </p><p>A biting Scotch oath rolled into the engine- </p><p>room. Micky eyed the steam-gage on the </p><p>main steam pipe. It was climbing. He </p><p>glanced upward. The ferocious Russian </p><p>was standing guard with the rifle. Ivan had </p><p>disappeared. </p><p>DAYS passed in unending drudg- </p><p>ery. Food was lowered down at </p><p>the end of a line. The sentry was </p><p>changed each watch. Ivan kept away from </p><p>the companion, though his voice was </p><p>heard in loud argument concerning the posi- </p><p>tion of the freighter. Micky, stripped to his </p><p>sweating waist and smarting from the blows </p><p>he had received, grinned through the </p><p>knuckle-thick bristle on his lips. </p><p> He kept the engines oiled. He saw to it</p><p>that the throttle-wheel was wide open. </p><p>Once he relieved Mike at passing coal. The </p><p>ship made progress of a kind. It was evi- </p><p>dent that the citizen captain had headed for </p><p>the center of the north Pacific. There was </p><p>little danger of a lee shore. </p><p> “And may he wander like the Flyin’</p><p>Dutchman!” said Mike Monkey on*the six-</p><p>teenth day. “Ah hope he’s lost.” </p><p> “No,” said Red Landyard, “he’s heading</p><p>somewhere. The course is always east. I </p><p>can tell by the sun. He hasn’t changed a </p><p>quarter point.” </p><p> Micky McMasters glared at his two</p><p>mates. They resembled stokers of Hades. </p><p>Their skin was blistered. The callouses on </p><p>their hands had become small cushions. </p><p>The fighting fire in their eyes alone remained </p><p>to remind the little cockney skipper what </p><p>manner of men they were and had been. </p><p> “The plot,” said Micky, “is thick and ’ard</p><p>to fathom. For why are they ’eadin’ to the </p><p>States or Canada? No one wants them </p><p>over there. They’ll run their bloody ’eads </p><p>hinto a noose.” </p><p> Mike Monkey cocked a grease-lined ear.</p><p>He blinked. </p><p> “Ye hear them chatterin’?” he asked.</p><p>“They’re sea lawyers! Ah hae hopes they </p><p>start to massacre themselves.” </p><p>Micky rubbed the bristles on his chin. </p><p>“We’ll reach land in a day or two,” he </p><p>said. “Then we’ll find out the answer for </p><p>the boxes of tea and the voyage and the </p><p>other questions.” </p><p> “Tay!” exclaimed Mike. “Ye always</p><p>said it was tay. This looks like a tay party. </p><p>It—it-” </p><p> The Scotch-Irish engineer’s statement was</p><p>broken by the appearance of Ivan’s bulky </p><p>form in the companion. The Russian came </p><p>down to the grating. The sentry pointed </p><p>the rifle at the group. Mike dodged be- </p><p>neath the forward bulkhead door and waited </p><p>there with bent head. </p><p> “McMasters!” called Ivan. “Come here,</p><p>McMasters!” </p><p> Micky folded his arms across his hairy</p><p>breast and stared at the Russian. </p><p> “What d’you want?” he asked.</p><p> Ivan peered through the engine-room</p><p>gloom.</p><p> “We have decided,” he said heavily, “that</p><p>you can join us as a brother. We have </p><p>voted on it. We will make you rich. You </p><p>can be one of us.” </p><p> “I’d rather be a dirty stoker than one of</p><p>your breed!” replied Micky. </p><p> “We are going to give you a chance.</p><p>You can help us navigate to our port of call. </p><p>The citizen captain is not sure of his exact </p><p>position. Assist us to obtain a reading and </p><p>we will honor you by admission to the Be- </p><p>nevolent Order of Reds. We intend to raise </p><p>one billion dollars in Canada and the United </p><p>States. We shall give you a share in it.” </p><p> “To - with you and your billion!”</p><p>Micky screamed, brandishing a broken fist. </p><p>“Get hout of the gangway!” </p><p> “Ye did right,” whispered Mike as Ivan</p><p>climbed hurriedly through the engine-room </p><p>companion and disappeared on deck. “Ye </p><p>were not to be bribed by the scum o’ Russia. </p><p>Wot’s the answer to the billion dollars?” </p><p>Assignats </p><p>59 </p><p> Micky stared at the point of the bayonet</p><p>which crossed the sky over his head. He </p><p>glanced at the flashing cranks of the cross- </p><p>compound engines. He raised his voice </p><p>above the noise of their wallowing passage. </p><p> “The answer is this!” he snapped.</p><p>“They’re going to Victoria and Canada to </p><p>raise a revolution. There are a lot of Bol- </p><p>sheviki in ’iding—from Victoria to the At- </p><p>lantic seaboard. This is a plot to start </p><p>somethin’ against law and order. I’ll </p><p>smash that big grand juke with a ’ammer </p><p>the next time ’e talks to me. ‘E’s insulted </p><p>a British seaman—’e ’as!” </p><p> Mike shot a crafty glance at the stoke-</p><p>hold door. He scratched his greasy neck. </p><p> “A plot?” he said. “Ah hae noo doot we</p><p>can nip it in the bud. All we got to do is to </p><p>open the bilge-cocks and drown the rats.” </p><p>“And we go down with them?” </p><p> “Aye!”</p><p> Micky shook his head.</p><p> “We’re not martyrs,” he suggested cut-</p><p>tingly. “There may be a better way to get </p><p>rid of the scum of Siberia.” </p><p> “Set the hooker on fire?”</p><p> “We’ll roast with it!”</p><p> “Ah’ll think it over, then.”</p><p> Mike Monkey disappeared through the</p><p>bulkhead door. Micky watched the en- </p><p>gines for a long minute. He raised his eyes </p><p>and saw a shadow cross the companion </p><p>opening. A second bayonet joined the first. </p><p>Ivan had posted two guards to watch the </p><p>three men between decks. The big Rus- </p><p>sian also signaled for more speed. He was </p><p>answered by oaths from Mike Monkey and </p><p>Red Landyard. </p><p>A LONG, hot day passed. The </p><p>heat of the stoke-hold and engine- </p><p>room was a tiling to remember. </p><p>The three castaways sweated beneath the </p><p>menace of the two bayonets and Ivan’s bru- </p><p>tal oaths. The sounds from the deck were</p><p>those of a madhouse. It was evident that </p><p>the citizen captain did not know his position </p><p>on the ocean. Once the Shongpong headed </p><p>due south. Her course was changed to </p><p>northeast. She steadied and clamped on- </p><p>ward, holding an uncertain path. </p><p> Night brought some relief from the heat.</p><p>The Japan current was swinging along the </p><p>American shore. A breeze sprang up. The </p><p>ship rolled. Lurid oaths from the Russians </p><p>came down the rusty ventilators. This was </p><p>music to the castaways’ ears. </p><p> Midnight and eight bells brought diver-</p><p>sion. Running feet sounded on the ship’s </p><p>planks. A muffled cannon-shot echoed </p><p>from the distance. A shell burst over the </p><p>freighter’s rigging. </p><p> Clanging bells for more speed drove</p><p>Micky from the engine-room into the stoke- </p><p>hold. </p><p> “A gunboat!” lie exclaimed. “We’re be-</p><p>ing chased!” </p><p> “Ah thought we would be!” rasped Mike</p><p>Monkey. “Shall Ah draw the fires?” </p><p> The engineer’s question was answered by</p><p>a curdling oath from Ivan. The leader of </p><p>the Bolsehviki descended to the stoke-hold </p><p>door. He peered through the gloom. </p><p> “You heard the bells!” he snarled through</p><p>his beard. “You all die if you don’t keep up </p><p>steam. We’re going to escape from the </p><p>cutter. Fortunately it is an old one.” </p><p> Micky McMasters shook his head toward</p><p>his two mates. He followed the Russian </p><p>into the engine-room and picked up an oil- </p><p>can as Ivan motioned for the sentries to get </p><p>on deck. A silence fell upon the brooding </p><p>ocean. </p><p> Red Landyard appeared between the</p><p>stoke-hold and the engine-room. He braced </p><p>his legs and toyed with a short iron bar. </p><p>Now and then he stared forward to where </p><p>the crimson light glowed from the fire doors. </p><p>The steam mounted in the gages. Mike </p><p>Monkey worked alone. The Scotch-Irish </p><p>engineer had evolved an idea out of the sit- </p><p>uation. He had sent Red to the stoke-hold </p><p>door in order to stand guard. </p><p> “What is ’e doing?” asked Micky in a</p><p>whisper. </p><p> “Sist!" said the Yankee. “Pretend to oil</p><p>the engines and keep busy. Don’t let the </p><p>sentries suspect anything. Watch the steam. </p><p>It’s going up to the bursting point.” </p><p> Micky watched the gage on the main</p><p>steam leader. It started climbing from </p><p>one hundred and seventy to one hundred </p><p>and ninety. It went over the two hundred </p><p>mark. It dropped and mounted again. </p><p> The little cockney skipper heard the fire</p><p>doors clanging. A baleful light streamed </p><p>past Red Landyard. A roar sounded in the </p><p>single funnel. It was as if the ship were </p><p>equipped with a double-fan forced draft. </p><p>The cross-compound engine spun like a </p><p>turbine. </p><p> “What's ’e putting on the fires?” ques-</p><p>tioned Micky. </p><p> “The tea!”</p><p>6o </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “The what?”</p><p> “The boxes of tea in the forehold,”,</p><p>husked Red. “We broke through and </p><p>looked the Bolshevik cargo over. It’s com- </p><p>bustible all right.” </p><p> “TNT?”</p><p> “Nope! Look out! That sentry is cock-</p><p>ing his gun. Duck aft. Don’t let him see </p><p>you talking with me.” </p><p> Micky crawled down the narrow shaft-</p><p>alley. He sat on the thrust block and </p><p>searched his heated brain for an answer to </p><p>Mike’s energy. Hours later he heard the </p><p>scraping of rocks and shale under the </p><p>Shongpong’s keel. The ship heeled and </p><p>plunged on. Her bow crashed upon a </p><p>shelving beach. The Bolsheviki cursed. A </p><p>mast went by the board. It splintered the </p><p>deck. The funnel fell with its load of soot. </p><p>The engine-room filled with choking smoke. </p><p> Mike Monkey burst through this pall.</p><p>He started mounting the ladder to the com- </p><p>panion. Red and Micky followed the en- </p><p>gineer. They stood on deck and ranged </p><p>their smarting eyes over a desperate scene. </p><p> The citizen captain of the Shongpong had</p><p>found his port of call—a wooded cove on </p><p>Vancouver Island. In his zeal at the dis- </p><p>covery of the rendezvous he had neglected </p><p>to stop the ship. The freighter lay with a </p><p>seven-degree list to starboard. Her deck </p><p>was a mass of wreckage from fallen standing </p><p>rigging, mast and funnel. Above this m£lee </p><p>of twisted lines and back-stays and smoking </p><p>ventilators, towered Ivan of the long sur- </p><p>name, his great spade-shaped beard lifted on </p><p>high. </p><p> His followers swarmed around him on the</p><p>tottering bridge. A red light showed </p><p>through the tall stems of fir-trees. This </p><p>liglit moved as a signal. A score of furtive </p><p>shadows flitted in the underbrush at the </p><p>head of the cove. Russian faces stared out </p><p>over the shoal waters of the rendezvous. A </p><p>shout of brotherhood passed between ship </p><p>and shore. </p><p> “Coom on,” whispered Mike Monkey to</p><p>Micky and the Yankee seaman. “Coom </p><p>aft. They’re too busy forrard to notice us. </p><p>We’ll lower the dingey and escapc.” </p><p> The cockney skipper climbed over the</p><p>deserted quarter-deck and loosened the </p><p>falls. He dropped the bow of the small </p><p>boat into the waves that curled astern of </p><p>the grounded freighter. Red Landyard </p><p>lowered the after part of the dingey. The </p><p>three castaways found oars. They rowed </p><p>for a dark cape that struck out into the </p><p>cove. They gained the beach of this point </p><p>and staggered ashore. They turned and </p><p>stared at the canted freighter. </p><p> “See,” said Mike Monkey. “They’re</p><p>opening the fore-hold. Ah wish them luck </p><p>in wot they find beneath the hatch.” </p><p> Micky squinted through the gloom. He</p><p>discerned dancing figures on the deck of the </p><p>Shongpong. A bloodthirsty yell of baffled </p><p>rage rose to the western stars. It was </p><p>echoed by the conspirators ashore. </p><p> “Ah hae noo doot,” Mike Monkey rasped,</p><p>“they found ah had burned all the tay. </p><p>Didn’t Old Whiskers ask us to keep the fires </p><p>burning hot and nice? Ah kept them burn- </p><p>ing—at a price. Ah put all of the tay boxes </p><p>through the fire doors. There’s none left.” </p><p>“What was in them?” asked Micky. </p><p>Mike closed a lashless eyelid. He drew a </p><p>greasy handful of papers from beneath his </p><p>shirt. He offered them to the little skipper. </p><p> “Rubles!” he said. “Bolshevik bonds</p><p>and rubles! They were bringing them to </p><p>Canada and the States. Ah hae an idea </p><p>they were going to sell them to the Reds in </p><p>both countries. All ah know to be sure is— </p><p>there ain’t no rubles left. Ah found them </p><p>better to burn than the miserable slag called </p><p>Japanese coal.” </p><p> Micky saw a light. He squareset his un-</p><p>shaven chin and pointed south along the </p><p>coast. </p><p> “We’ll walk the beach,” he said, “until we</p><p>come to a coast guard. No doubt the cut- </p><p>ter that chased the Bolsheviki is nosin’ </p><p>around. We’ll show it where to go.” </p><p> Mike thrust his ruble notes back within</p><p>his shirt. </p><p> “Ah’ll keep these!” he declared. “They</p><p>ain’t worth a ha’penny, but they’re what we </p><p>can expect to get for wages if the Reds start </p><p>runnin’ the governments.” </p><p>JEST JIM, FIDDLIN’ J/M </p><p>Hapsburg </p><p>Lieoe </p><p>Author of “The Lavender Letter,” “Godfather to Satan's Kitchen," ek. </p><p>yE SAT before a brushwood fire in </p><p>the mildewed stone fireplace of a </p><p>moss-covered old cabin low on </p><p>the breast of Big Blue Smoky. </p><p>Night had fallen; a chilling Summer thun- </p><p>derstorm was just passing the crest of its </p><p>fury. He was alone and lonesome; he had </p><p>made the fire for light, for comfort, for com- </p><p>panionship—all three. On his knee lay a </p><p>battered brown violin, and in his right hand </p><p>he held motionless a homemade sourwood </p><p>bow. His topaz eyes were fastened on the </p><p>glowing coals; there he saw a picture of a </p><p>slender young woman, barefooted and </p><p>dressed in a simple garment of calico, whose </p><p>leaf-brown hair hung in a single plait. </p><p> There came a keen clap of thunder, like a</p><p>farewell message of defiance from the pass- </p><p>ing storm, and “Fiddlin’ Jim” straight- </p><p>ened, smiled a little and lifted his fiddle to </p><p>his chin. He started to play, more or less </p><p>imperfectly, Schubert’s incomparable “Sere- </p><p>nade,” which he had learned from the prison </p><p>chaplain's phonograph, when his born- </p><p>woodsman’s eyes fell upon a tiling that he </p><p>had not before noticed. It was a tiling the </p><p>average person would never have noticed. </p><p> One of the worn, flat stones of the mil-</p><p>dewed hearth had recently been moved. </p><p> Jim Braden put his fiddle down and knelt</p><p>at the hearth. Another momen t and he had </p><p>taken out the loose stone; still another mo- </p><p>ment and he held in his two hands a wallet </p><p>of black leather which contained nearly two </p><p>thousand dollars in paper money of half a </p><p>dozen denominations. It represented more </p><p>than a fortune to Fiddlin’ Jim. He stared </p><p>at it in amazement; then he laughed softly </p><p>to himself. He closed the wallet and thrust </p><p>it into a rear pocket of his trousers, replaced </p><p>the stone, sat down on the soap-box chair </p><p>that was the only bit of furniture the old </p><p>cabin had and took up liis beloved fiddle. </p><p> BEFORE he could lay bow to</p><p>fstr&gt;ngj however, the door creaked </p><p>open on its wooden hinges and he </p><p>half turned his head to see a slip of a bare-</p><p>footed boy standing on the threshold, his </p><p>clothing soaking wet and dripping, his slight </p><p>body shaking from the chill. </p><p> “Whatever on earth!” cried Jim Braden.</p><p> Quickly but with a great tenderness he put</p><p>the battered brown violin on the floor close </p><p>beside the soap-box chair. </p><p> “Come on in, son! Come up to the fire!</p><p>My heavens, but it shorely is cold here on </p><p>Big Blue Smoky, even in the Summer-time, </p><p>a follerin’ one o’ these lightnin’ starms!” </p><p> He threw more brushwood to the flames,</p><p>which licked hungrily at the fresh fuel. </p><p> The boy advanced gingerly, stopped at the</p><p>edge of the hearth and soberly looked the </p><p>other over from head to foot. He saw a </p><p>man of not more than thirty-four, a tall, </p><p>straight, muscular man whose features were </p><p>strikingly rugged and strong and yet kindly, </p><p>whose eyes were unmistakably those of a </p><p>dreamer of dreams. </p><p> The man saw in the lad a good deal of</p><p>himself. The small new-comer had a deter- </p><p>mined mouth and chin, and his eyes, too, </p><p>were those of one who knew both the build- </p><p>ing and the destroying of castles in the air. </p><p>62 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>He was sunburnt and freckled, and his hair </p><p>was of the yellowish-white color that is the </p><p>result of living in the open without a hat. </p><p> Fiddlin’ Jim did not strive to connect</p><p>the presence of the boy with the money he </p><p>had just uncovered. He rose, went to the </p><p>door and closed it, took off his old, wrinkled, </p><p>moth-eaten coat, returned to the fire and sat </p><p>down. </p><p> “Shed them wet clo’es, son,” he drawled</p><p>good-naturedly, “and put on this whilst </p><p>ye’re a waitin’ fo’ ye clo’es to dry.” </p><p> He held the coat out to the fire to warm it.</p><p>The boy eyed him stolidly and silently for a </p><p>long minute; then he turned his back to Jim </p><p>Braden, unbuttoned a few buttons and let </p><p>his faded waist and short jeans trousers fall </p><p>to the floor. He looked a slim, beautiful, </p><p>pale bronze statue of enviable youth. Jim </p><p>Braden draped the little figure with his coat, </p><p>turned its face toward him and buttoned the </p><p>garment all the way. The boy smiled </p><p>faintly in his gratitude to the good Samari- </p><p>tan, spread his wet clothing out in order </p><p>that it would dry quicker and sat down on </p><p>the hearth. </p><p> “I’m much obleeged to ye, shore,” he</p><p>said finally. “I got lost in the starm and I </p><p>seed the light. I hope ye don’t mind it </p><p>about me a cornin’ in, mister.” </p><p> “Sartinly not,” declared Fiddlin’ Jim.</p><p>“It ain’t my cabin, nohow. It ain’t no- </p><p>body’s in pa’tickler, I reckon. I jest </p><p>stopped in here a hour or so ago. I’m plum’ </p><p>glad to see ye, son. I was mighty lonesome! </p><p>Most o’ folks ’pears to be afeard o’ me ’cause </p><p>I’ve been to the penitenchy. I never killed </p><p>nobody, son, honest I never. I got ketched </p><p>in a sort o’ net, son. I stayed fo’ twelve </p><p>years. The gov’nor, he pardoned me or I </p><p>might ha’ had to stay fo’ life, ef I’d ha’ </p><p>lived that long.” </p><p> “I’m sorry fo’ ye, mister,” said the Jad.</p><p>“Thankee! But I shore l’arned somethin’ </p><p>in the penitenchy; I made the most of it, </p><p>shore,” Fiddlin’ Jim continued with unusual </p><p>garrulousness. “The chaplain—it was him, </p><p>I reckon, that reelly got the gov’nor to par- </p><p>don me—the chaplain, he said I’d l’arned to</p><p>look up, fo’ one thing.” </p><p> “Look up?” wondered the lad, drawing</p><p>the coat closer about his bare legs. “How </p><p>do ye mean, look up?” </p><p> “Why, to see where the acorns comes</p><p>from,” laughed Fiddlin’ Jim, “acorns, the </p><p>manna o’ the hawg! A hawg never looks </p><p>up, son; it hunts fo’ acorns under a syca- </p><p>more tree or a poplar tree the same as it </p><p>does under a oak. A hawg don’t look up to </p><p>see the sun shine, neither. Also, I l’amed </p><p>to be glad I’m a-livin’. New gold money </p><p>ain’t any brighter’n life is to me, wi’ all I’ve </p><p>bore. I shorely don’t know why I’m a </p><p>talkin’ thisaway to you, son. I reckon I </p><p>was so full of it, I jest had to say it. I’d ha’ </p><p>said it to myself, mebbe, ef you hadn’t ha’ </p><p>come in to hear it. </p><p> “Now s’posen ye tells me a little about</p><p>yeself, son, eh? I like ye, m’boy; somehow </p><p>ye ’minds me o’ somebody I’ve knowed </p><p>somewhere, sometime. Well, come along </p><p>wi’ ye tale, buddy-boy; I’m a listenin’. </p><p>Tell me whose boy ye are and would ye </p><p>ruther be a senator, a congressman, or a </p><p>good fiddler when ye’ve growed up to be a </p><p>man?” </p><p> The lad looked at Braden solemnly.</p><p> “I’d ruther be,” he said quite earnestly,</p><p>“a good fiddler, and I’m Lot Hupple’s boy.” </p><p>Fiddlin’ Jim’s face showed a big, new </p><p>interest. </p><p> “The one,” he asked, “which used to be</p><p>called ‘Bad Lot?’ Which used to wear ring- </p><p>lets on his forrard jest to make people laugh </p><p>at him so’s he could pick a quick fight the </p><p>easier? Big as a skinned hoss and not </p><p>afeard o’ the devil on Friday?” </p><p> “That’s him,” said Lot Hupple’s boy.</p><p>“He still wears them ringlets and he still </p><p>fights, and they still calls him ‘Bad Lot.’ I </p><p>reckon he is a bad lot! The’ ain’t nobody </p><p>that can whip him, everybody says. He </p><p>whipped a whole loggin’ outfit oncet—sup’- </p><p>rintendent and all. My name is ‘Little </p><p>Jim’ Braden.” </p><p> “Little Jim Braden!” exploded big Jim</p><p>Braden. “What—how—how come it Lot </p><p>named ye that, son?”</p><p> “Dunno ’zackly. But I think he used to</p><p>have a friend named Jim Braden, mebbe. </p><p>What’s yore name, mister?” </p><p> “Me?”</p><p> Fiddlin’ Jim was again staring at a picture</p><p>in the glowing coals. He saw the slender, </p><p>barefooted young woman in calico; he saw </p><p>himself; he saw Lot Hupple, his friend; and </p><p>he saw Dana, the young woman, turn from </p><p>Hupple and go with him. Following this, </p><p>there came the officers, the accusation, trial </p><p>by judge and jury, and, finally, imprison- </p><p>ment—all within a few months after his </p><p>marriage to Dana. </p><p> “My name,” he drawled absently, “is jest</p><p>Jim, Fiddlin’ Jim.” Then he asked: “What </p><p>Jest Jim, Fiddlin’ Jim </p><p>63 </p><p>was ye mother’s name, son, and is she yit a- </p><p>livin’?” </p><p> “Dana, and she’s yit a-livin’.”</p><p> “Dana?”</p><p> Fiddlin’ Jim sat stiffly upright on the</p><p>soap-box chair. He had never known an- </p><p>other Dana. Then he believed he under- </p><p>stood. His wife had married Bad Lot </p><p>Hupple, his friend, after the cataclysm. </p><p>Bad Lot had thought enough of him, Jim </p><p>Braden, to name his son for him. It was </p><p>good of Hupple to do it. </p><p> He had heard, in prison ten years before,</p><p>that Dana was dead. Somebody, he didn't </p><p>remember who, had written the chaplain to </p><p>that effect, and the chaplain had told him. </p><p>He hadn’t known how to read and write, and </p><p>neither had Dana. No message, therefore, </p><p>had passed between them after his being </p><p>sent to the State’s prison. The fact that </p><p>she was still living and married to Lot </p><p>Hupple—he hadn't the least doubt of it— </p><p>came as a very great surprize to him, and he </p><p>was so intensely human that he hardly </p><p>knew, at the first, whether to be sorry or </p><p>glad. </p><p> But when a full realization of the thing</p><p>had broken upon him, he “looked up,” as </p><p>the chaplain had taught him, and was glad. </p><p>ONCE more the cabin door creaked </p><p>suddenly open, and there stepped </p><p>across the rotting sill a big man, a </p><p>Goliath of a man, smooth-faced and sun- </p><p>burnt almost to the hue of weathered cop- </p><p>per. He wore ill arranged and straggling </p><p>jet-black ringlets of hair on his forehead, </p><p>and his countenance branded him as one </p><p>most sorely distraught. Fiddlin’ Jim recog- </p><p>nized him immediately, rose and went to- </p><p>ard him with outstretched hand. </p><p> “H’lo, Lot!” he cricd. “Shorely am glad</p><p>to see ye, old friend!” </p><p> Hupple had recognized Braden before en-</p><p>tering the cabin; otherwise he would not </p><p>have entered. He took Braden's hand and </p><p>pressed it half reluctantly, then dropped it. </p><p> “What’s the matter wi’ ye, Lot?” smiled</p><p>Fiddlin’ Jim. “How come it ye’re so pest- </p><p>ered in ye mind, old friend?” </p><p> Bad Lot. the Goliath, didn’t answer. He</p><p>took two short, staggering steps backward, </p><p>as do dark villains of the footlights'. Jim </p><p>Braden went on: </p><p> “Ye shorely ain’t drunk, Lot?” He was</p><p>still smiling; his topaz eyes were sparkling </p><p>in the firelight. “Didn’t ye know it’s as </p><p>much fun to play off drunk as it is to ack- </p><p>shully be drunk, and a feller don’t have no </p><p>habbergosh taste in his mouth nor no head- </p><p>ache in his head the next mornin’! Honest, </p><p>what’s wrong, old friend?” </p><p> “It’s the law, Fiddlin’!” Hupple ex-</p><p>claimed, his voice hoarse and a little shaken. </p><p>“I’m in a mess. I-” </p><p> He broke off and turned toward the open-</p><p>mouthed boy on the hearth. </p><p> “What’re you a-doin' yere, Little Jim?”</p><p>he demanded. </p><p> The answer came quietly, readily:</p><p>“Mother sent me to look ye up, pap. She </p><p>said to tell ye Bill Freer and three other </p><p>men is a-watchin’ the house, and fo’ you not </p><p>to come home ontel she gi’ ye a sign by </p><p>hangin’ a white cloth on the cedar in the </p><p>front yard where she usually hangs the </p><p>wash.” </p><p> Bad Lot clenched his hands and swore</p><p>under his breath. He looked toward the </p><p>now deeply concerned face of Fiddlin’ Jim. </p><p>“Tell me about it, Bad,” Braden urged. </p><p>Hupple turned to the sober-eyed Little </p><p>Jim. He did not notice that the lad wore </p><p>Fiddlin’ Jim’s old coat; Braden and the lad, </p><p>themselves, had forgotten it for the moment. </p><p> “Son,” said Hupple, “sneak down to the</p><p>creek that runs jest below here and ye’ll find </p><p>a path a-takin’ square out to the left, along </p><p>the bank. Put ye feet in that path and </p><p>i t'll carry ye home. Tell ye mother I onder- </p><p>stand. Hurry up, son!” </p><p> The boy rose and slipped obediently into</p><p>the night. Bad Lot crumpled to the soap- </p><p>box chair.</p><p> “I didn't want him to hear, Fiddlin’,”</p><p>Hupple began. “I’m a-goin’ to tell ye </p><p>everything, Fiddlin’. It was thisawav: </p><p>“You know how it alius was wi’ me. I </p><p>was borned onder a bad star, seems like. </p><p>When anything bad was done, it was alius </p><p>blamed on me. Well, when you was took </p><p>to the penitench, 1 thought ve’d never </p><p>come back, and Dana, she didn’t think ye’d </p><p>ever come back. I got sorry fo’ her, a- </p><p>seein’ her work so hard to make a livin’— </p><p>you know Dana well enough to know she </p><p>wouldn’t never be nobody’s cook, nor </p><p>sponge offen nobody. I ailus loved her, </p><p>which same ye also know. You a bein’ took </p><p>to the pen gi’ her a divo’ce, natchelly. I </p><p>begged her to marry me and le’ me do the </p><p>work fo’ us, and she fin’lly done it. It was </p><p>most—mostly ’cause I was yore friend, </p><p>Fiddlin’, that she married me. </p><p>64 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Well, you know how it is when a man’s</p><p>repitation is bad. It’s awful easy to hang </p><p>any sort o’ crime on his head, and a man has </p><p>to pull a crooked deal sometimes to git his </p><p>due. To come to the kyernel o’ the mat- </p><p>ter, Fiddlin’, I was ’cused o’ shootin’ and </p><p>robbin’ a cattle-buyer who’d started out wi’ </p><p>a fat pocketbook, only yeste’day. The’s a </p><p>pow’ful heap o’ evidence that I done it; in </p><p>fact, the’s a plenty to send me up. Sheriff </p><p>Bill Freer and three o’ his depities rid out </p><p>after me this mornin’, but I got away. </p><p>They’re still a-chasin’ me, Fiddlin’, and I </p><p>shore don’t know what I’m a-goin’ to do!” </p><p>“And—and Dana?” Jim Braden mut- </p><p>tered. </p><p> “Dana!” cried Bad Lot Hupple. “It’s a</p><p>worryin’ her to death!” </p><p> Fiddlin’ Jim rubbed his chin thought-</p><p>fully, bent his head, folded his arms and </p><p>began to pace the floor. “It’s a-worryin’ </p><p>her to death!” still rang in his ears. It must </p><p>be true, he reasoned. A woman like Dana </p><p>wouldn’t live with a man for so long if she </p><p>didn’t love him. </p><p> After some two minutes of thinking,</p><p>Braden drew up before Hupple, who now sat </p><p>with his face buried in his hands. </p><p> “Ye did rob the cattle-buyer, Bad,” said</p><p>he, “and ye brung the money here and hid </p><p>it in the hearth.” </p><p> Rupple gave no sign that he had heard,</p><p>but he had. Inwardly he winced. </p><p> “Ye did rob the cattle-buyer, Bad,” re-</p><p>peated Jim Braden. </p><p> Bad Lot straightened on the soap-box.</p><p> “I ain’t said I didn’t, did I? Ain’t a</p><p>man got to have his due for a bein’ blamed </p><p>wi’ everything?” </p><p> “We’ll not argify the p’int,” said Fiddlin’</p><p>Jim. “Listen here, Bad. Are ye plum’ </p><p>shore it’s a-worryin’ Dana thataway? Are </p><p>ye shore she loves ye, Bad? We’ve alius </p><p>been friends, Bad, and ye cain’t tell me </p><p>nothin’ but the truth; rickollect that.” </p><p>Hupple looked the fiddler squarely in the</p><p>eye. It was one of his own particular </p><p>long suits, looking people squarely in the </p><p>eye. </p><p> “You know Dana,” said he. “Do ye</p><p>think she’d live wi’ me fo’ ten years ef she </p><p>didn’t love me? Answer me that, Fiddlin’?” </p><p>It was along the line of Braden’s own rea- </p><p>soning. Braden nodded. He was satis- </p><p>fied. He leaned slightly forward and put a </p><p>hand on Hupple’s shoulder. </p><p> “Would ye be willin’ to lead a straight</p><p>life from now on, old friend,” he asked, “ef </p><p>ye was only out o’ this scrape?” </p><p> “But who could git me out o’ this scrape,</p><p>Fiddlin’?” </p><p> “Me, Bad Lot, mebbe.”</p><p> “But how could ye do it?”</p><p> “I don’t know, jest yit. Howsomever,</p><p>the’s a way, Bad; the’s got to be a way. </p><p>It’s fo’ the sake o’ Dana and the boy as </p><p>well as fo’ you, and it’s got to be done. </p><p>Promise me faithful to square up, old </p><p>friend; that’s all ye’ve got to do, that and ye </p><p>must stay hid fo’ a week or so, ontel I can </p><p>shift the blame. Are ye a-promisin’ me </p><p>faithful, Bad?” </p><p> “Am I?”</p><p> Hupple went to his feet. He seized</p><p>Fiddlin’ Jim’s hand and wrung it and gave </p><p>his word with a rather fearful oath. </p><p> JUST then there came a tiny noise</p><p>from the darkness outside; it was </p><p>“* the breaking of a wet bit of rotting </p><p>wood. Jim Braden snatched up the boy’s </p><p>sodden clothing and flung it over the bed of </p><p>coals in the fireplace, plunging the interior of </p><p>the cabin into total darkness. Another </p><p>second and the door creaked on its wooden </p><p>hinges, and the blinding white rays of an </p><p>electric flashlight fell full on Fiddlin’ Jim’s </p><p>startled countenance. </p><p> “Up with ’em—quick!” boomed the voice</p><p>of Sheriff Bill Freer. “Grab the roof, Lot, </p><p>grab ’er!” </p><p> Braden put up his hands. A deputy</p><p>slipped from the darkness and snapped</p><p>manacles over Braden’s wrists. </p><p> “Search him!” ordered Freer.</p><p> The deputy obeyed with alacrity. He,</p><p>found the cattle-buyer’s wallet in Fiddlin’ </p><p>Jim’s pocket and tossed it to the sheriff’s </p><p>feet. Fiddlin’ Jim looked to his right and </p><p>to his left. Bad Lot was not in the cabin. </p><p>Then Braden’s gaze fell upon the one win- </p><p>dow, and he knew. Hupple had escaped. </p><p> “He ain’t got any gun,” said the deputy,</p><p>“and it ain’t Lot Hupple!” </p><p> “I see it ain’t,” Freer replied. “Pick up</p><p>that wallet and see if McAutry’s name is on </p><p>it.” </p><p> The deputy held the wallet to the light.</p><p>“Yes,” he nodded. “John B. McAutry. </p><p>It’s ffill o’ bank-notes.” </p><p> Freer stared hard at Jim Braden, whom</p><p>he had never seen before. </p><p> “How come you wi’ this, pardner?” he</p><p>asked gruffly. </p><p>Jest Jim, Fiddlin’ Jim </p><p>65 </p><p> Fiddlin’ Jim forced himself to smile.</p><p>For the sake of his friend, Dana and the </p><p>boy, he set his feet in the path of sacrifice. </p><p> “I reckon the game’s up fo’ me,” he said</p><p>slowly. “I reckon I might as well confess </p><p>and be done with it. I held up and robbed </p><p>John B. McAutry, but I didn’t mean to </p><p>shoot him, honest. The gun went off acci- </p><p>dent’ly, Mr. Sheriff.” </p><p> “What’s yore name, pardner?”</p><p> “Jim.”</p><p> “Jim what?”</p><p> “Jest Jim. Fiddlin’ Jim,” said Braden.</p><p>“The'rest don’t matter.” </p><p> Freer holstered his revolver, took the</p><p>John B. McAutry wallet from the hands of </p><p>his assistant, glanced into it and thrust it </p><p>into his pocket. Then he stepped heavily </p><p>toward his prisoner. The soap-box chair </p><p>was in his way; he kicked it aside. </p><p> “Look out!” Braden bellowed. “My</p><p>fiddle—don’t ye step on that fiddle!” </p><p> Immediately there was the crashing and</p><p>splintering of dry wood; the officer’s foot had </p><p>inadvertently demolished the battered but </p><p>much-loved old instrument. It put Fid- </p><p>dlin’ Jim clean beside himself; he sprang at </p><p>Freer like an enraged panther, his manacled </p><p>wrists notwithstanding, and drove a knee </p><p>hard to Freer’s stomach. There came a roar </p><p>from the revolver of the deputy, who didn’t </p><p>quite understand, and Jim Braden crumpled </p><p>to the floor across the poor remains of his </p><p>fiddle and lay there very still. </p><p> FIDDLIN’ JIM sat up and looked</p><p>$jp||| about him. It was daylight; it </p><p>was, in fact, around the middle of </p><p>the afternoon. He was in a perfectly spot- </p><p>less white bed. On the log walls of the </p><p>room hung pictures in homemade black- </p><p>walnut frames that seemed somehow fa- </p><p>miliar. At his right was a homemade table, </p><p>and on it were a broken vase filled with </p><p>mountain flowers and a very beautiful, </p><p>orange-colored violin. On the floor beside </p><p>the table sat a boy; he had a barlow knife</p><p>in his hand and he was busily making a </p><p>water flutter-wheel of old cornstalks. It </p><p>was little Jim Braden. </p><p> A door opened and a woman, half buxom</p><p>and pretty, but somewhat worn and anxious </p><p>looking, entered the room. It all seemed </p><p>queer. The woman saw that he was sitting </p><p>up, and she hurried to him. </p><p> “Jim,” she said eagerly, “how do ye feel</p><p>now?” </p><p>5 </p><p> He recognized her when she spoke. It</p><p>was Dana. She sat down on the side of his </p><p>bed and with a wonderfully gentle hand </p><p>touched the white bandage that was about </p><p>his temples. Yes, it was Dana, Lot Hup- </p><p>ple’s wife; he was a little dazed yet but he </p><p>knew that much. </p><p> “Where’s the sheriff?” he muttered.</p><p>“And what ’come o’ the irons that was on </p><p>my wrists?” </p><p> “Bill Freer’s gone back to the lowland,”</p><p>answered Dana and she smiled upon him. </p><p>“The’s nothin’ ag’in ye now, Jim. Bill </p><p>Freer said he was awful sorry he busted up </p><p>ye fiddle and he brung ye a new one. See it </p><p>there on the table?” </p><p> Braden nodded.</p><p> “Where’s Lot?”</p><p> “Dead.”</p><p> “Dead?”</p><p> “Dead—and buried.” Dana showed no</p><p>sign of grief. </p><p> “How come that?” asked Braden.</p><p> “Bill Freer had to shoot him in self-de-</p><p>fense. Freer didn’t believe it, when you </p><p>said it was you robbed John McAutry. </p><p>He went straight on after Lot, and he </p><p>got him afore dinner-time o’ the next </p><p>day.” </p><p> Fiddlin’ Jim bent his bandaged head and</p><p>tried hard to remember more clearly. </p><p> “How long have I been here, Dana?”</p><p>“More’n four days. The doctor said the </p><p>bullet broke the bone above ye left temple; </p><p>he said ye had brain fever or somethin’. </p><p>And he said ef ye come to, ye’d be might’ </p><p>nigh shore to make it; and ye have, Jim, </p><p>thank God!” </p><p> She choked. There was a little period of</p><p>silence. The boy dropped his barlow knife </p><p>and climbed to his knees at the bedside; he </p><p>watched his mother and big Jim Braden </p><p>wonderingly. Then Braden spoke again: </p><p>“So Lot’s cashed up. Pore old Lot! </p><p>Did ye love him, Dana?” </p><p> “No,” said Dana. “I told him I didn’t</p><p>and never would, when I married him. I </p><p>married him ’cause he was yore friend—that </p><p>is, I thought he was—and ’cause I couldn’t </p><p>make it a-workin’ by myself, and ’cause Lot </p><p>told me you had died in the penitenchy! </p><p>I’m sorry to haf to disapp’int ye in Lot, Jim, </p><p>but I’ve got to do it. </p><p> “Jim, Lot owned up to everything afore</p><p>he went; he seed he’d haf to’die. It was Lot </p><p>that done the killin’ that sent you to the </p><p>penitenchy, Jim. Him and Ben Rouse had </p><p>66 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>a fight, and he shot Ben. You, hot-headed- </p><p>like, had threatened to fix Ben, as ye’ll </p><p>rickollect, only the week afore. Lot hired </p><p>them two low-down Sellarses to swear they </p><p>seed you do it, and that and yore own foolish </p><p>threat sent ye up. It’s no trouble to put </p><p>Lot out o’ my mind, Jim. I ain’t never </p><p>loved nobody on earth, it seems like now, </p><p>but you—you and this here one baby o’ </p><p>mine which I named after you. He was </p><p>two years old when I married Lot Hupple. </p><p>He’s yore own boy, Jim.” </p><p> “My own boy!” gasped Braden.</p><p> “Take my word fo’ it,” begged Dana.</p><p>“Count up how old he is, and—and every- </p><p>thing. Jim, do ye want me back now?” </p><p>Fiddlin’ Jim turned his eyes, shining topaz </p><p>eyes, upward. His kindly, rugged face </p><p>seemed somehow glorified. Dana was afraid; </p><p>perhaps, she thought, it was his delirium </p><p>again. </p><p> “What is it, Jim, honey dahlin’?” she half</p><p>whispered, her voice that of the eternal </p><p>mother. “What is it ye see?” </p><p> “Nothin’ much,” smiled the man who had</p><p>learned fine lessons of life behind the iron </p><p>bars of a prison. “I was jest a-lookin’ up </p><p>to see where the acorns conies from.” </p><p> THE HAVEN</p><p>by BERTON BRALEY </p><p>(“Little Islands tucked away down under the Line.”—Kipling.) </p><p> THERE’S an Island somewhere down below the Line,</p><p>It’s an Island that I’ve never even seen, </p><p> Where the level beach is delicate and fine,</p><p>And the sea is like an opal, blue and green. </p><p>Oh, the long tides ebb and flow there and I’m simply sick to go there </p><p>Where the phosphorescent combers glow and shine, </p><p>And the cockatoos are screaming and the tropic stars are gleaming </p><p> On an Island somewhere down below the Line!</p><p> I am harnessed in the yoke of everyday;</p><p>I am fettered to the humdrum and the dull, </p><p> But my thoughts are always wandering away</p><p> On the highroad of the eagle and the gull.</p><p>Far away from care and canker there’s a dream ship drops her anchor </p><p> In a blue lagoon of coraline design,</p><p>And a slow tide gently heaves me and a dream boat takes and leaves me </p><p> On an Island somewhere down below the Line.</p><p>There I swing a golden hammock, and a breeze </p><p>Brings the heavy scent of jungle-growth and bloom, </p><p>And the coconuts are falling from the trees. </p><p>And I hear the far-off breakers roar and boom. </p><p>It’s a dream of drowsy beauty that is kept from me by duty; </p><p> It’s a glamour never, never to be mine,</p><p>But I still can hold the vision of a loafing-spot elysian </p><p>On an Island somewhere down below the Line! </p><p>SAID AFZEL’S </p><p> ELEPHANT</p><p>&amp; </p><p> H.A.Lamb</p><p>Author of “The Rider of the Gray Horse,” “The Skull of Shirzad Mir” etc. </p><p> Put cloth of gold upon a fool and a multitude will</p><p>do reverence to him; clothe a wise man in beggar’s </p><p>garments, and few will honor him. Yet those few </p><p>will have their reward.—Turkestan Proverb. </p><p>VE WERE three men with two </p><p>horses and two swords. We </p><p>were outcasts in the thickets </p><p>of the foot-hills of Badakshan, </p><p>under the peaks of the Roof of the World. </p><p>We had earned the wrath of the Mogul of </p><p>India and there were two thousand riders </p><p>searching for us. </p><p> It was the year of the Ox—the year 1608</p><p>by the Christian calendar—and Jani Beg, </p><p>the Uzbek, had taken Badakshan from my </p><p>lord, Baber Shirzad Mir, sometimes called </p><p>the Tiger Lord. </p><p> Nevertheless, we three were happy.</p><p>We had taken Shirzad Mir from the hands </p><p>of Jani Beg, who had marked him for death. </p><p> Aye, Shirzad Mir sat in the clean white</p><p>robes in which he had prepared to die by a </p><p>twisted bowstring around the neck, and </p><p>laughed for joy of seeing the sun cast its </p><p>level darts of light over the peaks and </p><p>through the trees that gave us shelter. </p><p>Our hearts—the Ferang’s and mine—were </p><p>lifted up for a moment by the warmth that </p><p>comes with early morning. We had an </p><p>ache in our bellies for lack of food; we had </p><p>not slept for a day and a night. Also, I was </p><p>stiff with many bruises. </p><p> “Tell me,” said Shirzad Mir, fingering</p><p>his full beard, which was half gray, half </p><p>black, “how you got me out of the prison </p><p>of Khanjut.” </p><p>While I watched, lying at the edge of </p><p>the thicket on my side, the Ferang—the </p><p>Englishman, Sir Ralph Weyand—explained </p><p>how we had climbed through the water </p><p>tunnel of Khanjut into the walls, and how </p><p>we two alone had freed the Mir while Jani </p><p>Beg and his men were tricked into looking </p><p>the other way by a herd of cattle that we</p><p>had sent to the gate of Khanjut. </p><p> He spoke in his broken Mogholi, but</p><p>Shirzad Mir, who was quick of wit, under- </p><p>stood. </p><p> “And whence came you?” he asked.</p><p> Sir Weyand told how he had been sent</p><p>to India as a merchant, and had been </p><p>driven from the court of the Mogul by the </p><p>wiles of the Portuguese priests. When he </p><p>had done, Shirzad Mir rose up and touched </p><p>his hand to earth, then pressed the back </p><p>of it to his brow. This is something he has </p><p>seldom done, being a chieftain by birth, </p><p>and a proud man. Sir Weyand rose also </p><p>and made salutation after the manner of his </p><p>country. </p><p> I watched from the comer of my eye,</p><p>for my curiosity was still great concerning </p><p>the Ferang: also, for all he had borne him- </p><p>self like a brave man that night, he was </p><p>but a merchant and I knew not how far </p><p>we could trust him. While I lay on the </p><p>earth and scanned the groups of horsemen </p><p>that scurried the plain below us, seeking </p><p>for our tracks, the thought came to me </p><p>that our fortunes were desperate. </p><p> We were alone. The followers of Shirzad</p><p>Mir were scattered through Badakshan, or </p><p>67 </p><p>68 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>slain. The family of my lord was in the </p><p>hands of Jani Beg—upon whom may the </p><p>curse of God fall. To the north of Badak- </p><p>shan we would find none but Usbeks, </p><p>enemies. To the east was the nest of bleak </p><p>mountains called by some the Hindu-Kush, </p><p>by others the Roof of the World. To the </p><p>west, the desert. </p><p> True, to the south, the Shyr Pass led</p><p>to the fertile plain of Kabul, but up this </p><p>pass was coming Said Afzel, the son of </p><p>Jani Beg, with a large caravan. I had </p><p>heard that Said Afzel was a poor warrior, </p><p>being a youth more fond of sporting with </p><p>the women of his harem and with poets, </p><p>than of handling a sword. Still, he had </p><p>followers with him, for he was bearing the </p><p>gifts of the Mogul Jahangir from Agra to </p><p>Jani Beg. </p><p> Something of this must also have been in</p><p>the mind of Shirzad Mir, who had been lord </p><p>of Badakshan for twice ten years, during </p><p>the reign in India of the Mogul Akbar— </p><p>peace be on his name! </p><p> “I am ruler,” he smiled sadly, “of naught</p><p>save two paces of forest land; my dress </p><p>of honor is a robe of death. For a court </p><p>I have but two friends.” </p><p> Shirzad Mir was a broad man with</p><p>kindly eyes and a full beard. He had </p><p>strength in his hands to break the ribs of a </p><p>man, and he could shoot an arrow with </p><p>wonderful skill. He was hasty of temper, </p><p>but generous and lacking suspicion. Be- </p><p>cause of this last, he had lost Badakshan </p><p>to Jani Beg, the Uzbek. </p><p> He knew only a little of writing and</p><p>music; still, he was a born leader of men, </p><p>perhaps because there was nothing he </p><p>ordered them to do that he would not do </p><p>himself. Wherefore, he had two saber cuts </p><p>on his head and a spear gash across the </p><p>ribs. </p><p> Thinking to comfort him, I rose up from</p><p>the place where I was watching and squatted </p><p>down by them. </p><p> “There are many in Badakshan,” I said—</p><p>long ago he had granted me leave to be</p><p>familiar with him—“who will come to you </p><p>when they know you are alive.” </p><p> “Who will tell them, Abdul Dost?” he</p><p>asked mildly. “We will be hunted through </p><p>the hills. The most part of the nobles of </p><p>Badakshan have joined the standard of </p><p>Jani Beg.” </p><p> “The men of the hills and the desert’s</p><p>edge are faithful, Shirzad Mir,” I said. </p><p> They were herdsmen and outlaws for</p><p>the most part. Our trained soldiers had </p><p>been slain, all but a few hiding out in the </p><p>hills. </p><p> “Aye,” he exclaimed, and his brown eyes</p><p>brightened. “Still, they are but men. </p><p>To take up arms against the Uzbeks we </p><p>need arms—also good horses, supplies and </p><p>treasure. Have we these?” </p><p>|^| SO WE talked together in low tones, </p><p>tf&amp;A thinking that the Ferang slept or </p><p>did not hear. Presently I learned </p><p>that he understood, for, with many pains, </p><p>he had taught himself our tongue. </p><p> We spoke of the position of Jani Beg.</p><p>Truly, it was a strong one. He himself </p><p>held Khanjut, which was the citadel at the </p><p>end of the Shyr ravine leading into India. </p><p>Paluwan Chan, leader of his Usbeks, was </p><p>at the great town of Balkh with a garrison. </p><p>Reinforcements were coming through the </p><p>passes to the north from Turkestan. Out- </p><p>posts were scattered through the plains. </p><p>Jani Beg was a shrewd commander. Only </p><p>once did I know him to err badly in his </p><p>plans. Of that I will tell in due time. </p><p> Shirzad Mir, who was brave to the point</p><p>of folly, said he would go somehow to Agra </p><p>and appeal for mercy from Jahangir himself. </p><p>I had been to Kabul and I knew that the </p><p>intrigues of Jani Beg had made his quarrel </p><p>seem that of the Mogul and—such is the </p><p>witchery of evil words—Shirzad Mir seem </p><p>to be a rebel. </p><p> “That may not be,” I answered.</p><p> Then the Ferang lifted his yellow head</p><p>and spoke in his deep voice. </p><p> “I heard at Agra, Shirzad Mir,” he said,</p><p>weighing his words, “that you were a</p><p>follower of the Mogul Akbar.” </p><p> “Of Akbar,” nodded my lord, “the</p><p>shadow of God and prince of princes. </p><p>He was a soldier among many.” </p><p> “So it has been told me.” Sir Weyand</p><p>rested his chin on his fists and stared up </p><p>where the blue sky of Badakshan showed </p><p>through the trees. “When Akbar was in </p><p>difficulty what plan did he follow?” </p><p> “He was a brave man. God put a plan</p><p>into his head when it was needed. He </p><p>had the wisdom of books and many ad- </p><p>visors.” </p><p> “And with this wisdom, I have heard</p><p>he always did one thing when he was pressed </p><p>by great numbers of enemies.” </p><p> Shirzad Mir looked thoughtfully at the</p><p>Said Afzel’s Elephant </p><p>69 </p><p> Ferang. It was a strange thing that this</p><p> merchant, who carried a straight sword and</p><p> came over the sea in a boat, should know</p><p> of the great Akbar. Verily, wisdom travels</p><p> hidden ways.</p><p> “Aye,” he said, “the Mogul Akbar would</p><p> say to his men that they should attack—</p><p> always attack.”</p><p> “Then,” repeated Sir Weyand promptly,</p><p> “we will attack. It is the best plan.”</p><p> I threw back my head and laughed.</p><p> How should the three of us, with but two</p><p> horses, ride against the army of Jani Beg?</p><p> How should we draw our reins against</p><p> Khan jut? We should be slain as a lamp is</p><p> blown out in the wind. A glance from</p><p> Shirzad Mir, who frowned, silenced, me</p><p> when I was about to put this thought into</p><p> speech.</p><p> “How?” he asked, still frowning.</p><p> Then I remembered that I also had asked</p><p> this question of the Ferang and that his</p><p> answer had freed Shirzad Mir. I drew</p><p> closer to listen.</p><p> “In my country,” said Sir Weyand,</p><p> “there is a saying that he who attacks is</p><p> twice armed.”</p><p> He then told how an ameer of Spain,</p><p> whose empire extended over Ferangistan</p><p> and the lands across the western ocean,</p><p> had sent a fleet of a thousand ships against</p><p> England in Sir Weyand’s youth; and how</p><p> the Queen of England had fitted out a</p><p> much smaller fleet, dispatching it to sail</p><p> against the invader.</p><p> “Had we waited for the Spaniards on</p><p> s land, the issue might have been different,”</p><p> he said. “As it was, few of the Dons</p><p> escaped with a whole skin. The advantages</p><p> of those attacking are these: they can</p><p> chose the ground best suited to them; they</p><p> can strike when they are ready; also, their</p><p> numbers appear greater in a charge or</p><p> onset.”</p><p> The thought came to me that perhaps</p><p> the Ferang, being a bold man, would not</p><p> hesitate to turn against us if the chance</p><p> offered. After all, he had been sent by</p><p> his king to get money and trade conces-</p><p> sions from India, and the small province</p><p> of Badakshan could mean little to him.</p><p> What did we know of the King of England—</p><p> except that he had ships and very fine</p><p> artillery?</p><p> Still, at this time Sir Weyand needed the</p><p> friendship of Shirzad Mir. And, although</p><p> he was a merchant—which is a getter of</p><p>money—he never in the weeks to come, </p><p>and I watched closely, shunned the dangers </p><p>we faced. Instead he welcomed a battle, </p><p>and laughed, when he swung his long sword, </p><p>as if he were about to go to a feast. It is </p><p>written that a fight is like a cup of strong </p><p>wine to some. Sir Weyand was such a </p><p>man. </p><p> “True,” nodded Shirzad Mir, who had</p><p>listened with care, “the great Mogul Akbar </p><p>once, when his men were wavering, went </p><p>forward on his elephant to a knoll where </p><p>all could see him; then he ordered his </p><p>attendants to shackle the legs of the ele- </p><p>phant with an iron chain so that he could </p><p>not retreat. Whereupon his men rode </p><p>forward, and the battle was won. Yet </p><p>we are only three against as many thou- </p><p>sands. In what quarter should we at- </p><p>tack?” </p><p> “Aye,” I put in, “where? We are not</p><p>yet mad.” </p><p> “We are like to be so from hunger or</p><p>thirst,” replied the Ferang, “if we do not </p><p>better our fortunes. I heard you say we </p><p>had no place to flee, and so we must at- </p><p>tack.” </p><p> “Khanjut?” smiled Shirzad Mir almost</p><p>mockingly. </p><p> But the Ferang was not in jest.</p><p> “If we had a few score followers, it would</p><p>not be a bad plan. But that is for you </p><p>to decide, Shirzad Mir. You know the </p><p>country. If I think of a plan, I will tell </p><p>you.” </p><p> That was all he had in his mind. I was</p><p>disappointed. Perhaps I had expected too </p><p>much of him.</p><p> “Meanwhile we must eat,” I pointed out,</p><p>feeling the urge in my stomach. “Iskander </p><p>Khan will surely give us food, also weapons, </p><p>if he has any.” </p><p> I did not add that my horse was at the</p><p>aul of Iskander Khan. Last night I had </p><p>ridden a wild ass from Khanjut. But I did </p><p>not want to do so again—until my bruises </p><p>healed. </p><p> “It is well,” said Shirzad Mir.</p><p> So he mounted one horse and the Ferang</p><p>the other. I trotted before them, to spy </p><p>out if the way was safe. Iskander Khan </p><p>was the friend who had aided us with his </p><p>herd of cattle and his two sons the night </p><p>before. His anl was hidden in the hills </p><p>not far away. But, as we traveled, we </p><p>did not think to find what was awaiting us </p><p>there. </p><p>70 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>II </p><p> ABOUT the time of noonday pray-</p><p>BjpP ers we came to the Kirghiz’ aul— </p><p>* three dome-shaped tents of willow </p><p>laths covered with greased felt and hides. </p><p>Over the opening of the biggest tent were </p><p>yaks’ tails, also an antelope’s head. Under </p><p>this sat Iskander Khan, cross-legged on the </p><p>ground. </p><p> He was a very old man, bent in the back,</p><p>with the broad forehead and keen eyes of his </p><p>race and a white beard that fell below his </p><p>chest. His eyes were very bright and his </p><p>skin had shriveled overnight. His turban </p><p>was disarranged as if he had torn it in </p><p>grief. </p><p> He rose unsteadily to his feet when he</p><p>saw Shirzad Mir. But my lord—because </p><p>Iskander Khan had rendered him a great </p><p>service, and because the Kirghiz was the </p><p>older man—sprang down from his horse </p><p>and went to meet him. Iskander-Khan </p><p>touched his hand to the earth and to his </p><p>forehead three times; then Shirzad Mir </p><p>embraced him. </p><p> “We have come for food,” I said, looking</p><p>for Wind-of-the-Hills, but seeing him not. </p><p> Iskander Khan lifted his hands in despair</p><p>and pointed to the empty huts. </p><p> “It is my sorrow,” he said, “that Shirzad</p><p>Mir of Badakshan should come to my aid </p><p>and ask meat when I have none to give. </p><p>There is kumiss in the cask, and this I will </p><p>bring you.” </p><p> He did so, filling a bowl with the mare’s</p><p>milk, which is the distilled drink of the </p><p>Kirghiz. Neither Shirzad Mir nor I liked </p><p>kumiss. When we saw how disappointed </p><p>Iskander Khan was at our refusal, we </p><p>forced ourselves to drink some. As it </p><p>happened, this was well, because the strong </p><p>fluid eased the pang in our insides. </p><p> Shirzad Mir glanced curiously about the</p><p>vacant aul. In the days when he had </p><p>known Iskander Khan, the Kirghiz had </p><p>many sheep and cattle. </p><p> Then Iskander Khan told us what had</p><p>happened. The herd and flock which </p><p>his sons had driven to the gate of Khanjut </p><p>had been taken by Jani Beg, who was </p><p>greatly angered at the trick we had played </p><p>on him. Also, the two boys and the </p><p>daughter of Iskander Khan had been taken </p><p>by the Uzbek horsemen. </p><p> One of the youths Jani Beg had impaled</p><p>on a spear which was then fastened to the </p><p>gate of Khanjut. The other Kirghiz had </p><p>been shot in the stomach with a matchlock </p><p>ball and thrown from the walls of the </p><p>citadel. </p><p> The girl Jani Beg had had flayed alive.</p><p>Iskander Khan had been too feeble to ride </p><p>with his sons. News of what happened </p><p>had been brought him by a Khirghiz sheep- </p><p>boy who saw. Truly, a heavy sorrow had </p><p>been laid on the khan for what he had done </p><p>for Shirzad Mir. </p><p> My lord put his hand on the arm of</p><p>Iskander Khan and spoke softly. </p><p> “It is written that what evil-doers store</p><p>up for themselves they shall taste. You </p><p>shall have revenge for the death of your </p><p>sons. By the beard of the prophet, I </p><p>swear it.” </p><p> He felt at the peak of his turban for the</p><p>jewel he had been accustomed to wear </p><p>there, intending to give it to Iskander Khan </p><p>as a token. He smiled ruefully when his </p><p>hand met naught but the cloth. The </p><p>small turban of white cotton he wore was </p><p>part of his grave clothes. </p><p> “Truly, Iskander Khan,” he meditated</p><p>aloud, “I am a beggared monarch. I have </p><p>not even a token to give you for this </p><p>service.” </p><p> “I am content, Shirzad Mir.”</p><p> I thought of the riches that the poet son</p><p>of Jani Beg was carrying to Khanjut from </p><p>the Mogul Jahangir, while Shirzad Mir </p><p>had not so much as a spare horse, and I </p><p>voiced this thought, being embittered by </p><p>hunger and much soreness. At this the </p><p>Ferang sprang to his feet so swiftly that I </p><p>thought he had seen some Uzbeks approach- </p><p>ing, so I did likewise. He clapped me on the</p><p>back, rudely. </p><p> “Ha, Abdul Dost!” he cried, “that is the</p><p>word I have been waiting for. So the </p><p>caravan of Said Afzel is now in the Shyr </p><p>Pass? Here is our chance. We will attack </p><p>Said Afzel!” </p><p> “Ride against two score, when we are</p><p>but three?” I laughed at the man. If he </p><p>was mad, I must see to it that Shirzad Mir </p><p>did not suffer from his folly. “I was in </p><p>Kabul three days ago, and Said Afzel was </p><p>just setting out. Besides his slaves and </p><p>personal servants he has a bodyguard of </p><p>some Pathans. They are well armed; the </p><p>pass is narrow. Also they have many </p><p>camels. You know not what you say!” </p><p>“Peace, Abdul Dost!” called my lord, </p><p>whose eyes had taken on a strange sparkle. </p><p>Said Afzel’s Elephant </p><p>71 </p><p>“You have not wit to see farther than your </p><p>horse’s ears. Let the Ferang speak!” </p><p> “It is better to be mad than calm at this</p><p>time when caution will gain us nothing, </p><p>excellency,” said Sir Weyand respectfully. </p><p>“Here is a noble chance. Said Afzel does </p><p>not yet know you have escaped. He will </p><p>not be watchful of danger. His caravan </p><p>may be numerous but it is made up for -the </p><p>most part of women and eunuchs. More- </p><p>over, in the narrow ravine they must </p><p>extend their line of march. We can choose </p><p>our place of attack-” </p><p> “And they will dig our graves there,”</p><p>I said. </p><p> Shirzad Mir frowned at me.</p><p> “And we will have the advantage of</p><p>surprize,” continued the Ferang. “Jani </p><p>Beg will hardly think to send reinforce- </p><p>ments to his son because he knows that </p><p>Said Afzel is well attended. We will have </p><p>time to gain the narrow point of the pass </p><p>just before dark—the best time to strike.” </p><p>“How can three horsemen ride against </p><p>camels and an elephant in a ravine?” I </p><p>asked, for I was not to be silenced. </p><p> Shirzad Mir was foolhardy of his life and</p><p>it was plain to me he liked well the words </p><p>of Sir Weyand. </p><p> “We will not ride against them, Abdul</p><p>Dost. If you had thought, you would re- </p><p>member that we could stand on the ridge </p><p>above the caravan trail, where our arrows </p><p>will command Said Afzel’s men.” </p><p> It was true I had not thought of that,</p><p>in my concern for Shirzad Mir. It angered </p><p>me—a mansabdar of the army—to be </p><p>corrected by a foreign merchant, and I was </p><p>silent for a space. Not so the Tiger Lord. </p><p> “Ilai—that was well said!” he cried.</p><p>“Such a plan warms my heart. Now if </p><p>we had the strong sons of Iskander </p><p>Khan—” he broke off with a glance at the </p><p>mourning Kirghiz. “What men and slaves </p><p>are with the caravan?” </p><p> “I heard at Kabul,” replied the Ferang,</p><p>settling his tall body against the tent, </p><p>“that Said Afzel was a courtier and a </p><p>gallant—fond of music, toys, verses and </p><p>the Indian dancing girls. He is bringing </p><p>a throng of such with him, also several </p><p>camel loads of treasure as gift from the </p><p>Mogul. What do we care for eunuchs and </p><p>Ethiopian slaves?” </p><p> “Said Afzel has at least seven Pathans</p><p>with him,” I reminded him. “They are </p><p>good fighters.” </p><p> “Are you an old nurse, Abdul Dost?”</p><p>cried my master in great anger. “Speak </p><p>again, and I will set you to tend swine!” </p><p>He turned to the Ferang. “Said Afzel </p><p>is truly called ‘the dreamer,’ Sir Weyand. </p><p>He is the most elegant in dress and can </p><p>recite verses as well as his boon companion </p><p>Kasim Kirlas, the professional courtier. </p><p>It is true that he travels with cumberous </p><p>baggage—unlike his father—and is usually </p><p>stupefied with bhang and opium. I would </p><p>risk much to set hand on his jewels.” </p><p> “We would risk much,” nodded the</p><p>Ferang bluntly, as was his custom; “espe- </p><p>cially as there is one of the big Indian ele- </p><p>phants in the caravan.” </p><p> “An elephant!” Shirzad Mir clapped his</p><p>stout hands and laughed. 11 Ilai—an ele- </p><p>phant. That would be Most Alast from </p><p>the stables of Jahangir. I heard it said </p><p>at Khanjut when I was prisoner. Verily, </p><p>the star of our good fortune is in the </p><p>ascendant.” </p><p> I thought the madness that had come</p><p>upon Sir Weyand had bitten my lord, </p><p>for he laughed again and fell to talking </p><p>in low tones to the other. I strained my </p><p>ears but could not hear. Being angry and </p><p>perhaps a little jealous, I withdrew slightly </p><p>to show them I did not care what they said. </p><p> Once Shirzad Mir called to Iskander</p><p>Khan. </p><p> “Have you a great cauldron?” he asked.</p><p>The Khirghiz pointed to the ashes of </p><p>the fire, where a pot stood, large enough to </p><p>boil a sheep whole. </p><p> “Will you give it me?”</p><p> Iskander Khan made a sign to show</p><p>that all he had was Shirzad Mir’s for the </p><p>asking. Once more the two talked together, </p><p>and I saw them glance at me and laugh. </p><p>Then Iskander Khan lifted up his white </p><p>head. </p><p> “You will need a good horse, Shirzad</p><p>Mir,” he said slowly. “The one you have </p><p>is a sorry pony. In a thicket yonder I have </p><p>Abdul Dost’s horse, also an Arab stallion </p><p>that has carried me for five years. I will </p><p>fetch it for you so that you may mount as is </p><p>fitting for a king.” </p><p> The eyes of the Tiger Lord softened.</p><p>“Thrice happy is the man who has a . </p><p>faithful friend,” he said and with his own </p><p>hand helped the aged Kirghiz to rise. </p><p> Before the two left the tent to go for the</p><p>horses, he spoke quickly to Sir Weyand. </p><p> The Ferang rose and stretched his big</p><p>72 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>frame. I did not move, for they had not </p><p>confided in me. He disappeared into the </p><p>tent and presently came forth, lugging a </p><p>basket filled with something heavy. I </p><p>wanted to see what was in it, but I would </p><p>not show him that I was curious. </p><p> He was singing to himself after his</p><p>strange fashion. He moved with his hands </p><p>that which was in the basket and put it in </p><p>the cauldron. I watched him. </p><p> When he had nearly finished there came</p><p>a dog that was hungry and whined. Seeing </p><p>the dog, Sir Weyand threw him a piece of </p><p>the stuff he was handling. The dog wagged </p><p>his tail and carried off the stuff. I saw him </p><p>eat it. </p><p> This was very strange, so I rose up with-</p><p>out seeming to be interested and walked </p><p>toward Sir Weyand, until I could see into </p><p>the pot. </p><p> B’illah!" I cried, for the stuff was rotting</p><p>swine’s flesh, which it is defilement for a </p><p>follower of the prophet to touch. It had </p><p>been used by Iskander Khan to grease the </p><p>tents. The Ferang, who knew this, laughed. </p><p> “Tell me, Abdul Dost,” he smiled, rising</p><p>from his lalx&gt;r when the pot was nearly full, </p><p>“is that dog better than you, or are you </p><p>better than that dog?” </p><p> He was a caphar, one without faith.</p><p>Those words might well have cost him his </p><p>life. </p><p> “If I have faith,” I answered him sternly,</p><p>“I am better than that dog; if I have not </p><p>faith, he is better than I.” I laid a hand </p><p>on my sword. “If you wish a quarrel-” </p><p> “Peace!” cried the voice of Shirzad Mir</p><p>behind us. “It is time we mounted.” </p><p> He was leading a fine gray stallion, and</p><p>Iskander Khan had Wind-of-the-Hills. </p><p>Likewise, the Kirghiz gave to us two good </p><p>bows and quivers full of arrows—also he </p><p>brought his own sword from the tent and </p><p>girded it on Shirzad Mir. What man could </p><p>do more than Iskander Khan did for us?</p><p> “The blessing of God go with you, Shirzad</p><p>Mir,” he said in parting. “I shall stay at </p><p>this tent, and perhaps-” </p><p> “I will come back,” said my lord swiftly.</p><p>“I will not forget.” </p><p> We watched the bent form of the old man</p><p>go into the empty tent; then we set spurs </p><p>to our mounts. The cauldron Sir Weyand </p><p>had slung on a long pole, one end of which </p><p>he carried and I the other. Shirzad Mir </p><p>rode bridle to bridle with him—I following </p><p>behind. Still they talked together eagerly, </p><p>like boys with a new sport. Once Sir </p><p>Weyand looked back at me and grinned. </p><p> “If you are afraid to come, Abdul Dost,”</p><p>he said, “you are free to drop the pole </p><p>and go.” </p><p> Before I could think of a fitting answer,</p><p>he was speaking again with Shirzad Mir. </p><p>Verily, I was angered. The pole leaped </p><p>and jumped, and I was forced to watch </p><p>lest the vile fat should fly out on me. </p><p>There was no doubt in my mind that lack </p><p>of food had unsettled my lord’s brain. </p><p> Why else should we ride at a fast trot</p><p>through the hot ravines of the hills to the </p><p>Shyr Pass, where at any moment we might </p><p>meet a wandering patrol on the watch for </p><p>us? And why did we carry that accursed </p><p>pig’s flesh? </p><p> As for Sir Weyand, my brain was black</p><p>with anger. I wanted to swing my scimitar </p><p>against his long sword. Had it not been </p><p>for the events of that evening, I should have </p><p>done so. </p><p> OUR horses were steaming when</p><p>we came out of a poplar thicket </p><p>“on a hill near the caravan track and </p><p>saw a boy shepherd watching us from his </p><p>flock. When he recognized Shirzad Mir, </p><p>the lad put down his bow and dropped to </p><p>his knees. </p><p> “Hazaret salametl” he cried joyfully, in</p><p>the dialect of his tribe. </p><p> He had thought Shirzad Mir was dead.</p><p>My lord questioned him swiftly. The boy</p><p>told him that the caravan of Said Afzel </p><p>had not yet passed this point. Our good </p><p>fortune still held, yet I was doubtful of </p><p>what was to come. Shirzad Mir bent over </p><p>the boy. </p><p> “Speak, little soldier,” he laughed, “how</p><p>would you like to shoot an arrow in the </p><p>service of your lord?” </p><p> The boy’s eyes brightened and he fingered</p><p>his bow, being both pleased and shy with </p><p>the attention paid him. He was a slight, </p><p>dark-skinned Kirghiz—the same that had </p><p>visited Iskander Khan’s aid—and the </p><p>words delighted him. Shirzad Mir honored </p><p>him by taking him up behind on his horse. </p><p>My belly yearned for the mutton that we </p><p>might have cooked and eaten, but my </p><p>master would not linger. </p><p> It was midafternoon, and the sun was</p><p>very hot. We were in the pass now, and </p><p>once we met a runner coming up the ravine. </p><p>It was a man of Said Afzel, and when he </p><p>Said Afzel’s Elephant </p><p>73 </p><p>saw us he bounded up into the rocks. But </p><p>Shirzad Mir fired an arrow swiftly. My </p><p>lord was an excellent shot. From the body </p><p>we took the message. </p><p> It said that Said Afzel would camp that</p><p>night at a certain level spot in the pass, </p><p>for the caravan track was too narrow, </p><p>besides being on the bank of the turbulent </p><p>stream Amu Daria, to travel at night. </p><p>Probably Said Afzel liked better to sit on </p><p>the cushions of a silk tent than to ride. </p><p> “God is good to us,” exclaimed Shirzad</p><p>Mir and pressed forward. </p><p> Although I still said nothing, I had a great</p><p>foreboding. No man has ever called me </p><p>a coward, but our strength was sapped by </p><p>hunger—we had no armor or firearms. We </p><p>were acting on the mad whim of the Ferang, </p><p>and for the first time in his life my master </p><p>had put aside my advice for another’s— </p><p>that of the merchant who made me carry </p><p>the pot of swine-flesh. </p><p> We passed the open place where Said</p><p>Afzel had planned to camp. We knew now </p><p>that the caravan could not be far away, </p><p>and Shirzad Mir sent the boy ahead to spy. </p><p>He ran swiftly, like a young mountain goat. </p><p> We came to the very place where I had</p><p>first met the Ferang, and I bent my ears </p><p>back like a horse, listening for hoofs on </p><p>the trail behind us, for here we were in a </p><p>trap. On one side the cliff rose sheer for </p><p>perhaps four spear lengths. On the left </p><p>hand the slope, steep and strewn with </p><p>rocks and thorns, dropped abruptly to the </p><p>rushing stream which was deep enough to </p><p>drown a man. </p><p> Truly, I thought, the madness of Sir</p><p>Weyand had brought us to an evil place. </p><p>If a patrol of Uzbek horsemen should come </p><p>behind us we would be caught between them </p><p>and the caravan. </p><p> Even a brave man feels a prickling of the</p><p>flesh when he knows not what is before and </p><p>behind him. The mad fantasy of the other </p><p>two had veiled their minds from danger. </p><p>Shirzad Mir, to make matters worse, set </p><p>Sir Weyand and me to rolling some stones</p><p>into the path from the slope. While we </p><p>were doing this he dismounted and led our </p><p>three horses by a roundabout path up to </p><p>the top of the cliff. </p><p> Not until we had the stone heap nearly</p><p>the height of a man and were panting from </p><p>the toil—my bruises had not yet healed— </p><p>did he call for us to cease. Then Sir </p><p>Weyand made me take the pole with him </p><p>and carry it up the slope to the top of the </p><p>cliff. If the foul fat had fallen back on me, </p><p>I should have struck him, but it was my </p><p>fate that it did not. </p><p> Back into a cedar grove we carried the</p><p>accursed thing. Here Shirzad Mir had </p><p>kindled a fire from dried cedar branches. </p><p> “The trees may hide the smoke,” he said.</p><p>“Quick—our time is little!” </p><p> As if possessed of a demon, Sir Weyand</p><p>worked at the fire, placing the cauldron </p><p>over the logs so that the fat began to heat. </p><p>Meanwhile, Shirzad Mir stood at the edge </p><p>of the cliff to watch for the coming of the </p><p>boy. </p><p> The sun had dropped behind the peaks at</p><p>our backs. There was no wind. The scent </p><p>of the cedars was sweet in my nostrils, but </p><p>Sir Weyand made me labor over the evil- </p><p>smelling pot. I had none of his wild hope. </p><p>For, without doubt, Said Afzel, whom we </p><p>sought, would ride the elephant, and I had </p><p>once tried to attack one of the beasts in a </p><p>battle. </p><p> The ravine in which the stream muttered</p><p>was clothed in shadows and it must have </p><p>been the time of sunset prayers when the </p><p>boy came running back up the path, looking </p><p>for us. </p><p> Shirzad Mir called to him, and the youth</p><p>came nimbly up the cliff, clinging somehow </p><p>to the sheer rock, until my lord reached </p><p>him a hand. Then he bowed his head to </p><p>Shirzad Mir’s feet. </p><p> “The caravan comes, Lord of Badakshan!”</p><p>he cried eloquently. </p><p> “How many and in what order?” asked</p><p>Shirzad Mir swiftly. </p><p> “Some horsemen, riding slowly, are in</p><p>front. Then a group of slaves with burdens </p><p>on foot. Following them some armed </p><p>riders. Then a black elephant with a </p><p>glittering howdah.” </p><p> “God is with us!” cried Shirzad Mir.</p><p>He turned to me merrily. “Ho—Abdul </p><p>Dost of the dark brow! What think you </p><p>of an elephant in the ravine of Shyr?” </p><p> We had seen none of the beasts in</p><p>Badakshan before, but something of Shirzad </p><p>Mir’s purpose flashed on me, and I felt the </p><p>heart-leap of the hunter when he sees game </p><p>approach his hiding-place. Sir Weyand </p><p>stirred the fat, which was now boiling and </p><p>bubbling odorously. </p><p> Above the place where we had piled the</p><p>stones so they would look as if they had </p><p>fallen down the slope, my lord sent the boy </p><p>74 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>with his arrows. He, himself, took his </p><p>bow and crawled forward to where he </p><p>could see him down the pass. </p><p> At a sign from Sir Weyand, I helped him</p><p>lift the cauldron from the fire by its stick. </p><p>We carried it to the edge of the ravine. </p><p> “Go with your master,” said Sir Weyand</p><p>to me under his breath, “and take your </p><p>bow. I will manage the rest of my task </p><p>alone.” </p><p> Nothing loath, I obeyed. Crouching</p><p>beside Shirzad Mir, I could see the caravan </p><p>coming up the pass, in the quiet of the </p><p>evening. The bearers and camelmen were </p><p>pushing ahead with loud cries, for the </p><p>camping-place.was just around a turn. </p><p>IT WAS a brave sight. The </p><p>Pathans, as the boy had said, were </p><p>in the lead—lean men, riding easily </p><p>and fully armed. Next came the Ethi- </p><p>opians, with their heavy burdens. They, </p><p>of course, were unarmed. I counted seven </p><p>Pathans. </p><p> Then appeared Most Alast, the elephant</p><p>of the Mogul. He had two red stripes </p><p>down his forehead, and silver bells at his </p><p>neck. I could see the white heron’s plume </p><p>of Said Afzel in the howdah behind the </p><p>mahout. Slowly, slowly, they came for- </p><p>ward. </p><p> “It could not be better, Abdul Dost,”</p><p>cried my master joyfully. </p><p> I took heart from this. For, though his</p><p>eyes were shining, he was laughing to him- </p><p>self, which was a good sign. He was not </p><p>mad. I. had begun to see his plan. </p><p> Last came the long-haired camels, bearing</p><p>the women, the baskets which probably </p><p>contained the treasure, and the eunuch </p><p>guards of the harem. A few slaves in </p><p>gorgeous tunics walked with the dirty </p><p>camelmen. </p><p> A lone Pathan brought up the rear. I</p><p>felt Shirzad Mir’s hand on my arm. </p><p> “Shoot your arrows among the camel-</p><p>men, Abdul Dost,” he said. “I will take </p><p>care of the leading riders—I and the boy. </p><p>When I shout, raise our battle-cry and </p><p>shout as if you were many men.” </p><p> I nodded to show that I understood. I</p><p>strung my bow and waited, lying on my </p><p>belly. It was just as if Shirzad Mir and </p><p>I were stalking antelope. Yet never had </p><p>we stalked such game as this. </p><p> The sun had left the pass, but there was</p><p>still light when the Pathans passed under </p><p>us and arrived at the heap of stones. After </p><p>talking together, three of them dismounted </p><p>and began to clear away the stones, drop- </p><p>ping them down the slope into the stream </p><p>to free the path for the elephant. </p><p> We four were silent on the cliff, though</p><p>I could hear Sir Weyand working at the </p><p>fire. The swaying howdah of Most Alast </p><p>came nearer—so near I could see the jewels </p><p>set in the turban of Said Afzel, who was </p><p>laughing with a fat man on the cushion </p><p>by him—Kasim Kirlas, I thought. I could </p><p>have almost reached down and touched their </p><p>heads. </p><p> Then Shirzad Mir bellowed his battle-cry.</p><p> “Hai—Shirzad el kadr—hail”</p><p> He leaped to his feet and began to speed</p><p>arrows down at the riders. </p><p> “Hai—Shirzad el kadrl” I echoed, twang-</p><p>ing a shaft among the camels. </p><p> It must have reached its mark, for one of</p><p>the beasts yelled with pain. I heard the </p><p>shrill shout of the boy and the startled </p><p>cries of the slaves below us. </p><p> Then Sir Weyand came to my side.</p><p> “St. George for England!” he cried. I</p><p>asked him later what it was, and he told me. </p><p> As he shouted, he pushed the cauldron</p><p>over on its side. The boiling fat fell on the </p><p>broad rump of Most Alast. </p><p> An elephant has a thick hide, but he is</p><p>sensitive and nervous as a woman—and </p><p>the boiling grease was very hot. Most </p><p>Alast lifted up his trunk and bellowed his</p><p>pain. Then he charged forward. The </p><p>howdah, with Said Afzel and Kasim Kirlas, </p><p>slipped its girths as Most Alast shook him- </p><p>self—the fat had missed the howdah, to my </p><p>sorrow—and the two went to earth. </p><p> Then Most Alast dashed among the</p><p>riders. Several horses leaped over the </p><p>slope in their fright. Finding himself </p><p>against the stones, the elephant turned in </p><p>the narrow path and charged back against </p><p>the camels, which gave way before him. </p><p>Some stumbled into the brush of the slope. </p><p>Others pressed against the cliff wall. B’il- </p><p>lah, there was much confusion! </p><p> The camels, being frightened and hurt,</p><p>began to yell also, and the horses too. </p><p>The black slaves had leaped to shelter and </p><p>stood watching, their eyeballs showing </p><p>white. The camelmen sought safety where </p><p>they could. </p><p> Shirzad Mir had reckoned well what</p><p>havoc an angered elephant would make </p><p>along that narrow path. </p><p>Said Afzel’s Elephant </p><p>75 </p><p> I was a middling shot with a bow, but</p><p>my lord was a marksman among many. </p><p>His shafts sought out the Pathans, who </p><p>had no time to use their matchlocks before </p><p>they had to leap out of the way of Most </p><p>Alast. Yet he killed none. Before long, </p><p>I knew why. </p><p> “Eai—Shirzad el kadr—hail” cried my</p><p>lord for the last time, and ordered me to </p><p>seek the horses. </p><p> While the boy plied his arrows from the</p><p>cliff, we two, with the Ferang, rode rapidly </p><p>down until our horses stood at the slope </p><p>above the pile of stones. Here Shirzad Mir </p><p>called upon the Pathans to throw down their </p><p>arms. </p><p> A Pathan is a good fighter when and if</p><p>it suits him. These men were less afraid </p><p>of us than of Most Alast, who was trumpet- </p><p>ing back and forth along the path, heedless </p><p>of the efforts of his mahout. They saw that </p><p>we were armed and ready. They did not </p><p>know how many more of us there were. </p><p> Three of the Pathans were hurt by the</p><p>arrows of Shirzad Mir. Two others had </p><p>fallen among the rocks and thorns of the </p><p>slope below. The other two were afoot </p><p>and watching the elephant. </p><p> All who could do so put down their mus-</p><p>kets and swords and said that they had had </p><p>enough of the affair. Shirzad Mir would </p><p>not move until he had seen the two who </p><p>were in the thorn thicket climb out, curs- </p><p>ing, but little the worse for their fall, and </p><p>join the others. Then we left Sir Weyand, </p><p>who had picked up a brace of their dis- </p><p>carded pistols, to watch the group, and </p><p>went forward with me at his side. </p><p> “Find Said Afzel,” he ordered me.</p><p> I saw the Uzbek prince leaning tutbanless</p><p>against a rock, feeling of himself tenderly. </p><p>It is no light thing to fall from the howdah </p><p>of an elephant. Kasim Kirlas, the pro- </p><p>fessional courtier, was stretched on the </p><p>ground at his feet—but this was no salaam; </p><p>the man was stunned. </p><p> Shirzad Mir caught the dazed prince by</p><p>the shoulder and bade him sternly walk </p><p>before his horse. My lord had drawn his </p><p>sword, and this he kept near the bare neck </p><p>of Said Afzel. </p><p> “Where is the elephant?” he asked me.</p><p> I pointed to the stream below and</p><p>Shirzad Mir laughed aloud. He ever </p><p>appreciated a good jest. Most Alast had </p><p>smelled water, and had somehow got him- </p><p>self down the slope to the stream unhurt. </p><p>He was drawing water up in his trunk and </p><p>squirting it over his sore back—mahout </p><p>and all. Later Most Alast lay down in </p><p>the mud. It was many hours before we </p><p>could get him to leave it. </p><p> Shirzad Mir pushed through the be-</p><p>wildered bearers swiftly. Half of the </p><p>camelmen had lied. One or two of the </p><p>eunuchs drew their scimitars when my lord </p><p>came near the camels on which were the </p><p>women, but when they saw the plight of </p><p>Said Afzel, with my lord’s sword at his ear, </p><p>they threw down their weapons. </p><p> It was a sorry gathering that we grouped</p><p>against the cliff wall. Eunuchs and slaves </p><p>are masters of brave words, but I have yet </p><p>to see the ones who will face danger to their </p><p>bodies without shrinking. I cast about </p><p>and discovered that the Pathan who had </p><p>formed the rear guard had fled. </p><p> Shirzad Mir was now master of the field.</p><p>He called to the boy on the cliff—our foes </p><p>thought that many more were there—to </p><p>shoot down the first man of the caravan who </p><p>moved from his place. </p><p> Then he ordered me to ride my horse</p><p>slowly back and forth among the remaining </p><p>camels, the women and their attendants, </p><p>and see that none escaped. </p><p> It was now growing dark, so of my own</p><p>will I set four of the camelmen to building </p><p>a great fire at the lower end of the caravan </p><p>and another by the heap of stones. So it </p><p>happened that when it grew dark we had </p><p>our prisoners securely between the two fires </p><p>and could see all that passed. </p><p> Shirzad Mir had gone straight to the</p><p>Pathans and talked with them a long time. </p><p>Presently he came to me and said:</p><p> “They will join my party, being men who</p><p>sell their swords. For this reason I did </p><p>not slay them. They were near enough </p><p>for good shooting. I have cared for those </p><p>who were hurt. The others are cooking </p><p>food. In the morning we will give them a </p><p>sword apiece—perhaps.” </p><p> With the other attendants we did not</p><p>speak. They were men of low breeding </p><p>and jumped to obey our orders. Shirzad </p><p>Mir kept Said Afzel ever at his side^ in case </p><p>of treachery. </p><p> One at a time we ate of the food for</p><p>which we yearned. The boy joined us' </p><p>proudly, and Shirzad Mir set him to collect- </p><p>ing the few weapons of the eunuchs. Of </p><p>these he made a pile and sat on it, feeling </p><p>greatly the honor we did him. </p><p>76 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Shirzad Mir talked with Said Afzel</p><p>through the night. There was no chance </p><p>for me to sleep, but I think Sir Weyand </p><p>slept a little during his watch over the </p><p>Pathans. Before dawn I had spoken with </p><p>the mahout of Most Alast and given him a </p><p>handful of gold from the treasure bags. </p><p>He—one master being as good as another— </p><p>consented to serve us. </p><p> At dawn I had finished my task. The</p><p>loads were all recovered and placed on the </p><p>camels and the slaves’ backs. All had </p><p>eaten. The women were put back on </p><p>their camels, and the eunuchs herded in </p><p>front. </p><p> At first break of light in the sky we set</p><p>out, my lord and Said Afzel mounted on </p><p>the elephant, who was now quiet, the in- </p><p>jured in litters borne by the slaves, the </p><p>Pathans on their own horses, and the sheep- </p><p>boy on another. </p><p> We struck away from the Shyr Pass into</p><p>the hills. Then, for the first time in two </p><p>days and nights, I slept a little in the saddle, </p><p>being weary, but only a little. </p><p>Ill </p><p>SAID I not our star was in the </p><p>ascendant, so that for a space we </p><p>were given strength to trick our </p><p>enemies? Later, evil fortune came upon </p><p>us again, but not then. </p><p> Three courses were open to my lord.</p><p>He could slay Said Afzel, to strike terror </p><p>into the Uzbeks; he could exchange the </p><p>prince and the women for his own family, </p><p>and perhaps a strip of Badakshan; or he </p><p>could ransom our prisoners for gold with </p><p>which to pay an army. I urged the first </p><p>plan, Sir Weyand the second, and the </p><p>Pathans, who had now cast their fortunes </p><p>with us, the third. </p><p> Our danger was great, for when news</p><p>of what had happened in the pass reached </p><p>Khanjut by way of some escaped bearers, </p><p>the whole army of Jani Beg was sent to </p><p>hunt us down. As yet we had no followers </p><p>other than the four uninjured Pathans and </p><p>the sheep boy, whom Shirzad Mir appointed</p><p>heacf of the camelmen and gave a sword, </p><p>to his great satisfaction. The bearers, the </p><p>slaves and the camel-drivers were useless </p><p>to us and would have been glad to fall again </p><p>into the hands of Jani Beg, who would not </p><p>drive them through the by-paths of the </p><p>hills, as we did. </p><p> It is written in the annals of India, the</p><p>curious thing that my master did in this </p><p>difficulty. </p><p> “We will keep the prisoners and the</p><p>treasure,” he said, “and we will regain the </p><p>foot-hills of Badakshan from Jani Beg; </p><p>also we will gather together a small army. </p><p> And this thing we did, by the will of God.</p><p>How was it done? We held a durbar— </p><p>that is, a crowning ceremony. The people </p><p>of Badakshan had been told my lord was </p><p>dead. The durbar showed them he was not. </p><p> Verily, not before or since has such a</p><p>durbar been held in Hindustan or Badak- </p><p>shan or Turkestan. We traveled with </p><p>the caravan through the villages of the </p><p>hills. At each village Shirzad Mir would </p><p>dismount from Most Alast and spend </p><p>money—from the bags of Said Afzel—for a </p><p>feast. </p><p> Wine he bought freely, and food, and</p><p>scattered silver among the people. So that </p><p>all might see, he held his durbar. Said </p><p>Afzel, the opium-eating prince, he forced to </p><p>do homage in public to him; fat Kasim </p><p>Kirlas, the professional courtier, Shirzad </p><p>Mir made pay him extravagant com- </p><p>pliments; el ghias, the buffoon of the </p><p>caravan, performed his tricks; the musi- </p><p>cians of Said Afzel sang—at the sword </p><p>points of the Pathans—and the dancing </p><p>girls danced. It was a great feast. Shirzad </p><p>Mir, looking the proud king he was by </p><p>birth, sat on cushions under a cloth-of-gold </p><p>tent which we found in the baggage, and </p><p>watched idly, saying nothing. </p><p> Sir Weyand cleaned his soiled garments</p><p>and sat at the right hand of Shirzad Mir, </p><p>as the ambassador from England. Only </p><p>I did not attend, for at every feast I was </p><p>out in the lookout places, with certain men </p><p>of the hills who rallied to our standard, </p><p>keeping watch. The men of Jani Beg </p><p>pressed us close. We moved each day, </p><p>marching in the night to a new village. I</p><p>kept a good watch and at each new place </p><p>more of our men came in to see and hear, </p><p>for rumors of what had happened spread </p><p>through the hills. Shirzad Mir gave to </p><p>them gold and weapons from the store we </p><p>had taken. </p><p> In the plain of Badakshan we could not</p><p>have avoided being overtaken by the </p><p>cavalry of the Uzbeks. But in the hills </p><p>they were at a loss—and the people aided </p><p>us. It was a mad scheme, yet its very mad- </p><p>ness protected us. </p><p>Oh, Lordy, Lordy! </p><p>77 </p><p> He himself put on the jewels he took</p><p>from Said Afzel, and—sitting placidly on </p><p>Most Alast, the black elephant, with the </p><p>two crimson stripes of the Mogul on his </p><p>nose—he looked the king he was. The </p><p>hearts of his old soldiers, who thronged to </p><p>us from the hills, were uplifted at this sight. </p><p> Always Shirzad Mir directed me to</p><p>travel in a circle, through Anderab, Ghori </p><p>and Bamian, back to where we had started, </p><p>at the Shyr Pass. In spite of danger he </p><p>did this, and we all wondered, until one day </p><p>we came to the desolate aid of Iskander </p><p>Khan, as Shirzad Mir had planned. </p><p> When the old Kirghiz chieftain came</p><p>forth and lifted up his hands at the sight, </p><p>Shirzad Mir in his gorgeous robes dis- </p><p>mounted from Most Alast and embraced </p><p>Iskander Khan, while we all watched. </p><p> Then my lord pointed to the caravans,</p><p>to the camels, the treasure and the women. </p><p> “Choose,” said he to Iskander Khan;</p><p>“it is all yours for the asking.” </p><p> But Iskander Khan would not, saying</p><p>that he was unworthy of such honor. </p><p>Whereupon Shirzad Mir called for us all </p><p>to see. He loaded the horse Iskander Khan </p><p>had given him in his need—the fine Arab </p><p>stallion—with pots of gold and gems, and </p><p>put the bridle in the Kirghiz’ hand </p><p>himself. </p><p> He put a robe of ceremony on Iskander</p><p>Khan and girded on him the sword from </p><p>his own waist. </p><p> “This man,” he said loudly, “shall be</p><p>always at my left hand until he dies. Those </p><p>who do homage to me shall bow to him </p><p>also.” </p><p> In this manner did Shirzad Mir pay his</p><p>debt to Iskander Khan. He was a good </p><p>man. A man among ten thousand. Aye, </p><p>among ten times ten thousand. </p><p>OH, LORDY, LORDY! </p><p> Patterson</p><p> 'White</p><p>A u.hor of “High Pockets,” “Lynch Lawyers," etc. </p><p> JL NDY BALL was so thin he couldn’t</p><p>shift his chew without losing his </p><p>balance; he owned more freckles </p><p>■mm to the square foot than a leop- </p><p>ard with the measles, and he was in love </p><p>usual and extensive. He’d a girl in Swing </p><p>Valley—hasher at the hotel—and two in </p><p>Torpedo, till they found each other out; </p><p>he’d another at Morgan’s, one at Deep </p><p>Creek, and the Rafter O cook, all in one </p><p>year. Which is siftin’ along, I’ll say. </p><p> Outside of his being a idjit thisaway, six</p><p>foot tall and a little bow-legged, Andy was </p><p>right human. If he ever used any judg- </p><p>ment I didn’t know it. I remember special </p><p>the time he turned his loving nature loose on </p><p>a three-hundred-pound squarehead young </p><p>lady with her features all in the middle of </p><p>her face and a figure so graceful she </p><p>looked the same anywhere you stood. </p><p> Her name was Susy Svenson, and her pa</p><p>owned a claim back of Baldy. One day, </p><p>when Andy and me were riding in from the </p><p>Blue Creek range, we stopped for the night </p><p>at Ole Svenson’s. From that fatal moment, </p><p>as the man says, his loving nature like to </p><p>been the death of Andy. </p><p> After supper him and Susy got almighty</p><p>friendly—she could cook like a house afire— </p><p>and nothing must do the lady but she’s got </p><p>78 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>to take Andy into the setting-room and show </p><p>him the photograph album, which is </p><p>squarehead for a large evening. </p><p> After a while the lamp went out or some-</p><p>thing, and Susy made a mistake in the dark, </p><p>missed the chair she’s aiming for, and sat </p><p>down on top of Andy. This was too much </p><p>for the self-respect of Andy’s chair. It </p><p>busted simultaneous, and the floor is next. </p><p>The jar overset a fancy clock, weighing </p><p>six pounds and a quarter, off the chimney </p><p>shelf, and the same fetched Andy a healthy </p><p>swipe square between the eyes. Taking the </p><p>lady and the clock together thisaway </p><p>knocked Andy cold like a mule had kicked </p><p>him. </p><p> It took thirty minutes and half the tank</p><p>to bring him to. </p><p> “Let’s go,” he snuffles in my ear when</p><p>he’s able to stand. “Let’s go—now.” </p><p> But going away ain’t so simple as he says</p><p>it. He made the mistake of calling good- </p><p>by before he’s topped his horse, and Susy </p><p>reached the upper gate first. Go? I guess </p><p>not. “I skoll gass not!” </p><p> “I ban like you, Andy,” she says, looking</p><p>like a stuffed tent in the moonlight and not </p><p>minding me a-tall. “More better you stay </p><p>un talk to your leetle Susy.” </p><p> “We gotta be pulling our freight,” pro-</p><p>tests Andy, starting to swing up quick. </p><p> Susy reached out one hand to his collar,</p><p>and he stopped just as quick. </p><p> “Lat’s go in de house,” she says with' a</p><p>smile you could button behind her ears, and </p><p>giving him a playful shake that made his </p><p>teeth rattle. “1 ban make you some </p><p>kaffee.” </p><p> If it had been poison she was fixing to</p><p>feed him he couldn’t have gone along more </p><p>reluctant. </p><p> “By hal,” says Ole, looking after ’em,</p><p>“I tank I lose mein leetle gal.” </p><p> “I’ll bet Andy wishes he could,” I says</p><p>unthinking. </p><p> “He ban like her, huh?” asks Ole, missing</p><p>the point a mile. </p><p> “How can lie help it?” says I. “Love at</p><p>first sight, Ole, that’s what.” </p><p> “Yaw, yaw,” says he vigorous. “I gas</p><p>mabbe I find me gude cook somevare pretty </p><p>-quick.” </p><p> Ole and me tracked along up to the house.</p><p>Going by the kitchen I looked in the win- </p><p>dow. There’s Andy sitting on a chair in </p><p>the corner and grinding the coffee like he </p><p>hadn’t a minute to lose. </p><p> “By yiminy,” Susy was saying, “I skoll</p><p>teach you how to cook.” </p><p> Andy didn’t say nothing but he sure</p><p>looked jo-awful faint and despairing. </p><p> Susy brought coffee to Ole and me out on</p><p>the porch, but her and Andy had theirs in </p><p>the kitchen. Soon Ole went to the corral </p><p>and I turned in for the night. I’m sleeping </p><p>fine when Andy woke me up slumping down </p><p>on the bed. </p><p> “Oh, Lordy! Lordy!” says he under his</p><p>breath, propping his head on his hands. </p><p>“What’s the matter?” I asks him. </p><p>“Whatsa matter?” he gasps in a whisper. </p><p>“Whatsa matter? Say, Bill—” changing </p><p>his tone abrupt— “what am I gonna do?” </p><p>“Whatcha talking about?” I grins. </p><p> “She—she—that female thinks we’re en-</p><p>gaged,” he bubbles out. </p><p> “Ain’t you?” I says.</p><p> “No, I ain’t!” he snaps.</p><p> “Well,” I says, “I thought you was. I</p><p>thought your falling through that chair </p><p>together was a new way of announcing it. </p><p>Shucks, yes. I thought so; Ole he thought </p><p>so; and Susy she thought so. What could </p><p>be fairer than that?” </p><p> But he paid no attention.</p><p> “She thinks I’m gonna marry her,” he</p><p>groans, batting his eyes desperate.</p><p> “I’m stringing my chips with hers,” I</p><p>told him. “Yessir, I sure am. If she says </p><p>you’re gonna marry her, you’re gonna. </p><p>No two ways about that!” </p><p> “Not so loud!” he shushes at me.</p><p>“They’ll hear you! My Gawd, Bill!” he </p><p>rants on, hanging to his trouble like a bull- </p><p>dog to somebody’s pants. “I didn’t even tell </p><p>her I liked her! I didn’t act mushy nor </p><p>soft a-tall. I wouldn’t mind if I had. I’d </p><p>have it coming to me then. But I hardly </p><p>put my arm around her more’n part </p><p>way.” </p><p> “Which was doing right well at that,”</p><p>I says, “even for a long-armed gent like </p><p>you.” </p><p> “I tell you I didn’t mean nothing,” he</p><p>insists. “I was just having pity on the </p><p>poor girl like. I didn’t think—Bill, I can’t </p><p>marry her! I can’t! Look at her! Just </p><p>look at her! Why, it’s plumb ridiculous!” </p><p>I choked off a laugh, and he snarls: </p><p>“That’s right, make fun o’ me! I </p><p>thought you was a friend o’ mine. Will </p><p>you do this much? Tell ’em in the morn- </p><p>ing you ain’t seen me.” </p><p>-	“Sure,” I says. “Why?”</p><p>Oh, Lordy, Lordy! </p><p>79 </p><p> “I’m drifting out of here soon’s they get</p><p>some harder asleep,” he explains, pulling off </p><p>his boots slow and gentle. </p><p> “Yeah,” I says, “I would.”</p><p> “What makes your voice sound so</p><p>funny?” he wants to know, suspicious as a </p><p>weasel. </p><p> “Oh,nothing,” I told him, turning over on</p><p>my stomach so’s he couldn’t see my face, </p><p>’cause the moonlight through the window </p><p>was light as a lamp, and him talking so </p><p>confident of going away was surely a joke. </p><p>I’d looked out the window before I went to </p><p>bed, and he hadn’t—yet. </p><p> Andy reached out the makings and</p><p>smoked lugubrious for a half-hour. Then </p><p>he picked up his boots and tiptoed to the </p><p>window. I watched him swing one leg over </p><p>the sill, and I watched him pull it back. </p><p> “What’s the matter?” I asks him.</p><p> “Nothing,” he whispers without turning</p><p>round. “Good doggie,” he goes on, flapping </p><p>a friendly hand outdoors. “Good feller.” </p><p> I got up and looked over his shoulder.</p><p> “I see the dog’s still there,” I says casual.</p><p>“I noticed him just before I went to bed.” </p><p> Andy grunted and looked anxious at the</p><p>animal. It ain’t much smaller than a good- </p><p>sized calf, and it’s unfolded every tooth in </p><p>its head and growling without a break. </p><p> “Didn’t you know Ole had a dog?” I</p><p>asks Andy. “He keeps it chained out in the </p><p>kennel back of the corral as a rule. He </p><p>must have turned it loose tonight for some </p><p>reason.” </p><p> “You think so?” says Andy. “You’re</p><p>real bright for a young fellow. Good dog- </p><p>gie!” He switches to the animal and started </p><p>to crawl out the window again. </p><p> “R-r-r-r-uff!” roars the good doggie and</p><p>sprung at the window. </p><p> Andy fell back inside and cussed, so I</p><p>turned in—to sleep this trip. I woke up </p><p>sudden to see Andy sliding out the window </p><p>slow and cautious. She was two hours </p><p>later by the moonlight on the floor, and I </p><p>got up and went to the window. I watched </p><p>Andy, his boots in his hand, a tiptoein’ for </p><p>the corral. The good doggie was nowhere </p><p>in sight, you better believe, and the corral </p><p>was only fifty yards away. </p><p> Andy was half-way to the bars when</p><p>there’s a howl at the back of the house and </p><p>a black streak shot round the corner and </p><p>took after Andy. </p><p> Andy didn’t dally. He dropped his boots</p><p>and ran like a jack-rabbit. But for all his </p><p>head start he only reached the corral a nose </p><p>to the good. Andy didn’t climb the gate. </p><p>He just sort of throwed himself at it, and </p><p>before you could wink he’s jack-knifed over </p><p>and up and was roosting all safe on top the </p><p>posts. And that dog was capering round </p><p>below a-uttering the most frightful roars I </p><p>ever heard. Andy was sure stuck, because </p><p>Ole had built his corral as stingy as possible, </p><p>and the bars were so wide apart the dog </p><p>could sift through most anywheres he </p><p>wanted. I saw him do it in seven different </p><p>places just while I stood there. </p><p> I looked for Ole and Susy to wake up and</p><p>rescue the rooster, but they didn’t—rescue </p><p>him I mean. Ole woke up all right, ’cause I </p><p>heard a snicker two windows down. It </p><p>wasn’t my place, me being a guest and all, </p><p>to go calling off no dog as big as a calf, even </p><p>to please a friend. Nawsir! I went back </p><p>to bed, and the last 1 heard before I fell </p><p>asleep was Andy calling the dog names and </p><p>the dog a-worrying and a-teasing Andy’s </p><p>boots all to little flinders. </p><p> Next morning I was up in time to see</p><p>Susy dragging the dog to his kennel and </p><p>Andy climbing down mighty stiff and slow </p><p>and looking after the dog every move he </p><p>makes. </p><p> “Das night air ban bad for folks,” says</p><p>Susy at breakfast, spading fried mush out </p><p>of the pan. “Mabbe you catch cold, huh, </p><p>Andy?” </p><p> But Andy he hadn’t caught cold, only a</p><p>splinter which made him sit sideways, and </p><p>he scraped up a nervous smile to go with</p><p>his, “No, Susy,” that would have fooled </p><p>most anybody. When she told him to </p><p>come see her soon, his face got as long as a </p><p>well-rope. </p><p> “I’d like to, Susy, honest,” he says.</p><p>“I’m gonna miss you like my right eye, but </p><p>we’re so busy shipping feeders just now I </p><p>don’t see how I can manage it right soon. </p><p>You can see how it is, Susy.” </p><p> “I tank more better you come,” she re-</p><p>peats. </p><p> “I tank so, too,” says Ole, and he wiped</p><p>his mouth on his sleeve, got up from the </p><p>table, reached a .45 Winchester off the hooks </p><p>behind the stove and begun to clean it. </p><p>RIDING away from Ole’s place, </p><p>Andy was blue and silent a lot. </p><p>Being in his socks thataway—for </p><p>them boots wasn’t worth saving for patches </p><p>when the dog had finished with ’em—and </p><p>80 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>that bad night on top of his other troubles, </p><p>sure combined to give him a discouraged </p><p>appearance. </p><p> “What’ll I do?” he says at last. “My</p><p>Gawd, what’ll I do now?” </p><p> “You might drown yourself,” I says,</p><p>tapping my nose judicious, “or shoot your- </p><p>self, or eat wolf-pizen. There’s forty ways </p><p>of committing suicide.” </p><p> “Aw, you’re as helpful as a broken leg,”</p><p>he whines, wriggling like the saddle burnt </p><p>him. “This is serious.” </p><p> “You said it was ridiculous a while back,”</p><p>I says. </p><p> With that he shut up and didn’t say noth-</p><p>ing till we’re almost back to the ranch. </p><p> “I’d take it as a favor,” says he, stiff as</p><p>dry rawhide, “if you’ll keep what’s hap- </p><p>pened under your hat.” </p><p> “You won’t mind if I tell Johnny?” I</p><p>asks, cocking my eye at him. </p><p> “Not Johnny!” he busts out. “Whatever</p><p>you do, don’t tell Johnny!” </p><p> Everybody knows Johnny’s tongue is</p><p>hung in the middle and flapping eternal. </p><p>Johnny! What Johnny wouldn’t do to that </p><p>piece of news with his sense of humor— </p><p>Oh, Lordy! Lordy! </p><p> “I ain’t gonna say nothing,” I told Andy,</p><p>“but whyn’t you drag it? Quit the range? </p><p>Go off some’ers and don’t never come </p><p>back?” </p><p> “There’s my claim,” he objects. “One</p><p>hundred and sixty acres almost proved up, </p><p>and that hundred and sixty I bought off </p><p>Riley, and that jag o’ cows I got running </p><p>with the Old Man’s bunch. Go off some’ers </p><p>and lose it all? You’re talking foolish!” </p><p>“You could sell all that stuff,” I suggests. </p><p>“I couldn’t get nothing for it,” says he. </p><p>“You never can at a forced sale.” </p><p> Andy was always forehanded. Yes in-</p><p>deedy. Not that he was exactly tight,</p><p>y’understand, but with all his fool love- </p><p>making he never lost sight of the fact that </p><p>there was a hundred cents to the dollar, </p><p>corral-count. </p><p> “That’s whatsa matter,” he goes on.</p><p>“She knows about that land and them </p><p>cattle. They’re what she’s after. She </p><p>thinks I’m a good thing. She’s a-fixing to </p><p>trap me.” </p><p> “Fixing?” I says. “Well, anyway, Andy</p><p>old-timer,” I tacks on, “let’s hope Ole is a </p><p>poor shot.” </p><p> He was still cussing when we passed the</p><p>windmill. </p><p> Andy didn’t eat much supper that night.</p><p>Next morning the same. So it went for </p><p>three days. Then, when nothing hap- </p><p>pened and no signs of Susy or Ole, he began </p><p>to chipper up and relish his meals. </p><p> The fourth day was Monday. Tuesday</p><p>the Old Man sent Johnny with a message to </p><p>Jake Dawson at Blue Creek. Saturday he </p><p>come back and pounced down on us at </p><p>supper. </p><p> “Congrats!” bawls Johnny, slapping</p><p>Andy so hard between the shoulders he </p><p>lost control of a mouthful of coffee and got </p><p>the hiccups immediate. “Congrats! Y’ </p><p>old fox, whyn’t you tell us you was en- </p><p>gaged to li’l Susy?” </p><p> “Huh—? Andy—? Susy—? Susy Sven-</p><p>son?” </p><p> Them punchers went loony demented.</p><p>And what they didn’t do to Andy! No </p><p>good for him to deny everything, which </p><p>he done vehement. No good a-tall. He </p><p>didn’t eat no more supper. He took him- </p><p>self and his hiccups out to the woodpile and </p><p>sat down on the chopping-block. </p><p> He must have done a power of thinking</p><p>out on that chopping-block, ’cause next day </p><p>at dinner, when Johnny got funny some </p><p>more, Andy jumped him prompt as a split- </p><p>second fuse. </p><p> Johnny was so took by surprize that</p><p>Andy hit him three times before he could </p><p>start. Johnny got a-going final, but one of </p><p>them three cracks of Andy’s was a right to</p><p>the chin and that had tuckered him at the </p><p>go-off. He didn’t have a chance. Inside of </p><p>four minutes he’s licked an’ hollering— </p><p>“Uncle! Uncle! Leggo my ear!” </p><p> Andy unclamped his teeth and got up</p><p>off Johnny. </p><p> “Listen!” says Andy to the rest of the</p><p>boys. “Enough is a-plenty. I like a joke </p><p>but I got my own notion of what’s wit and </p><p>humor, and the next jigger that unloads </p><p>congratulations on to me or sticks Susy into </p><p>the conversation anywheres wants to come </p><p>a-running, ’cause I will.” </p><p> Nobody says a word, and he went out</p><p>to the windmill to slosh water on the eye </p><p>Johnny had closed for him. </p><p> TWO days later Riley’s young one</p><p>fetched over a letter for Andy. </p><p>Andy took it like it’s a hot coal. </p><p>“Whatcha grinning at?” he grunts to </p><p>Riley’s kid. </p><p> “I was just a-thinkin’,” says the young</p><p>Oh, Lordy, Lordy! </p><p>81 </p><p>one,' “how you and Susy musta looked </p><p>when the chair busted.” </p><p> “Shut up!” says Andy, flushing red as</p><p>paint, and then the young one near laughed </p><p>his fool head off and pulled his freight. </p><p> I seen Thompson running to head off the</p><p>young one at the lower gate, but I didn’t </p><p>let on. Pretty soon Andy slid over to me. </p><p> “Susy’s coming here next week,” says</p><p>Andy, shaking the letter. “She says if I </p><p>won’t come to see her, she’ll come to see me. </p><p>What kind o’ girl is she, pursuing a gent </p><p>thisaway? Where’s her pride? Why can’t </p><p>she take a hint? Why can’t she lemme </p><p>alone? Coming here! Her and Ole!” </p><p>“And raaybe Faithful Fido,” I chipped </p><p>in, but he never noticed. </p><p> “Lookit, Bill,” he wades on breathless,</p><p>“you gotta help me. You’re the only </p><p>friend I got in this nest o’ lunatics. They </p><p>all think it’s funny. Funny! My Gawd, </p><p>them jacks would laugh at a lynchin’! </p><p>-it all, I don’t wanna leave, but I gotta </p><p>if she’s coming here. I gotta. And there’s </p><p>my cattle and my land. I’ll have to let </p><p>’em go. I’ll lose money, Bill, see? Tell </p><p>you what now, s’pose you ride over there </p><p>and tell her I’ve changed my mind and I </p><p>wouldn’t marry her on a bet. That </p><p>oughta fix her.” </p><p> “It oughta fix me, too,” I says. “What</p><p>Ole might miss with his Winchester that </p><p>dog won’t overlook. And there’s Susy </p><p>herself. If she’d ever lay a finger on me in </p><p>anger just once, I’ll gamble I’d lose a year’s </p><p>growth. You’re sort o’ light in the heft, </p><p>Andy, but she shook you that time like </p><p>you was even lighter. Nawsir, Andy old </p><p>settler, going over and breaking the bad </p><p>news to Susy and her parent ain’t my idea </p><p>of a pastime.” </p><p> And that’s that, as the man says. Andy</p><p>sags off slack and listless, a-sucking his </p><p>lower lip mighty gloomersome. </p><p> In the evening come supper, the boys was</p><p>all talking about furniture and courtship.</p><p>Was sofys stronger than chairs? Would a </p><p>chair stand a overload? Should a gent hold </p><p>a lady on his left knee or his right or both? </p><p>Thompson says that all depends on the </p><p>lady, and Andy lays down his knife and fork. </p><p> “Tom,” says Andy, cold as a froze steer,</p><p>“did Riley’s kid say anything about me?” </p><p>“I didn’t say so,” answers back Thomp- </p><p>son, “but you can put down a bet Ole </p><p>Svenson has been saying something about </p><p>you to Riley’s kid.” </p><p> I dunno how Andy crossed the table,</p><p>but he’s on top of Thompson anyways </p><p>quicker than he jumped Johnny. Thomp- </p><p>son had the luck to juke Andy’s first swing, </p><p>and Andy’s knuckles skimmed past and </p><p>nudged Sam Bleeker square on the kisser. </p><p>So it’s two to one, with Andy taking the </p><p>short end and using everything from his </p><p>feet to the crockery. </p><p> Of course the folks most concerned, be-</p><p>ing hurried thalaway, hadn’t time to aim </p><p>careful, and when the sugar-bowl shaved </p><p>my ear I went outside. I think there was </p><p>four of us tried to get out the door simul- </p><p>taneous, but I know I was winner. </p><p> “Lookit!” screeches Simmsy, combing</p><p>condensed milk out of his whiskers. </p><p>“Lookit!” </p><p> You’ve guessed it. There’s Susy and</p><p>Ole in a buckboard. She’s a week ahead of </p><p>time. </p><p> “Where’s Andy at?” she wants to know.</p><p> I didn’t need to answer that question</p><p>’cause just then him and the other two pin- </p><p>wheeled out the door in a tangle. For all </p><p>she was fat Susy could move quick. In no </p><p>time she was off the buckboard and had </p><p>Thompson by the hair. The riot calmed </p><p>down abrupt. Sam Bleeker and Thompson </p><p>crawled back into the bunk-house, a»d Susy </p><p>hugged Andy till his ribs cracked. </p><p> “I ban come take you home mit me,” she</p><p>says. “I tank we skoll marry next veek.” </p><p> “Lemme change my clo’es,” begs Andy,</p><p>who’d lost most of his shirt. </p><p> “Better hurry,” advises Ole, and he</p><p>snaked out that .45 Winchester from under</p><p>the seat and laid it across his knees. </p><p> “I’ll be right back,” promises Andy, and</p><p>he scrambles into the bunk-house imme- </p><p>diate. </p><p> I walked round the bunk-house and, sure</p><p>enough, he was crawling through a back </p><p>window. </p><p> “Bill,” he whispers, pointing to the cot-</p><p>tonwoods lining the creek, “I can make it </p><p>to the creek if you’ll keep Susy and Ole </p><p>from getting suspicious. They didn’t fetch </p><p>the dog along, so I’ll be safe hiding out by </p><p>the flat rock in the box-elders, and by and </p><p>by you come tell me what’s happened and </p><p>we’ll figger out what I better do next.” </p><p> I thought to myself he wouldn’t do much</p><p>figgering, but right then didn’t seem the </p><p>proper time to tell him that, so I went back </p><p>round the house again. </p><p> I talked fast and easy, and Susy didn’t get</p><p>82 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>suspicious for as long as ten minutes. </p><p>Then she began to wonder out loud where </p><p>Andy’s at. From wondering she went to </p><p>looking at me kind of hard. I stepped back </p><p>out of arm-reach. She jerked the whip out </p><p>of the socket and allowed plenty decisive </p><p>she’s a-going to search the bunk-house. </p><p> There’s no stopping her. She searched</p><p>that bunk-house, searched it thorough, and </p><p>when she didn’t turn up Andy she’s wild. </p><p>To hear her take on you’d think she’d lost </p><p>a gold watch. </p><p> And all the time Ole was step-laddering</p><p>up and down in front the bunk-house </p><p>a-talking to Heaven about what’s he’s aim- </p><p>ing to do to the skinny shoe-string that’s </p><p>addled the affections of his girl Susy. He </p><p>didn’t leave much unsaid, Ole didn’t, and </p><p>every now and then he’d flick open his </p><p>breech-cover half-way and see was the car- </p><p>tridge still in the chamber. Also he kept </p><p>that rifle cocked. </p><p> Me personal, I was behind the woodpile</p><p>and only an eye peeking up now and then. </p><p>The rest of the boys was engaged similar </p><p>wherever there’s cover. Not that we’re </p><p>afraid of Ole, y’understand, but we couldn’t </p><p>lock horns with him without crowding li’l </p><p>Susy. </p><p> Susy ran down final and shooed Ole into</p><p>the buckboard and drove off, so I went over </p><p>to the flat rock in the box-elders where </p><p>Andy’s a-sitting, both ears on the stretch. </p><p>K2B “WHAT a relief,” he says, easing up </p><p>luxurious when I told him they’d </p><p>gone. “But look here, Bill, didn’t </p><p>I hear Susy screaming and carrying on a </p><p>while back? I sure hope you didn’t try to </p><p>argue with her.” </p><p> “No,” I says, solemn as a coffin, “I</p><p>didn’t try to argue with her and I won’t— </p><p>not while I got my health. And if you wan- </p><p>na keep yours and slay a bachelor you </p><p>fork your horse instanter and drag it full </p><p>split. Nemmine your broad acres and them </p><p>plump cows. Nemmine nothing but how </p><p>soon you can punch the breeze. You hear </p><p>me whistling, cowboy?” </p><p> Andy’s property thataway was the one</p><p>temptation to last it out, but when he’d </p><p>thought twice of Susy and her survigorous </p><p>pa, that half-section sort of dwindled down </p><p>and petered out, and distance lent enchant- </p><p>ment to the view—and the farther away the </p><p>view was the better pleased he’d be to see </p><p>it close. </p><p> After he’d decided to flit he spent the rest</p><p>of the night fixing it up with the Old Man to </p><p>sell his land and cattle for him. It was </p><p>graying to dawn when Andy and me—I </p><p>was a witness—come out of the ofhce, and </p><p>the first thing we ran into outside the door </p><p>was Susy Svenson and her pa! </p><p> Which them two reptyles had outguessed</p><p>Andy once more. As I found out later, </p><p>they’d switched back after leaving the bunk- </p><p>house, cached their buckboard down the </p><p>creek a mile and laywayed for their prey </p><p>the best part of seven hours. </p><p> There’s nothing to do—nothing—abso-</p><p>lutely nothing. Andy Ball was a spent </p><p>shell, a busted flush and a plugged nickel </p><p>from the second Susy ballooned up from </p><p>the log she’s sitting on and lolloped down </p><p>on his neck with a glad and joyful cry of— </p><p> “Oh, my Andy!”</p><p> He got his sentence in less’n five minutes.</p><p>Susy says they’ll drive over to Torpedo that </p><p>very morning and be married by Judge </p><p>Jackman. She wasn’t taking any more </p><p>chances, so she wasn’t. </p><p> Poor Andy! He didn’t have no spirit</p><p>left. He agreed to everything she said </p><p>without a peep. He was so discouraged </p><p>and downhearted I cinched up and rode </p><p>over with ’em to Torpedo just to be sort o’ </p><p>friend-at-the-deathbed-to-the-last like. </p><p> At Torpedo there’s a hitch. Judge</p><p>Jackman, who issued marriage licenses as </p><p>a side line, was out of town. He’s coming </p><p>back on No. 3. So Susy herded Andy down </p><p>to the railroad station to wait for No. 3. </p><p>Ole started to take in the saloons immedi- </p><p>ate, but I trailed along with Andy and his </p><p>keeper. </p><p> Lordy! Lordy! I don’t believe Susy</p><p>hobbled her tongue once them three hours. </p><p>She got Andy’s future mapped out fourteen</p><p>years in advance by the time No. 3 rolled in. </p><p> The first citizen off was Judge Jackman.</p><p>The second was a two-by-tamarack runt </p><p>of a squarehead with pop-eyes, a cowhide </p><p>bag and a tin trunk. He was so short he’d </p><p>have to climb up to sit down, and he stood </p><p>there a-mopping his flat face and blinking </p><p>in the sunlight. </p><p> “Axel! Axel!” squealed Susy, stamped-</p><p>ing down on him. </p><p> “Mein Susy! Mein Susy!” cried the</p><p>squarehead, fending her off with the tin </p><p>trunk and giving her just one quick-action </p><p>kiss. “I ban glad for find you, Susy. I </p><p>ban hunt you tree—four year. How you </p><p>The Makings of a Sailorman </p><p>83 </p><p>vas, huh? Steel mein leetle Susy? You </p><p>steel vait for your boy Axel, huh?” </p><p> “Sure I vas vait,” she tells him. “I vait</p><p>and I vait and I break mein heart vaiting. </p><p>I tank you skoll never come.” </p><p> “Dot’s all your fault,” says he cross-like</p><p>and frowning at her like a bandy-legged </p><p>banty. “You vas leave no address ven you </p><p>leave Veenona, Meenesota. And ven I </p><p>come back from de ol’ country you vas gone </p><p>a year already, and I can not find you. </p><p>And if I haf not seen Yon Yonson in Nort’ </p><p>Platte last veek I tink I skoll never find </p><p>you. Vv vas you leave no address, Susy? </p><p>Dot ban no vay for do. You gotta learn </p><p>do more better, Susy, I tall you. I teach </p><p>you, you bet. We skoll marry right avay. </p><p>You need a man for boss you around. Pick </p><p>up de trunk, Susy, and come along show me </p><p>vare I buy de license.” </p><p> With that this half-portion o’ nothing</p><p>handed Susy the cow-hide bag for good </p><p>measure and spraddled off up Main Street </p><p>like he owned the earth. And Susy did </p><p>what she was told exact as a baa-lamb. </p><p>She’d forgot Andy complete and effectual. </p><p> Me personal, I rubbed my eyes to make</p><p>sure I was awake; then I turned round to </p><p>ask Andy if he seen what I’d been seeing. </p><p>But Andy was having hy-sterics. </p><p>MAKINGS OF A SAILORMAN </p><p> ^ f&amp;qy P. CAurcfi ill</p><p>Author of “The Devil Takes Care of His Own," “Inside and Outsideetc. </p><p>yE WAS so big and husky that </p><p>a pea-coat looked like a vest </p><p>on him. He sat on the after- </p><p>bitts abreast No. 4 hatch on </p><p>the cargo ship Alta, his broad shoes rest- </p><p>ing comfortably on the rail. Presently he </p><p>came hurriedly into the afterquarters. The </p><p>Alta, deep laden, had scooped up a sea, and </p><p>he was dripping wet. </p><p> “I was settin’ on them stumps there,”</p><p>he explained to grinning shipmates, “with </p><p>my feet on the fence, and the water come</p><p>right up and hit me.” </p><p> There you have Orion Saltsman, a big,</p><p>good-natured country boy pried loose from </p><p>his native clods and set down, man size </p><p>and awkward, in the primer grade of old </p><p>Mother Sea. </p><p> “What’re you doing in this outfit, Bud?”</p><p>said the boatswain’s mate, spare and </p><p>gnarled of form and sharp of voice. </p><p> The Alta’s crew, all recruits except the</p><p>skeleton complement of old-timers, had </p><p>been aboard too short a time for “Hasty” </p><p>Day to know them by name, but some men </p><p>take nicknames as a dog does burrs. </p><p> “I aim to learn the work,” said the fanner</p><p>boy with friendly respect. “My name’s </p><p>Saltsman.” </p><p> “Old Salty, eh?” said Hasty. “You’re</p><p>the one that was after me for red and green </p><p>oil for the running lights?” </p><p> “Yes, sir; I aim to do what they tell me</p><p>always.” </p><p> “You do?” said the little man, putting</p><p>that full measure of sarcasm into the tone </p><p>to which his five red enlistment stripes </p><p>entitled him. “Two-thirds of you fellows </p><p>think salt water is something to gargle </p><p>your throat with. Give your conning </p><p>tower an overhauling and see if you can </p><p>find a brain or two. There’s no such thing </p><p>as green and red oil, but if some of these </p><p>wise birds think they’re going to turn this </p><p>ship into a vaudeville circuit, they’ll find </p><p>themselves studying art after hours. You </p><p>84 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>don’t know what that is, either?” asked </p><p>Day, as the boy stood, his whole attitude </p><p>one of question. “Well, it’s painting the </p><p>smoke-stack by moonlight.” </p><p> Hasty Day was a wonder at handling</p><p>recruits. His words were as sharp as </p><p>knives, but they pared away only the outer </p><p>crust and left the heart unhurt. In- </p><p>stinctively Saltsman knew that here was a </p><p>man who would tell him just what he </p><p>wanted to know about this new, strange </p><p>business and with his scathing tongue </p><p>would put him right when he went wrong. </p><p> The Alta was on her maiden voyage with</p><p>a cargo of barreled oil for an English port. </p><p>Her skipper, first lieutenant and navigator </p><p>were merchant seamen serving in the Naval </p><p>Reserve, and in addition to this deck force </p><p>she had two ensigns from the Pelham Bay </p><p>school. Her crew, made up of the different </p><p>required branches, had been sent aboard </p><p>her from a training station only three days </p><p>before she sailed. Most of them were </p><p>young and enthusiastically eager in their </p><p>new job, but depressingly green, as far as </p><p>knowledge of it went. </p><p> The first week out, as if to haze the can-</p><p>didates, there swept down across the </p><p>Grand Banks the best half of a northwest </p><p>gale, raking the deep laden ship with great </p><p>green seas that slapped over the battened </p><p>hatches and whirled and raced up the gang- </p><p>ways to plunge in foaming cataracts over </p><p>the wallowing sides. The Alia groaned </p><p>and pitched and rolled as if she, too, new </p><p>to the job, were taking a beginner’s lesson. </p><p> The crew, having lost interest in the</p><p>palatable concoctions of Tony Ravellotti, </p><p>the cook, stood unsteadily on the boat- </p><p>deck or lay in their bunks near convenient </p><p>deck buckets. The officers and old-timers </p><p>stood the watches. </p><p> Bob Woten, the chief yeoman, had the</p><p>wheel, and Hasty Day came up to relieve him. </p><p> “Course is three hundred and forty de-</p><p>grees,” said Woten, “and the old girl’s </p><p>making a trail like a yeomanette’s first </p><p>shorthand—carrying half a turn left wheel. </p><p>Guess who I relieved, Hasty? Old Salty,</p><p>the farm-hand wonder. Had the wheel </p><p>gripped like the handles of a plow, but </p><p>hanging on and keeping near enough on </p><p>the course to get by. </p><p> “ ‘Hello, old Salty,’ I says to him.</p><p>‘How’s tricks?’ He just grins at me and </p><p>points to the course chalked up there on </p><p>the weather board. </p><p> “ ‘Where you going?’ I asks him, but he</p><p>didn’t answer, having other business at the </p><p>lee rail. Pretty soon he comes staggering </p><p>back. </p><p> “ ‘I’ve had ’em from green apples, and</p><p>from too much watermelon, and going in </p><p>swimming after I et, but this here is kinder </p><p>different,’ he confided to me. ‘Does a man </p><p>ever get over it?’ </p><p> “ ‘Sure!’ I told him. ‘All you have to</p><p>do is to catch a dolphin, get Tony to fry </p><p>the liver with some onions, and eat that. </p><p>Then you’ll be all set.’ </p><p> “He thanked me and went after a fish-</p><p>line. Can you beat it?” </p><p> “That’ll be enough talking, you two,”</p><p>said Ben Hoskins, the watch officer, coming </p><p>out of the chart-room, where he had been </p><p>figuring a time-sight. </p><p>B“I WONDER sometimes,” said the </p><p>captain, joining a discussion at the </p><p>mess table, “why some of these </p><p>boys from inland parts of the country quit </p><p>the job they know and take up the sea.” </p><p>The three days’ storm had blown itself </p><p>out and the recruits had settled back into </p><p>a more normal routine. </p><p> “I can tell you why one of them came,</p><p>sir,” said Bert Hardin, looking solemnly </p><p>across the table at Matthew Cates, the </p><p>other Pelham Bay ensign. “His name is </p><p>Orion and, being named for a star, he wants </p><p>to study navigation.” </p><p> “He’d better begin lower down than the</p><p>stars,” said the captain. </p><p> “He is,” said Clinton Nacke, the first</p><p>lieutenant. “The bunch is breaking him </p><p>in on swab combs and writing letters to be </p><p>left in mail buoys, and have had him up at </p><p>night holding a light at the gangway to see</p><p>if he could catch a flying fish, with the </p><p>ship already in forty north and getting in a </p><p>higher latitude every watch. They’ve tried </p><p>every stunt on him that any of the gang </p><p>knows, and so far he hasn’t failed to fall </p><p>for a one of them. I expect to find him </p><p>on the masthead any time keeping a look- </p><p>out for sea-serpents.” </p><p> So active were his shipmates in Salts-</p><p>man’s education that there came a time </p><p>when they had to let up on him, not because </p><p>he had ceased to take their pranks with </p><p>patient fortitude, but because they had </p><p>tried out all they knew on him and could </p><p>think of few new ones. </p><p> “Old Salty’s getting wised up,” confided</p><p>The Makings of a Sailorman </p><p>85 </p><p>Bob Woten. “He only grinned when </p><p>somebody tried to send him to the pay </p><p>clerk for the key to the keelson. I’d </p><p>already sent him after it once, and that </p><p>was enough.” </p><p> Hasty Day found Saltsman leading</p><p>the deck force in the amount of work done </p><p>in scraping decks, washing paint-work or </p><p>polishing brass. He did it all thoroughly. </p><p>In his speech he mixed the idioms of land </p><p>and sea to the constant merriment of his </p><p>shipmates. </p><p> The new Bowditch which he pored over</p><p>in his spare time became thumb-marked </p><p>and torn with much handling, and the two </p><p>ensigns found him often, in their watch </p><p>below, at the door of their rooms with </p><p>questions. </p><p> “Now this declination,” he would ask;</p><p>“I don’t rightly understand how the old </p><p>sun plows as crooked a furrow as the book </p><p>appears to make it. And what’s these little </p><p>crowfeet here on the chart?” </p><p> In England he bought a second-hand</p><p>sextant and I learned painfully to take </p><p>observations and read the vernier, and to </p><p>keep his thick, sweaty fingers off the already </p><p>stained arc. </p><p>THE Alta discharged her cargo </p><p>of oil and took on general mer- </p><p>chandise between decks and enough </p><p>manganese ore in her lower holds for ballast. </p><p>The raw cold of the North Atlantic was </p><p>trying on the recruits. Before leaving </p><p>the last English port a good many of them </p><p>had severe colds. The hospital apprentice </p><p>reported on the third day that he had put </p><p>two men in their bunks. </p><p> “It might develop into influenza,” said</p><p>the captain. “Watch them closely.” </p><p> The next day the number of sick was</p><p>increased to nine—all afflicted with high </p><p>temperature, aching joints and all the </p><p>symptoms of the epidemic. </p><p> “It’s the flu all right, sir,” the hospital</p><p>apprentice told the captain. “I’d like to </p><p>have a nurse, somebody to help me take</p><p>care of them.” </p><p> “Take who you want,” the captain</p><p>ordered. “Keep them isolated in one </p><p>compartment. Keep the place scrubbed </p><p>and clean.” </p><p> The hospital apprentice asked for a</p><p>volunteer at the mess table that evening. </p><p> “I’ll have to have a little sleep,” he said.</p><p>“I want somebody to go on at night and </p><p>relieve me. All you have to do is to give </p><p>the medicine and keep the worst ones </p><p>covered up and in their bunks.” </p><p> The men looked at one another without</p><p>answering. There had been stories of </p><p>ships found drifting helplessly with all </p><p>the crew sick or dead. The disease was </p><p>known to be extremely contagious, and </p><p>no one was anxious to expose himself.. </p><p>There had come to them letters from their </p><p>shipmates in receiving stations, telling of </p><p>the awful toll of sudden death. </p><p> “All right,” said the hospital apprentice.</p><p>“I’ll just pick put one of you and have the </p><p>captain issue an order.” </p><p> “I didn’t come here to wait on the sick,”</p><p>grumbled one of the men. </p><p> “You just take my job and let me do it</p><p>then,” said Hasty Day, turning on the </p><p>speaker with withering scorn. “All some </p><p>of you fellows know about the sea is sight- </p><p>seeing and drawing your pay.” </p><p> “Do you reckon I could do it?” asked</p><p>Saltsman meekly from the end of the table. </p><p> “Sure, let old Salty do it,” came a chorus.</p><p>“He’s germ-proof. If they got on him </p><p>they’d laugh themselves to death.” </p><p>“You’re it, then, big fellow,” said Hasty </p><p>Day, “if you mean it. But if you want </p><p>to back out, I’ll give one of these would-be </p><p>comedians a chance. Most of them never </p><p>got by that place in their lives where they </p><p>first learned to let old George do the mean </p><p>jobs.” </p><p> “I’d try it,” said Saltsman. “Neighbors</p><p>had to wait on the sick a little back home. </p><p>It’d give me more time for my figgering, too, </p><p>maybe.”</p><p> “Unanimously elected,” said Hasty Day,</p><p>glaring about -him. </p><p> And so it was decided.</p><p> In the days that followed, the volunteer</p><p>nurse had small chance to look into his </p><p>navigation books. His patients demanded </p><p>all of his strength and every moment of </p><p>his time. Patiently he soothed their fever </p><p>with icy wet cloths, washed their faces </p><p>and brought them food and drink. In </p><p>between times, often to the accompaniment </p><p>of groans and the labored breathing and </p><p>muttering of men half delirious, he </p><p>scrubbed and cleaned continuously. </p><p> He and the hospital apprentice relieved</p><p>each other in turns of eight hours each, </p><p>night and day, while the crew stood aloof, </p><p>shunning witii awe the affected compart- </p><p>ment. More men caught the epidemic, </p><p>86 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>until fifteen were down, and one night, </p><p>while Saltsman watched, a man died, </p><p>despite the stimulating hypodermic which </p><p>the hospital apprentice had taught him to </p><p>use. </p><p> The crew grew panicky, fear ridden,</p><p>suspicious of every cough and sneeze, and </p><p>went hurriedly away when Saltsman or the </p><p>hospital apprentice appeared. </p><p> Saltsman grew pale and hollow-eyed,</p><p>but kept cheerful with strength which </p><p>seemed endless. Hasty Day, one of the </p><p>few who refused to be in any way affected, </p><p>asked him about a relief. </p><p> “I guess I’d better keep on,” said Salts-</p><p>man. “These others ain’t had no fair </p><p>chance to learn, and there might be some, </p><p>like little Bobbie White, that I could keep </p><p>from going even if I did fail with him.” </p><p> “Seems as if you’d be afraid of getting it</p><p>yourself, sticking so long,” said Hasty. </p><p> “I never had nothing in my life,” said the</p><p>other solemnly. </p><p> “All right, old Salty, go right to it,”</p><p>said the boatswain’s mate. “You and </p><p>‘Pills’ are doing fine, but there’s no need </p><p>to row a good boat on the rocks, either.” </p><p> Gradually the epidemic began to release</p><p>its grip on the ship. Those who were </p><p>seriously ill passed the crisis, and the fighter </p><p>cases became convalescent. As if its pres- </p><p>ence aboard had innoculated the rest of the </p><p>crew with an antitoxin, no more cases </p><p>appeared. </p><p> With his charges giving less trouble,</p><p>Saltsman took up his navigation again. </p><p>He had an old pilot chart of the North </p><p>Atlantic and put down each day with a </p><p>pencil a ringed dot to mark the position </p><p>he found. The chart was worn and showed </p><p>many erasures, and Saltsman’s marks, </p><p>where he had laboriously sought to make </p><p>his own calculations come somewhere near </p><p>the correct noon positions, bore a striking </p><p>resemblance to the irregular outline of a </p><p>range of mountains. Still he was making </p><p>progress, and his faithfulness with the sick</p><p>made the officers more lenient toward his </p><p>many questions. </p><p> THE Alta, bound for the Gulf ports,</p><p>came to the straits between Florida </p><p>and the Bahama Islands. At dusk </p><p>one night she passed Jupiter light. Salts- </p><p>man had the chart spread out on an empty </p><p>bunk and crouched beside it on his knees. </p><p>A penciled cross marked the position of the </p><p>ship, while he measured from the margin </p><p>the distance off shore. So engrossed was </p><p>he that Ben Hoskins, the watch officer, </p><p>had to call twice, rather loudly, before </p><p>Saltsman got up and came to the door of the </p><p>compartment, his stub of a pencil still </p><p>clutched in his fingers. </p><p> “Give me a shot of something for my</p><p>head, will you?” demanded the officer. </p><p>“Make it pretty strong, too.” </p><p> “Yes sir,” said Saltsman and unlocked</p><p>the little woven-wire clothes locker that </p><p>he and the hospital apprentice had taken </p><p>for a medicine chest. </p><p> “Has the doctor given you anything yet?”</p><p>asked Saltsman. </p><p> “No! What’s that got to do with it?</p><p>Shake a leg and let’s have something. I’m </p><p>on watch.” </p><p> The navigator was cross and irritable.</p><p>He was unused to sickness of any kind. </p><p>His temples throbbed, and a burning cord </p><p>seemed to draw at the back of his head. </p><p>He felt feverish, and his throat was parched </p><p>and dry. Saltsman rolled out from a bottle </p><p>labeled “aspirin,” a couple of white pellets </p><p>and drew off a glass of water. </p><p> “This here’s for the headache, sir,” he</p><p>said. “Let ’em go down whole. It gen- </p><p>erally takes two doses if the headache’s bad. </p><p>I’ll bring the other up to the bridge when </p><p>it’s time for it.” </p><p> The officer swallowed the medicine, and</p><p>Saltsman watched him walk rather un- </p><p>steadily to the boat-deck ladder and </p><p>climb up. </p><p> “He acts like he’s got it, too,” he said</p><p>to himself and started back to the chart </p><p>room, pausing to close the medicine chest.</p><p>“By golly,” he said as he eyed the row of </p><p>bottles, “doc always gives salts, too, and </p><p>I forgot it.” </p><p> Pouring out a liberal dose into the glass</p><p>Hoskins had used, he dissolved it in water </p><p>heated over a little alcohol lamp. Then, </p><p>making a round of the patients and seeing </p><p>them all quiet, he followed the officer to the </p><p>bridge. </p><p> The night was dark and heavily overcast.</p><p>The wind which had been blowing from al- </p><p>most dead ahead, was now abeam. Coming </p><p>from the lighted compartment to the </p><p>darkened bridge, Saltsman could not see </p><p>very well at first. Only the quartermaster </p><p>at die wheel and the dark blur of a bundled </p><p>up signal-boy pacing back and forth were </p><p>in sight. </p><p>The Makings of a Sailorman </p><p>87 </p><p> “Where’s Mr. Hoskins?” asked Saltsman</p><p>in low tones, going over and looking into </p><p>the binnacle past the helmsman’s shoulder. </p><p> “Back to the chart - room, I guess.</p><p>What’re you doing, Salty? Helping him </p><p>navigate?” </p><p> Saltsman grinned. Being kidded about</p><p>studying navigation had never worried him. </p><p> “I brought him some medicine,” he</p><p>said. </p><p> “Well, you’d better give it to him,” said</p><p>the other. “He’s peevish enough to heave </p><p>you over the side if he catches you chewing </p><p>the fat with the man at the wheel. Beat </p><p>it now, before you’re caught.” </p><p> Saltsman could not resist another look</p><p>at the compass, despite the other’s warning. </p><p> Saltsman noted that the course was two</p><p>hundred and seventy degrees. He repeated </p><p>the figures over to himself to keep from </p><p>forgetting them as he went toward the </p><p>chart-room. </p><p> The side door was open, and at its</p><p>entrance he called softly. Getting no </p><p>answer, he went on in. At once he caught </p><p>the sound of heavy, labored breathing, </p><p>and in a moment he was kneeling over the </p><p>officer’s body lying full length on the deck. </p><p>Saltsman took hold of his shoulder and </p><p>shook him. Hoskins groaned, threshed </p><p>up with his arms and sent the glass which </p><p>Saltsman held spinning across the deck. </p><p> The motion was one of delirium and</p><p>from his nursing the sailor recognized it, </p><p>even in the dark. He put his hand on the </p><p>officer’s forehead and then down inside his </p><p>shirt. The man seemed afire with the fever </p><p>that racked him. Saltsman wondered what </p><p>to do next. In the back of his consciousness </p><p>he was still repeating the course he had read </p><p>from the compass, and suddenly he realized </p><p>it was wrong. He had just left half an </p><p>hour’s painful study of his chart and re- </p><p>membered that the true course was almost </p><p>south. </p><p> “Two hundred and seventy degrees,”</p><p>he said. “Ought to be one hundred and </p><p>seventy, or near-abouts.” </p><p> He shook Hoskins again and tried to</p><p>rouse him. Then he thought of the night </p><p>order book, the purpose of which he had </p><p>tried so faithfully to memorize. Leaving </p><p>Hoskins, he switched on the light over the </p><p>broad desk where the charts were spread </p><p>and found the course written in ink as </p><p>plainly as could be—signed with the cap- </p><p>tain’s initials—“One hundred and seventy </p><p>degrees.” The chart was there also, to </p><p>show plainly that the course should be </p><p>almost due south instead of west. </p><p> By tlie light Saltsman saw, too, that</p><p>Hoskins’ face was flushed, his mouth open, </p><p>and his hands gripping convulsively. His </p><p>unseeing eyes stared straight up at the deck </p><p>overhead. </p><p> “Bad off,” said Saltsman. “Must’ve</p><p>fell in a faint, like Tilman did. I’d better </p><p>call doc.” </p><p> Shoving aside the chart and navigation</p><p>books, he lifted the heavy man to the desk </p><p>and put an oilskin coat under his head. </p><p>Then he ran out on the bridge again to see </p><p>if by any chance he had been mistaken in </p><p>the reading of the compass. </p><p> “What’s all the excitement?” asked the</p><p>quartermaster, who had heard the breaking </p><p>glass. “Did he throw the stuff at you?” </p><p>“Mr. Hoskins is bad sick. I’m going </p><p>after doc. But you’re steering the wrong </p><p>course. It ought to be one hundred and </p><p>seventy, not two hundred and seventy.” </p><p>“Must’ve had a shot too many of your </p><p>own dope,” said the quartermaster calmly. </p><p>“Fooling with the wild ones in the sick </p><p>bay must be catching. Go see about Mr. </p><p>Hoskins and turn off that light you left </p><p>burning in the chart-room.” </p><p> “The course is wrong, I tell you,” in-</p><p>sisted Saltsman, “and it’s narrow along </p><p>here. Change it right away before I go.” </p><p>“Change nothing, you big boob! What </p><p>do you think I am, taking orders from a </p><p>baby whale? Changing the course without </p><p>proper orders is apt to put a man in jail </p><p>for the rest of his life, if he’s unlucky enough </p><p>to still have it when the ship hits the </p><p>beach.”</p><p> “But it’s there in the book,” said Salts-</p><p>man, growing more excited all the time. </p><p>“I saw it. Hurry, so I can go on and do </p><p>something for Mr. Hoskins!” </p><p> “I go by my orders, bo,” said the other</p><p>firmly. “Brush on by, now. If you’re </p><p>so sure of yourself, wake up the old man </p><p>and tell him your troubles, but don’t tell </p><p>’em to me.” </p><p> “Get away from there,” said the big</p><p>sailor with sudden determination. “You’re </p><p>heading wrong, certain and sure.” </p><p> He took hold of the wheel, struggling for</p><p>its possession. </p><p> Micky Morton, the quartermaster, was</p><p>one of the old-timers, squarely built and </p><p>stocky. He tried to hold the wheel and, </p><p>88 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>with elbows and back, to shake Saltsman </p><p>off, but, despite all he could do, it went over, </p><p>spoke by spoke, and very slowly the big </p><p>ship began to swing around. </p><p> “Let go!” said Micky wrathfully and</p><p>stepped back, swinging a straight blow for </p><p>Saltsman’s face. </p><p> The quartermaster’s aim was good and</p><p>there was no attempt to parry. It would </p><p>have been a knockout for most any one </p><p>else, but Saltsman only grunted, shook his </p><p>head, and swept back with one of his big </p><p>hands, holding the wheel over with the other. </p><p>The move was unexpected, as the quarter- </p><p>master had good reason to believe that his </p><p>blow would put the man out, and in the </p><p>dark he did not see it coming. He was sent </p><p>spinning across the bridge. </p><p> “You leave me be,” said Saltsman with-</p><p>out anger. “I know what I’m about.” </p><p>“Same as all the other nuts from the nut </p><p>farms,” retorted the quartermaster, his head </p><p>ringing with the mighty cuff. </p><p> He collided with the nest of speaking-</p><p>tubes that went below, and jerked out one </p><p>of the plugs to whistle for the captain. </p><p> “I’ll have the Old Man up. Come on</p><p>over here, Bert,” he called to the signal-boy. </p><p>“Gimme me a hand with this loco hay </p><p>pitcher. Can’t wait for an answer, but the </p><p>whistle will bring him.” </p><p> Bert was reluctant.</p><p> “Maybe Mr. Hoskins did say one hun-</p><p>dred and seventy and not two hundred and </p><p>seventy,” he temporized. “Let’s wait for </p><p>the skipper.” </p><p> “Wait nothing! This bird’s gone wild.</p><p>He’ll pile us up on the beach while the </p><p>Old Man is getting his boots on. Grab </p><p>him around the legs while I sink another </p><p>hot one in his jaw.” </p><p> “You two let me alone,” begged Salts-</p><p>man. “I don’t want to hurt neither one </p><p>of you, but I’m a-going to hold this here </p><p>wheel till she reads a hundred and seventy.” </p><p>The two men advanced, using con-</p><p>siderable caution. The Alta was swinging </p><p>sluggishly with left wheel. </p><p>“LIGHT HO!” exclaimed the sig- </p><p>nalman suddenly. </p><p> “Where away?” answered the</p><p>quartermaster mechanically, wondering </p><p>what other complication was developing </p><p>to confuse a situation still far from solution. </p><p> “Red light half a point on the starboard</p><p>bow!” cried the signalman, pointing. </p><p> “Schooner or something,” said the quar-</p><p>termaster. “No masthead light. We’re </p><p>right on top of her, and she’s got all the </p><p>right of way there ever was! Suffering Pete, </p><p>what a smash-up! Pull that whistle cord, </p><p>Bert! Three blasts!” </p><p> The quartermaster jumped for the en-</p><p>gine-room telegraph, intending to back the </p><p>engines. </p><p> Saltsman was the quicker. He had seen</p><p>the light, too, and, picking up the grating </p><p>which smaller helmsmen used to stand on, </p><p>he jammed it under the wheel to hold it </p><p>where he wanted, and ran to the telegraph. </p><p>Micky felt himself picked up bodily, his </p><p>hand torn from the lever. As he was </p><p>thrown down the deck, he heard Saltsman’s </p><p>grunt of effort. The pointer still stood </p><p>at full speed ahead. </p><p> Bert, the signal-boy, had reached the</p><p>wheel, pulled out the grating, and started </p><p>to revolve the spokes to stop the Alta’s turn. </p><p> “Keep away, buddie,” warned Saltsman.</p><p>“I’m going to do the steering till the captain </p><p>gets here.” </p><p> At his command the signal-boy let go</p><p>promptly. Even with the quartermaster’s </p><p>help he was doubtful of success in subduing </p><p>the big sailor. </p><p> Saltsman took the wheel. The red light</p><p>was now broad on the starboard lx&gt;w. </p><p> “That'll clear now,” he muttered and</p><p>spun the wheel over, reversed the helm, and </p><p>began to steady the big ship. </p><p> “Green to green and red to red,” he</p><p>muttered to himself, “keep your course and</p><p>go ahead.” </p><p> The quartermaster, scrambling back from</p><p>the wing of the bridge where Saltsman’s </p><p>heave, and a roll of the ship at the same </p><p>time, had thrown him, came up behind again. </p><p> “Don’t you know anything, you big</p><p>farmer?” he shouted. “You’ve got your </p><p>green light to the other fellow’s red one. </p><p>Put her over right wheel, quick, before we </p><p>cut her in two!” </p><p> Again he attempted to reach the spokes,</p><p>but as before Saltsman shook him off. </p><p>Micky Morton’s morale was still good, </p><p>but the feel of the big sailor’s enormous </p><p>strength had made him wary. </p><p> “You’re trying to fool me," said Salts-</p><p>man. “I don’t trust you. Red to red the </p><p>book says, and I learnt it by heart. She’s </p><p>passing, anyhow, whatever it is.” </p><p> “Yes, I see,” said the quartermaster</p><p>scornfully. “All the real sailors are not </p><p>The Makings of a Sailorman </p><p>89 </p><p>dead yet. The skipper of the other craft </p><p>must have put her about, seeing that who- </p><p>ever was at the wheel here meant to run </p><p>him down, rules or no rules. Give me that </p><p>wheel now, you bone-headed pumpkin </p><p>peeler, and quit this monkey business. </p><p>Come on, Bert. We’ve got to manhandle </p><p>this guy.” </p><p> The two made another determined but</p><p>unsuccessful attempt to wrest the wheel </p><p>from Saltsman. The fight was interrupted </p><p>in its first stages by the voice of the captain, </p><p>coming up from below, seeing first the light </p><p>on the bow, and then the struggling men </p><p>at the wheel. </p><p> “What’s going on here? Where is the</p><p>officer of the watch? What’s that light on </p><p>the bow?” </p><p> Quickly he swung his night glasses into</p><p>position and gave a sharp, quick order— </p><p>“Left wheel!” </p><p> Micky and Bert fell back at once, and</p><p>Saltsman obeyed the order promptly. The </p><p>red light came on the beam, on the quarter, </p><p>and then showed up astern. </p><p> “Ease your helm,” ordered the captain.</p><p>“Steady at eighty for the present. Now </p><p>tell me what happened.” </p><p> “Things were all right, sir,” answered</p><p>the quartermaster, “running along as </p><p>smooth as could be until this fellow came </p><p>running up here saying we were off the </p><p>course, and taking the wheel away from me. </p><p>He said Mr. Hoskins was sick in the chart- </p><p>room and we ought to be steering one hun- </p><p>dred and seventy instead of two hundred </p><p>and seventy.” </p><p> “The course is one hundred and seventy,”</p><p>the captain broke in sharply. “It’s in the </p><p>night order book. That red light is on a </p><p>gas buoy at the end of Barrier Shoals. It’s </p><p>a good thing somebody changed the course. </p><p>What’s the reason I wasn’t called sooner?” </p><p>“I did call you, sir, as soon as I could get </p><p>to the tube, but Mr. Hoskins told me </p><p>plainly that it was two hundred and </p><p>seventy. Then he went to the chart-room </p><p>and didn’t come back.”</p><p> “Never mind about, that. It’s easy to</p><p>confuse one and two with no one here to </p><p>check up. Get aft on the run and take a </p><p>sounding. And you, signal-boy, jump be- </p><p>low and break out the doctor. Where is </p><p>Mr. Hoskins?” </p><p> “He’s in the chart-room, sir,” said Salts-</p><p>man, “lying on the table.” </p><p> Then, still holding the wheel, Saltsman</p><p>told his part of the story in halting, em- </p><p>barrassed sentences. </p><p> “You thought the red light was a ship,</p><p>did you?” </p><p> “Yes sir,” said Saltsman. “The quar-</p><p>termaster said it was a sailing vessel of </p><p>some kind because she didn’t carry a mast- </p><p>head light. And I made a big mistake, sir, </p><p>being worried and upset with so many </p><p>things on my mind. I was thinking our </p><p>red light was next to that red light, and </p><p>kept Her going straight. If it had been a </p><p>sliip we would have run together. But </p><p>captain, the boys was pestering me a lot, and </p><p>pulling at me. I just naturally forgot.” </p><p>“It’s a blessing you did,” said the skipper, </p><p>“and I hardly believe you will ever forget </p><p>that little point again. This time, if you </p><p>had read the fights correctly, we should </p><p>have run straight in across Barrier Shoals </p><p>instead of outside in deep water. Taking </p><p>charge as you did saved the ship. I’m </p><p>going to see that you get a better chance </p><p>to study navigation. You’ve got the </p><p>makings of a real sailorman in you.” </p><p> This from the captain meant a great deal,</p><p>and Saltsman knew it. He had been </p><p>anxious about the outcome of what he had </p><p>done, and here was praise heaped upon </p><p>him. He stood seeking words to express </p><p>his gratitude, but before he could speak the </p><p>captain went on: </p><p> “Here come the others,” he said. “Get</p><p>on below now and see if you can help with </p><p>Mr. Hoskins.” </p><p> Ben Hoskins was revived with a whiff</p><p>of ammonia and carried to his room. The </p><p>moderate dose of aspirin, given for the head- </p><p>ache, had been sufficient to slow up his </p><p>heart and make him faint, but left no bad </p><p>after effects. With the usual few days of</p><p>fever, he began to get well. During his </p><p>convalescence he laid out a course of study </p><p>for Saltsman which had the captain’s </p><p>approval. He was quite as grateful as </p><p>the captain for what the boy had done, for </p><p>had the Alta gone on the reef, he would have </p><p>been responsible, as it was his watch. </p><p> “I’ll have you ready to take out a license</p><p>as soon as you get your discharge,” he </p><p>promised Saltsman and kept his word. </p><p>GENTLEMEN </p><p>OF THE NORTH </p><p> /1 Four-Part Story</p><p> Part m</p><p> Hugh Penclexter</p><p>Author of “Red Bells,” “When Kentucky Starved,” etc. </p><p>The first part of the story briefly retold in story form. </p><p>T3LACK CHABOT, manager of the Pembina post </p><p>of the North West Company, was as fond of </p><p>“high wine”—alcohol diluted with water—as were the </p><p>Indians with whom he traded. He was more lavish </p><p>with the “new milk” than were the other posts, and </p><p>consequently his Chippewas were usually drunk. </p><p>Gradually his power was waning, for the Indians had </p><p>little respect for the white man who got drunk with </p><p>them. As his clerk, I was the only one at the post </p><p>who still held their respect, for I never drank. </p><p>Even Old Tabashaw, their chief, seldom disobeyed </p><p>me. </p><p> It was April in the first year of Black Chabot’s</p><p>management, 1804; new skins were coming in, and </p><p>the Indians were in an ugly, drunken mood. I </p><p>realized that they were bent on making trouble. </p><p> “We will kill the white men and take their new</p><p>milk for ourselves.” </p><p> It was old Tabashaw, the Chippewa Chief, who had</p><p>spoken, and I knew the threat was not an idle one. </p><p> “The Sioux! The Sioux are upon us!”</p><p> Black Chabot brought this news. There was</p><p>nothing that could sober the Chippewas so quickly </p><p>as this alarm, and only their preparations to defend </p><p>themselves saved the white men at the post. </p><p> Flat Mouth, one of the Chippewas, was the only</p><p>one I felt I could trust, and so I dispatched him to </p><p>learn if the Sioux were really upon us. When he </p><p>returned, it was with the news that the smoke which </p><p>had caused the alarm had been made by friendly </p><p>Crees and Assiniboins bringing trade. The danger </p><p>was past, but the rumor had served its turn; the </p><p>Chippewas were quiet. </p><p> The next day I was dispatched to the X. Y., a</p><p>rival post, to make an agreement against sending </p><p>men out to drum up trade. At the N. W. posts on </p><p>the Reed and on the Scratching, I stoppped to order </p><p>the managers to be prepared to send their skins </p><p>down the river. I knew that the brigade would</p><p>start soon and was happy, for back at headquarters </p><p>I had determined to ask for transfer—anything </p><p>to get away from Black Chabot. </p><p> Both Desset and Probos, the managers of these</p><p>two posts, aroused my suspicions. They seemed to </p><p>be madly hurrying to pack their skins, but the </p><p>brigade seldom left till June and it was now only </p><p>April. Desset claimed that his books had been </p><p>burned by a drunken Indian, and all his accounts </p><p>destroyed. He seemed, too, to have very few skins, </p><p>yet the season had been a good one. Then from one </p><p>of Desset’s men I learned that the manager had </p><p>been sending skins down the river secretly. Desset </p><p>had secured his post through Black Chabot, so I sus- </p><p>pected that all of the managers were involved in a </p><p>plot to cheat the North West Company. </p><p> At the X. Y. I reached an agreement with Red</p><p>Dearness, the rival manager. There, too, I tried to </p><p>solve the mystery of Red Dearness’ woman, reported </p><p>by some to be a half-breed. I heard her speak and </p><p>knew from her talk that she was educated, but I did </p><p>not see her. </p><p> The next morning at the Scratching pest, I was</p><p>dumbfounded to see Black Chabot and the brigade </p><p>coming down the river, their canoes loaded with </p><p>skins. Why had they started so early? It was then </p><p>that the blow fell. Black Chabot ordered me to </p><p>stay at the Pembina post and take charge during </p><p>the Summer. I was not to go back to the country </p><p>of the whites where I had not been in three years. </p><p>The disappointment was great, but I mastered it </p><p>and started back to the post while Chabot and Des- </p><p>set set off. On my way I saw that Red Dearness, </p><p>too, was going down the river with his skins. </p><p> Another Sioux scare sent Flat Mouth and myself</p><p>south of the Pembina to investigate. A detach- </p><p>ment of warriors was encountered and Flat Mouth </p><p>brought back four scalps. </p><p> At the post some Crees and Assiniboins came in,</p><p>but they refused to hunt. I finally found the reason. </p><p>Their medicine had been stolen. The voice from </p><p>Riviere Qu’Appelle, the River Tha* CaUs, had dis- </p><p>appeared. This river, a ma:n fork J the Assini- </p><p>boin, was regarded with much fear by the Indians of </p><p>the Northwest. It was supposed to be haunted by a </p><p>mi: 'ity spirit which cried aloud in its flight up and </p><p>down the course. Such a voice had been heard on </p><p>the Pembina recently, and the Crees believed it had </p><p>been stolen by the Chippewas. </p><p> Accustomed to Indian superstition, I realized</p><p>what disastrous results this would have on the</p><p>morale of my hunters. I promised that the voice </p><p>should be restored in month. </p><p>90 </p><p>Gentlemen of the North </p><p>'T'HE next day I received a call from Red Dear- </p><p>ness’ “woman” and, to my surprize, discov- </p><p>ered that this woman was the trader’s daughter </p><p>and not a half-breed wife as had been rumored. </p><p>Her fiery red hair had caused the Indians to give </p><p>her the name “Medicine Hair” and credit her with </p><p>supernatural powers. </p><p> Her call was a matter of business. She urged me</p><p>to stop trading rum with the Indians and to my </p><p>amusement told me she had already discontinued </p><p>the practise. </p><p> She also revealed to me the mystery of the Voice.</p><p>In her visit to the Pembina she had often sung along </p><p>that lonely river, and the Indians, hearing this, had </p><p>believed her voice to be that of the River That </p><p>Calls. </p><p> Before leaving she threatened to use her power</p><p>over the superstitious Indians to force them to trade </p><p>skins without rum. I laughed at her, well knowing </p><p>the power of high wine. </p><p> As the days passed, however, my trade fell oil</p><p>alarmingly. </p><p> Crazy for rum, one of the X. Y. Indians stole a</p><p>keg from the N. W. I started out after him, and </p><p>my quest finally brought me to Miss Dearness. She </p><p>forced the Indian to return the keg, and so quickly </p><p>did he do her bidding that I then realized how great </p><p>was her power over the savages. </p><p> “God! But you’re a tearing beauty!” said a</p><p>thick voice. </p><p> Miss Dearness and I turned to find that Black</p><p>Chabot had returned—drunk as usual. He leered </p><p>at the woman and informed her that he had over- </p><p>taken the X. Y. brigade down the river, and that her </p><p>father had died during the trip. </p><p> As he reached at Miss Dearness, I knocked him</p><p>down. </p><p>91 </p><p> The fight was one-sided, for Black Chabot was</p><p>very drunk. I finally drove him down the river, </p><p>swearing that, if he ever returned I would kill </p><p>him. </p><p> A few days later I learned that Miss Dearness</p><p>had gone up the river in search of skins. To my </p><p>surprize, too, I learned that she had played upon </p><p>the superstitions of Flat Mouth to force him to ac-</p><p>company her. </p><p> Realizing the danger she ran in the Sioux coun-</p><p>try, I finally resolved to follow. Packing some </p><p>white buffalo robes, which are considered “big medi- </p><p>cine” by all tribes except the Chippcwas, I set out </p><p>alone, leaving Probos in charge. </p><p> On the way my worst fears were confirmed. I</p><p>encountered a hostile Sioux scout. Fearing lest I </p><p>was already too late, I hastened on up tfie Red </p><p>Lake River. </p><p> There I found more signs of the enemy. Then,</p><p>suddenly, the undergrowth parted and I caught a </p><p>glimpse of disheveled red hair. </p><p> The friendly Pillager, Flat Mouth, was close be-</p><p>hind. The three of us united and made our way to </p><p>the river and crossed, only to find a dozen of the </p><p>enemy awaiting us. </p><p> Here, however, the white robes I had brought</p><p>came into use. Miss Dearness wrapped one around </p><p>both Flat Mouth and myself. The Sioux, seeing </p><p>the powerful medicine, hesitated, and we succeeded </p><p>in gaining shelter in the woods. </p><p> There, surrounded by the Sioux, we decided to</p><p>wait until night. I trusted to my double-barreled </p><p>gun and their fear of the medicine robes to keep the </p><p>Indians off till darkness could aid our escape. But </p><p>there was only one chance in a thousand that we </p><p>could win free and back-track safely through the </p><p>long reaches of that wild country. </p><p>CHAPTER VII </p><p> THE SIOUX RECEIVE REINFORCEMENTS</p><p> THIS encouraged us tremendously.</p><p>Miss Dearness stuck more willow </p><p>branches around our two forts, </p><p>while I remained with the </p><p>chief, who was curiously watching the </p><p>Indians on the plains. All of the Sioux </p><p>were now mounted, the horses the Pil- </p><p>lager had captured being replaced by those </p><p>whose owners had fallen. For some minutes </p><p>the band milled about; then one man </p><p>rode aside and began haranguing in a </p><p>loud voice. The Pillager, who had traveled </p><p>and lived on the Missouri, readily inter- </p><p>preted the speech, which consisted of ex- </p><p>hortations for the Sioux to remember they </p><p>were brave men, that our scalps must go </p><p>back to their village to wipe out their dis- </p><p>grace in having lost warriors. The white</p><p>woman was to be taken alive. I was glad </p><p>Miss Dearness was busy with her willow </p><p>wands, for the Pillager interpreted word for </p><p>word, and she understood the Chippewa </p><p>tongue almost as well as she did English. </p><p> When the speechmaker desisted the</p><p>Sioux swung into a long line, a maneuver </p><p>beautifully executed. In this formation </p><p>they came towards us at a walk, tossing </p><p>up their lances, waving their axes and sing- </p><p>ing lustily. I made ready with my gun, </p><p>picking the leader and a man on the left </p><p>end as my two victims, but Flat Mouth </p><p>folded his arms and did not even see to it </p><p>that his bow was taut. </p><p> “Make ready!” I nervously advised.</p><p> He grunted in disgust. All but half a</p><p>dozen of the horsemen began to pivot </p><p>on the left end of their line and, almost </p><p>before I could understand what they were </p><p>up to, this huge segment was galloping </p><p>madly along, parallel to the woods and </p><p>away from us. </p><p> “When night comes we shall ride very</p><p>swift or very soft,” mumbled Flat Mouth, </p><p>resuming the task of gathering arrows. </p><p> In short, the Sioux were perfectly willing</p><p>we should break from cover and ride south, </p><p>92 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> and left the six men to keep watch on us.</p><p>But if we attempted to ride north we must </p><p>pass through the bulk of their band. </p><p> Miss Dearness came up to us, and I told</p><p>her how the Sioux had thrown most of their </p><p>men to the other side of the grove. She </p><p>promptly said: </p><p> “It doesn’t make sense. If they didn’t</p><p>dare attack when all together what good </p><p>will it do them to divide their forces?” </p><p>“They will wait until dusk and creep in </p><p>from both sides-” </p><p> “And be shooting into each other,” she</p><p>shot in. </p><p> “Or stay'out on the plain and wait for us</p><p>to try and break through,” I concluded. </p><p> “But if they don’t dare attack in force</p><p>they must know we can stay here as long </p><p>as they can stay out there. We can creep </p><p>to the river and fish. We can make some </p><p>kind of a raft and cross, or float down- </p><p>stream. We can stay right here and eat </p><p>our horses. The rivulet furnishes water. </p><p>And there is a chance that some of our </p><p>Chippewas may come up the river and give </p><p>them battle. There’s more to it than a </p><p>waiting campaign. They’re anxious to </p><p>cage us up here until what? Whatever it is </p><p>the time will be short.” </p><p> She spoke in English and I translated</p><p>it to the Pillager. His small eyes sparkled </p><p>appreciatively and he declared: </p><p> “Medicine Hair sees beyond the woods</p><p>and hill. She can call and send away a </p><p>voice. She can send her eyes far up the </p><p>river and over the plain. Look! Tell me </p><p>what that means!” </p><p> He was pointing to the south and at first</p><p>I could make out nothing. Then I spied it, </p><p>a thin stream of blue smoke. The girl </p><p>promptly said in Chippewa: </p><p> “The Sioux know help is coming. They</p><p>will not attack until their friends come. </p><p>That will be some time before morning. </p><p>Soon the others will send up a smoke.”</p><p>The meaning of the smoke was very </p><p>obvious. Not a half-breed hunter, not a </p><p>man at any post in our department who </p><p>could not have read it. Even Probos </p><p>would have understood. Yet the Pillager, </p><p>a master at such things, heard her as if she </p><p>had been an oracle. </p><p> “Can the Medicine Hair’s eyes, when</p><p>she calls them back, tell how many Sioux </p><p>there are at the bottom of that smoke?” </p><p>he humbly asked. </p><p> “As many as were here before you killed</p><p> any,” she calmly replied. Then in English</p><p>to me: “It’s reasonable to believe they </p><p>belong to the same party and split up in </p><p>two equal bands. So long as he believes in </p><p>my manito, so much the braver will he be.” </p><p>The chief began talking to himself in a </p><p>guttural and almost audible voice and </p><p>fell to fingering his bow nervously. His </p><p>emotion was occasioned by the sight of the </p><p>six warriors out in front. They were </p><p>beyond arrow range, and only by luck could </p><p>a ball score any damage. </p><p> They began running back and forth,</p><p>and we saw they were heaping up dry grass. </p><p>They paid no attention to us, being intent </p><p>solely on answering the signal </p><p> With a leap the Pillager was on his horse</p><p>and riding towards them, his bow held with </p><p>arrow notched. He was not singing now, </p><p>and as if in a trance the girl and I watched </p><p>his progress. As the drama of the situation </p><p>got into our heads we instinctively clasped </p><p>hands. Back and forth scuttled the Sioux. </p><p>Forward rode the Pillager. Then one of </p><p>them chanced to discover him and, with </p><p>a shout of fear, turned and made for his </p><p>pony. I saw him go down with a Sioux </p><p>arrow buried to the feathers in his back. </p><p> With screams of rage the others snatched</p><p>up their weapons, opened fire and then </p><p>mounted their horses. With a whoop the </p><p>Pillager charged at them, and they sep- </p><p>arated in haste to let him pass through, </p><p>but, when a bit beyond the fallen warrior, </p><p>he brought his pony round on two hoofs </p><p>and was making for the timber, swinging </p><p>very low from the saddle as he rode. For </p><p>a moment the speed of his mount was </p><p>checked, then picked up a rattling pace, </p><p>and the chief was sitting erect, waved some-</p><p>thing round his head and sounded his ter- </p><p>rible scalp-cry. </p><p> “By heavens! But that was a coup</p><p>worth counting!” I fiercely exclaimed. </p><p>With a little shudder the girl reminded: </p><p>“They could have come through the </p><p>woods while we stood here. We’ve been </p><p>very careless and-” </p><p> She ceased abruptly and stared down at</p><p>our clasped hands. </p><p> I was as much surprized as she. Cer-</p><p>tainly I was no more conscious than she </p><p>of having taken her hand. It was three </p><p>years since I had taken a white woman’s </p><p>hand. In no way was the experience dis- </p><p>pleasing. </p><p> “He may need help,” she said, releasing</p><p>Gentlemen of the North </p><p>93 </p><p>her hand and looking toward the Pillager. </p><p> I leaped out in front with my gun, and</p><p>the warriors behind the Chippewa vanished </p><p>over the sides of their ponies and swung off </p><p>to the west. On rushed Flat Mouth, still </p><p>singing and shouting. But the climax of </p><p>his arrival was weakened by a puff of smoke </p><p>from a mound of grass. The signal fire </p><p>was burning, and the Indians were heaping </p><p>wet grass and green branches upon it. </p><p> Leaving the two to watch the smoke,</p><p>I hastened to the north side of the grove. </p><p>Had the enemy but known it he could </p><p>have massacred the girl and me easily, as </p><p>we watched the Pillager’s sensational ex- </p><p>ploit. When I came to the end of the </p><p>growth I noted the Sioux had heard the </p><p>Chippewa’s scalp-yell and were very un- </p><p>easy. They were riding back and forth, </p><p>their eyes fixed on the timber, while one of </p><p>their number was galloping madly toward </p><p>the tip of the grove to learn what had </p><p>happened. After watching them for a </p><p>minute and failing to detect any sign of </p><p>an advance on our position, I returned to </p><p>my companions and related what I had </p><p>observed. </p><p> “The name of Eshkebugecoshe fills the</p><p>Sioux hearts with fear. It makes them </p><p>old women,” loudly boasted the chief. </p><p> “It was a big coup,” I declared. “You</p><p>may paint the marks of death and the </p><p>feet of horses on your body and on your </p><p>tent to show you killed a man while riding </p><p>hard.” </p><p>The chief toned down his vanity on </p><p>meeting the girl’s clear gaze and confessed: </p><p> “Eshkebugecoshe is a mighty warrior,</p><p>but the white woman’s medicine helped </p><p>him. It made the Sioux blind till I could </p><p>creep very close.” </p><p> “Couldn’t we get across the river? I</p><p>can swim,” eagerly spoke up Miss Dear- </p><p>ness. </p><p> FLAT MOUTH said it would be</p><p>y| foolish to cross before dark, but </p><p>he suggested that I reconnoiter</p><p>the river while he watched the Indians. </p><p>He did not seem to think much of the </p><p>suggestion, but as it came from the girl </p><p>he was bound to consider it, probably </p><p>believing her medicine suggested the </p><p>plan. I thought very favorably of the </p><p>idea. The Indians’ belief that we planned </p><p>to use the ponies in attempting to escape </p><p>would tend to blunt their watch of the river. </p><p> I followed the rivulet until I came to</p><p>its mouth, a bit of a beach grown round </p><p>with reeds and tall grass. The river rolled </p><p>brown and silent except for the murmuring </p><p>of air currents. Mid-stream a huge tree </p><p>floated with roots upraised, like arms held </p><p>up in surrender—desolation and solitude. </p><p>As I watched the water I decided a man </p><p>could well risk the danger. A long swim </p><p>under water, timed to take advantage of </p><p>some of the driftwood ever passing, and </p><p>the trick could be turned. But the water </p><p>was icy cold and the danger was not for a </p><p>woman to run unless absolutely necessary. </p><p> Yet at night, with the aid of a log, Miss</p><p>Dearness could be ferried across. I began </p><p>to look about for some fallen timber which </p><p>would serve as a raft. It was while occu- </p><p>pied in this task that I received ample </p><p>proof that the Sioux had not forgotten the </p><p>river. The proof was an arrow which </p><p>whizzed by my head and disappeared in </p><p>the reeds. I drew back among the trees </p><p>and, cocking my gun, searched the top of </p><p>the bank. I could see nothing suspicious, </p><p>yet a savage could remain below the bank </p><p>with the top of his head masked by the </p><p>fringe of dead grass. Thus concealed, he </p><p>could follow my every movement and loose </p><p>another arrow when I presented a fair </p><p>target. </p><p> The thought made me uncomfortable,</p><p>and I retreated deeper into the grove. A </p><p>mocking yell told me that my flight had </p><p>been witnessed, and, incensed, I turned </p><p>back, determined to get a shot at him. </p><p>The rascal was too cunning in his hiding, </p><p>so, returning to my companions, I reported </p><p>the incident. </p><p> Flat Mouth slipped out of his white</p><p>robes and without a word stole to the </p><p>river to match his woodcraft against the </p><p>sentinel’s. As he had reported that the </p><p>Sioux on the north side of the timber were </p><p>quiet, and as no danger could take the</p><p>girl unaware from the south side, I sur- </p><p>rendered to my desire and followed him. </p><p> Armed only with his bow and arrow</p><p>he slipped through the growth with the </p><p>softness of a lynx, following my trail along </p><p>the rivulet. Keeping well back, I watched </p><p>him. He was studying my tracks rather </p><p>than looking about for the enemy. He </p><p>halted a short distance from where I had </p><p>stood in the open when the arrow missed </p><p>me, then glided to the edge of the reeds </p><p>and, bending low, pulled an arrow from the </p><p>94 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>muck. As he straightened I saw his arm </p><p>twitch and a red blotch appear on the </p><p>biceps. Leaping to one side, he fitted the </p><p>arrow to his bow, gave a keen, sweeping </p><p>glance overhead and discharged the arrow. </p><p>Almost with the twang of the bow there </p><p>came the shrill death-cry from the sentinel </p><p>and I saw a dark body bump down along </p><p>the trunk of an oak and lodge against one </p><p>of its branches. </p><p> Gliding back to me, the Pillager an-</p><p>nounced: </p><p> “Sometime I will climb up and get his</p><p>hair. The arrow in the mud showed that </p><p>it came from overhead and not from the </p><p>bank.” </p><p> With this explanation he registered the</p><p>kill with his terrible war-cry. </p><p> We hastened back through the grove,</p><p>the Pillager swinging to the north to recon- </p><p>noiter, while I made direct for Miss Dear- </p><p>ness. She had heard the two cries, one of </p><p>death and one of victory, and stood facing </p><p>the river, her hands twisted together, her </p><p>face white and drawn. On beholding me </p><p>she hastily turned toward the plain and </p><p>her hands fell listlessly to her side. </p><p> The column of smoke had replied to the</p><p>message from the south and was now </p><p>dying out. She informed that while I had </p><p>been gone the Indians had used their robes </p><p>to coafine the smoke and then released it </p><p>in puffs. Had the Pillager witnessed it he </p><p>could have read the code. However it </p><p>was not difficult to guess the message; it </p><p>told those in the south to hasten if they </p><p>would be in at a triple kill. </p><p> Until now I had had no chance to ex-</p><p>change more than a few words with Miss </p><p>Dearness. She gestured for me to sit beside </p><p>her on the robes, and I took the oppor- </p><p>tunity to say: </p><p> “You should have started back East the</p><p>minute you heard your father was dead.” </p><p> “I told him I would stay till some one</p><p>came to take his place.” </p><p> “But it’s no place for a white woman,”</p><p>I protested. “It’s bad enough for a man </p><p>to be cast away among these savages.” </p><p> She smiled faintly and reminded—</p><p> “The only danger I’ve faced—until to-</p><p>day—was from a white man, Black </p><p>Chabot.” </p><p> “I wish the Robe had hit him with his</p><p>arrows.” </p><p> “I told the Robe to be very careful and</p><p>not hit him, the drunken beast!” </p><p> “If we could only get word to my Chip-</p><p>pewas,” I sighed. </p><p> “It would do no good so long as I am</p><p>with you,” she discouraged. Then with </p><p>a grim little laugh: “I’m bad luck. If you </p><p>were alone they would come; but not while </p><p>I’m with you. They believe I stole the </p><p>voice from the Qu’ Appelle or that my </p><p>medicine wasn’t strong enough to keep it. </p><p>If I hadn’t sent the voice back they would </p><p>dare anything to help me.” </p><p> “Then the Crees and Assiniboins?”</p><p> “They’ve heard the Chippewas tell that</p><p>my medicine is weak. Now they believe </p><p>I would have kept the Voice if I could. </p><p>They feel no gratitude. It would be as </p><p>dangerous for me to meet Cree or Assiniboin </p><p>away from the post as it has been to meet </p><p>the Sioux.” </p><p> “Nonsense!” I scoffed. “They’re afraid</p><p>of you, even if they don’t like your medi- </p><p>cine.” </p><p> “They hate me and they don’t fear me.</p><p>When I went on the river alone at night </p><p>and sang to forget my loneliness I little </p><p>knew what I was stirring up. I went to </p><p>get away from the drinking and fighting. </p><p>I sang, as I was always singing back in the </p><p>East.” </p><p> “But the Assiniboins would listen to me,”</p><p>I proudly insisted. </p><p> “Mr. Franklin, you don’t know them.</p><p>You’ve met those that come to your post. </p><p>Their territory extends far to the west. </p><p>They’re a mighty people. You’ve met</p><p>men from one band only. Meet them </p><p>away from your fort and your rum and you </p><p>will find they’re very much savages.” </p><p>A HORSEMAN suddenly darted </p><p>toward us, his bow drawn, seeking </p><p>to learn if we were keeping watch. </p><p>I covered his bobbing figure as best I could </p><p>and held my fire until he should come with- </p><p>in decent range. Just as I began to hope, </p><p>he pulled his pony about and scuttled back </p><p>to his mates. </p><p> “Who are you? Where were you bom?”</p><p>I asked, lowering my gun. </p><p> “English—England,” she murmured, her</p><p>gaze wandering far beyond the wild </p><p>horizon. </p><p> “And I’m an American. Flat Mouth</p><p>thinks your hair is medicine.” </p><p> With a little frown she gathered up the</p><p>disheveled mass and, before my eyes, per- </p><p>formed the miracle of restoring her hair </p><p>Gentlemen of the North </p><p>95 </p><p>to glossy smoothness by the simple process </p><p>of patting, twisting and poking. Stay out </p><p>in the Northwest for three seasons and you </p><p>will appreciate how keenly this simple task </p><p>appeals to a white man. </p><p> She faced me suddenly, her blue eyes</p><p>prying deep into mine, and abruptly </p><p>asked— </p><p> “Why do you look at me like that?”</p><p> “Like what?” I defended.</p><p> “As if you had never seen a woman</p><p>before.” </p><p> “I haven’t seen a white woman for three</p><p>seasons,” I sighed. </p><p> “I understand.” And she turned to</p><p>resume her watch of the Indians. </p><p> “A white woman even if she be as</p><p>ignorant and unattractive as a scullery </p><p>maid would seem a goddess to you now.” </p><p>“Scarcely that,” I demurred. “Three </p><p>years out here is a long time, but not an </p><p>eternity. I never dream of scullery </p><p>maids. I-” </p><p> Her grave reproachful gaze caused me</p><p>to shift and ask— </p><p> “You’ll be willing to start back east after</p><p>you get out of this?” </p><p> “When my successor comes. The X. Y.</p><p>people allow nothing to interfere with the </p><p>interests of the company.” </p><p> “Except rum,” I reminded.</p><p> “That was my whim. The company</p><p>will disapprove. My defense will be that </p><p>the drinking made it dangerous for me. </p><p>They will let it go at that. The com- </p><p>panies know liquor is bad for the trade. </p><p>If it weren’t for competition they wouldn’t </p><p>use it. It isn’t sound business. You must </p><p>depend entirely upon the Indians to get </p><p>furs into the posts. The richest fur country </p><p>in the world would be worthless unless </p><p>you had Indians to work it. Then where </p><p>is the sense in killing off your workmen</p><p>with rum? Every drinking match means </p><p>so many wounded and usually one or more </p><p>dead. It’s bad enough when the quarrels </p><p>are kept within one tribe, but let a Chip- </p><p>pewa stab a Cree, or a Cree an Assiniboin, </p><p>and you have a season of war between the </p><p>two tribes, and no trade. Except when </p><p>fighting an opposition the Hudson’s Bay </p><p>Company is very careful about giving out </p><p>liquor. So would the X. Y. and the N. W. </p><p>be if either could have all the trade.” </p><p> “If the N. W. and the opposition posts</p><p>should shut down on rum tomorrow you’d </p><p>find these Indians hunting for some free </p><p>trader to give rum for their goods. They </p><p>will travel any distance to get new ‘milk.’ </p><p>They will have rum and we must have the </p><p>furs. There is no other way.” </p><p> “Oh yes, there is,” she murmured. “Give</p><p>one company a monopoly of the trade, </p><p>and the furs will come in and no rum will </p><p>go out.” </p><p> “But which company? The N. W.?</p><p>Then I agree with all my heart.” </p><p> “The companies should combine into one.</p><p>No company would refuse if it knew a </p><p>monopoly was to be granted.” </p><p> She became silent and I was satisfied</p><p>to study her profile. During the stress </p><p>of fighting and retreating I had defended </p><p>her from a sense of duty. The puzzling </p><p>and disturbing emotions which had driven </p><p>me up the river to find her had abated. </p><p>From the moment we met in the woods, </p><p>and I learned my work was cut out for </p><p>me she became quite impersonal, some- </p><p>thing to be saved. The Pillager placed </p><p>her on a pedestal and looked on her as </p><p>mighty medicine because of her hair. </p><p> Now that I took time to study her she</p><p>became a personality again, to be pro- </p><p>tected differently than one protects a pack </p><p>of beaver. This knowledge was borne in </p><p>upon me after I had decided she was very </p><p>tired. Weariness suggests weakness. The </p><p>strain had told on her and this fact human- </p><p>ized her. I began to pity her. I was </p><p>guilty of feeling glad she was weary, for </p><p>it proved that she was no superwoman. </p><p> I arranged a robe at the foot of an oak</p><p>between two huge roots and asked her to </p><p>lie there and rest. At first she dismissed </p><p>the suggestion with an impatient shake of </p><p>the head, then abruptly changed her mind </p><p>and made herself comfortable. I remained </p><p>behind the bushes watching the enemy. </p><p>Inside of five minuted her deep and regular </p><p>breathing told me she was asleep. </p><p> I turned and looked at her and found</p><p>the masculine resolution which had char- </p><p>acterized her face was replaced by woman- </p><p>liness. She held a new interest for me, </p><p>and I wondered if, when back east, she was </p><p>not always like this, relaxed and soft and </p><p>winsome. She was half reclining, half </p><p>sitting, with her head and shoulders </p><p>against the oak, and as I gazed, her head </p><p>sank to one side and I feared she would </p><p>lean too far and lose her balance. I sat </p><p>beside her, and her head rested on my </p><p>shoulder. </p><p>96 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Thus we sat while the sun sped along on</p><p>its eternal errand. Thus we sat when a </p><p>Sioux vidette galloped slowly toward the </p><p>grove with the intention of counting coup </p><p>by coming very close. Through the lace </p><p>work of willow branches I could see the </p><p>scoundrel plainly, although remaining un- </p><p>seen by him. </p><p> As the girl had her head pillowed on my</p><p>right shoulder I raised my gun with my </p><p>left hand. Even when thus handicapped </p><p>I knew I could pot him if he should come </p><p>up a bit closer. He wavered, almost halted </p><p>and stabbed his suspicious glances up and </p><p>down the front of our shelter, then directed </p><p>his horse well within easy range. I had </p><p>him, only the explosion of the piece would </p><p>have startled the girl. I held my fire. </p><p>Something suddenly alarmed him, and he </p><p>yanked his pony about and rode frantically </p><p>back to his mates. Arrows began pursuing </p><p>him, three in the air at a time, and I knew </p><p>the Pillager was back from his trip of dis- </p><p>covery. The arrows did no damage, and </p><p>the man escaped. </p><p> Then the Pillager burst through the</p><p>undergrowth, his face distorted with fear. </p><p>On beholding us he grunted in deep disgust, </p><p>yet looked much relieved. Finding the </p><p>savage so close without any action on my </p><p>part, he assumed we had been butchered. </p><p>The girl stirred and opened her blue eyes. </p><p>For a few moments she remained with her </p><p>head on my shoulder, her eyes slightly </p><p>dazed as sleep still lingered. Then a red </p><p>tide spread to her neck and she drew back </p><p>against the tree trunk. </p><p> “You could have killed him!” Flat</p><p>Mouth was accusing. </p><p> “The range was long,” I protested.</p><p> “You could have killed him,” insisted</p><p>the chief. “The Medicine Hair slept on </p><p>your shoulder, or we would have now one </p><p>more dead Sioux.” </p><p> The girl understood. Her manner was</p><p>gentle as she asked— </p><p> “You didn’t fire because of me?”</p><p> “You were sleeping nicely. You needed</p><p>rest. Tonight will be very hard on you. </p><p>Besides, the chief is mistaken. The war- </p><p>rior was too far away.” </p><p> Flat Mouth easily followed my disclaimer</p><p>and with a grunt cried: </p><p> “Let the Medicine Hair see how far away</p><p>the Sioux dog was.” </p><p> Before I could stop him he was running</p><p>out on the plain. The horsemen pranced </p><p>about, undecided whether to drive him </p><p>back or await developments. Possibly they </p><p>believed he was insane. He stopped, stuck </p><p>an arrow into the earth and loudly called: </p><p>“Here, white woman, is where the dog </p><p>turned his horse. Is it long range?” </p><p>“Almost an easy pistol-shot,” she mur- </p><p>mured. “You shouldn’t have minded me.” </p><p>“But I do mind you,” I assured. “Be- </p><p>sides, one more dead won’t save us. Others </p><p>will be arriving before night. Shooting </p><p>won’t get us clear. We must depend on </p><p>the darkness.” </p><p> “You think we can break through?” she</p><p>wistfully asked. </p><p> “We will sneak through,” I answered,</p><p>renewing my pity for her as I more fully </p><p>realized how she had stood face to face </p><p>with death ever since discovered by the </p><p>Sioux. </p><p> The Pillager and I had the stimulus of</p><p>battle to hold us up to the mark. She </p><p>must await the verdict and, if it be adverse, </p><p>kill herself or die a thousand deaths. </p><p> “I suppose it depends on whether the</p><p>Sioux up the river arrive before or after </p><p>dark,” she murmured. </p><p> “It will be dark before they arrive,”</p><p>I comforted. </p><p> I was horribly afraid. The Sioux would</p><p>make all haste on reading the smoke which </p><p>told of three victims—one a woman— </p><p>awaiting capture. I believed they would </p><p>arrive before night. Did they do this we </p><p>must stand an attack in force and go down </p><p>fighting. I prayed for a storm to spoil </p><p>their bow-strings and leave my gun master </p><p>of the situation, but the wind continued</p><p>strong from the south, and there was no </p><p>hint of rain in the sky. </p><p> Had it been a case of the Pillager and</p><p>myself we would have taken to the river, </p><p>trusting to reach the opposite bank and </p><p>find a hiding place in the thickly timbered </p><p>country. By separating, one of us would </p><p>stand some chance of escaping. Together </p><p>with the girl it would be a miracle if we </p><p>could conceal ourselves even if we reached </p><p>the other bank of the river. Only a black </p><p>night would reduce the advantage of mere </p><p>numbers. </p><p>OCK) FLAT MOUTH came up to us, </p><p>turned on his heel and retired into </p><p>the timber. I endeavored to engage </p><p>him in conversation but he would not talk. </p><p>The girl said his silence meant he had lost </p><p>Gentlemen of the North </p><p>97 </p><p>hope, that he believed the enemy would </p><p>receive reinforcements before night. I </p><p>insisted he was still angry because I had </p><p>not shot at the Sioux while she slept on </p><p>my shoulder. Then we sat side by side, </p><p>trying to conceal from each other our </p><p>anxiety, as we watched the sun and kept </p><p>an eye on the few Indians. They too </p><p>seemed more interested in the upper </p><p>reaches of the Red than in us. Like our- </p><p>selves they were watching for the coming </p><p>of their tribesmen. </p><p> The sun was all but lost behind the</p><p>western rim, and the long shadows cast </p><p>by the Indians in front of us would soon </p><p>fade with the twilight. Now the race </p><p>between the red scoundrels and the sun </p><p>was almost run, my heart began jumping </p><p>most erratically. The girl seemed lost in a </p><p>reverie, so I left her to see what was going </p><p>on north of the timber. </p><p> The Indians were dismounted and</p><p>stretched across the plain to prevent our </p><p>making a break. There were no shadows </p><p>now, and the light had perceptibly dimmed. </p><p>I knew how quickly the light fled in these </p><p>vast areas of loneliness, once the sun gave </p><p>up the fight. Only a few minutes more </p><p>and we would hope for the best. A warrior </p><p>sprang to his feet and stared toward the </p><p>river. I believed he had glimpsed the </p><p>Pillager. He said something, and other </p><p>warriors stood up, one even standing on his </p><p>horse. </p><p> Then came a high pitched call from the</p><p>river. With an extravagant display of </p><p>joy they answered the call, sprang to their </p><p>ponies and began riding back and forth. </p><p>From the other side of the timber came a </p><p>yelping chorus. </p><p> “Mr. Franklin! Mr. Franklin!” called</p><p>the bell-like voice of Miss Dearness. </p><p> I ran back, much alarmed, and found</p><p>she had come as far as the rivulet in search </p><p>of me. </p><p> “They’re coming!” she said.</p><p> I raced to the edge of the woods and</p><p>beheld them, riding far apart, waving</p><p>their weapons and shouting their war-songs </p><p>as they slowly cantered towards us. Drop- </p><p>ping on one knee, I covered the man riding </p><p>in advance of the line whose elaborate head- </p><p>dress marked him as the bearer of the pipe </p><p>on this expedition. I sent a ball through </p><p>his chest most neatly, and as his spirit fled </p><p>tn the land of many lodges his followers </p><p>came to a confused halt. I fired again, </p><p>this time knocking a man half round in </p><p>his saddle but not dismounting him. In- </p><p>stantly the survivors scurried back. As </p><p>I was reloading Flat Mouth came through </p><p>the bushes and motioned for me to follow </p><p>him. I hesitated to leave the girl, but she </p><p>urged: </p><p> “Go! They’ve learned their lesson.</p><p>They’ll keep back.” </p><p> Flat Mouth hurried diagonally across</p><p>the timber and emerged on the lower </p><p>edge near the river. Drawing me down </p><p>beside him, he pointed to the east bank </p><p>and grunted— </p><p> “Sioux!”</p><p> “I heard their signal,” I informed him.</p><p>“They came down the river on the other </p><p>side. When it gets very dark they will </p><p>bring their horses over. They heard your </p><p>gun and they don’t want to try it just now.” </p><p>“When they cross we can not break </p><p>through,” I said. </p><p> “We will all be killed if we stay in the</p><p>woods. You must stop them from crossing </p><p>their horses for a little while. The Sioux </p><p>on this side feel sure of a coup. They will </p><p>not fight till their friends join them. Stay </p><p>here till it gets too dark to shoot. I will </p><p>take Medicine Hair and the horses to the </p><p>end of the timber. When they attack on </p><p>both sides we must ride after the sun.” </p><p>“West?” </p><p> “It leads from home but it is the nearest</p><p>way there. We can strike* the Cheyenne </p><p>near the Lac du Diable country. There </p><p>are many good hiding places there.” </p><p> The bushes across the river swayed and</p><p>a painted face showed through the dusk </p><p>as one of the newcomers stood up to signal </p><p>the horsemen on our side. Knowing I </p><p>could not begin too soon to teach them</p><p>their place, I rested the gun on Flat </p><p>Mouth’s shoulder, aimed a bit high and </p><p>had the satisfaction of seeing the brave go </p><p>sprawling down the bank, his head and </p><p>shoulders remaining under water. This </p><p>kill wrung a chorus of devilish yells from the </p><p>hidden warriors. Flat Mouth hurled his </p><p>war-cry at them and danced in great glee. </p><p> I reloaded and urged the Pillager to</p><p>return to the girl and prepare her for making </p><p>the tip of the grove. Reluctantly he left </p><p>me, swinging to the north to take a final </p><p>look at the horsemen there, and I settled </p><p>down to waiting. </p><p> Objects began to fade out of my vision.</p><p>Trees near by became blurred and unreal. </p><p>98 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>I knew our supreme effort could not be long </p><p>delayed. The surface of the water became </p><p>a black waste, and I thought I heard a faint </p><p>splash opposite my position. Now voices </p><p>began calhng loudly farther down the river. </p><p>The newcomers had gone to find a crossing. </p><p>I could see no reason why I should not put </p><p>after the chief and the girl; then the .soft </p><p>splashing was repeated, this time nearer. </p><p> Quitting the bushes, I crawled through</p><p>the mud to the edge of the bank and heard </p><p>a rippling sound that was not made by the </p><p>lap-lap of the water on the narrow beach. </p><p>Suddenly a vague shape stood before me, </p><p>within twenty feel, and I fired. He did </p><p>not have time to utter his death cry before </p><p>slumping back into the current. Trailing </p><p>my gun, I ducked into the woods and fol- </p><p>lowed up the rivulet. </p><p> The Pillager and Miss Dearness were</p><p>about half-way to the end of the timber </p><p>when I overtook them. It seems she had </p><p>refused to go further until I joined them. </p><p> “Take her and go on,” viciously directed</p><p>Flat Mouth, thrusting the bridles of the </p><p>three horses into my hands. </p><p> “No time for you to count a coup,”</p><p>I warned as he turned back. </p><p> “Very soon I shall be at your heels,” he</p><p>promised. </p><p> Our progress was slow because of the</p><p>difficulty in avoiding the frequent clumps </p><p>of willows. From the plain on the north </p><p>came the sound of much singing. From </p><p>the south the Indians were racing their </p><p>horses impudently near the woods and </p><p>yelling derisively. I gave the girl the </p><p>bridles to hold while I recharged my gun. </p><p>We had nearly reached the end of our cover, </p><p>and the underbrush was thinning out, when </p><p>the girl caught my hand and whispered— </p><p> “They’re trying to burn us out!”</p><p> I sniffed and detected smoke, a thin reek</p><p>of burning grass. I wet my finger and </p><p>tested the faint breeze. It still held from </p><p>the south. Creeping to the edge of the </p><p>plain I could make out moving shapes as</p><p>the Indians rode up and down the front </p><p>of the timber. But there were no fires </p><p>burning on this side, and a blaze lighted </p><p>on the north would sweep away from </p><p>us. </p><p> Returning to Miss Dearness, I reassured</p><p>her. </p><p> “Then there is only one other explana-</p><p>tion,” she said. “Flat Mouth has set the </p><p>grass afire on the north side of us.” </p><p> “It will bum to the Turtle, perhaps to</p><p>the Park.” </p><p> “Some one is coming!” she warned, and</p><p>again her hand instinctively closed over </p><p>mine. </p><p> I cocked the gun and rested it over a</p><p>saddle, not bothering to release my hand. </p><p> “It is Eshkebugecoshe,” softly called a</p><p>voice. </p><p> The girl dropped my hand hurriedly.</p><p>Without pausing, Flat Mouth took charge </p><p>of the horses and pressed ahead while I </p><p>guarded the rear. Now the smoke was </p><p>very noticeable and our animals showed a </p><p>tendency to bolt. </p><p> “You fired the grass?” I whispered.</p><p> “In many places,” he grunted. “The</p><p>Sioux are spreading out and watching for </p><p>us to ride through under cover of the smoke. </p><p>The warriors on the other side will think </p><p>we’re escaping and will ride into the woods.” </p><p>We were at the end of the timber, and </p><p>the girl mounted her pony and adjusted </p><p>her white robe. </p><p> Dead ahead. sounded the pounding of</p><p>hoofs and an Indian screamed something. </p><p>Flat Mouth interpreted: </p><p> “He says for the men to ride through the</p><p>woods, some to go to the river, some to </p><p>come up here, some to follow the fire and </p><p>see if we are there, some to keep in front </p><p>of it. Wait for me here and do not fire the </p><p>gun unless you have to.” </p><p> Before we could restrain him he was</p><p>galloping toward the messenger, his white </p><p>robe making him resemble a Sioux warrior</p><p>whose skins were white with clay. I heard </p><p>him salute the Sioux in that tongue. The </p><p>other asked something in a sharp, insistent </p><p>voice. The next moment there was the </p><p>blurr of a struggle, then the clump of a </p><p>falling body. A horseman was riding </p><p>toward me. I cocked my piece, but Flat </p><p>Mouth softly commanded: </p><p> “Hurry! Hurry!”</p><p> Then he took the girl’s pony by the halter</p><p>and led the way out into the plain. </p><p>CHAPTER VIH </p><p>WE MEET BLACK CAT’S PEOPLE </p><p>ON OUR left the warriors were entering </p><p>the woods. On our right they were </p><p>riding their ponies through the fire to find </p><p>us behind the smoke. Had it been Autumn </p><p>there would have been no passing the </p><p>Gentlemen of the North </p><p>99 </p><p>flames, but with the short stubble sprinkled </p><p>with the new grass trying to gain the sun, </p><p>and with the ground still wet, there was no </p><p>danger. The smoke, the night and the </p><p>shouting brought much confusion to the </p><p>enemy. Away from it all we rode, the girl </p><p>and the Pillager in advance, and I scamper- </p><p>ing behind with my two barrels ready. </p><p> Our escape must have been quickly dis-</p><p>covered, as we had not traveled more than </p><p>two miles before we heard shouting to-the </p><p>north and abreast of us. We slowed our </p><p>animals to a walk, our course tending a bit </p><p>south of west and which, if persisted in, </p><p>would bring us to the Cheyenne River. </p><p>The Sioux knew we were somewhere south </p><p>of them and were concentrating all their </p><p>efforts in throwing a barrier across the </p><p>plains to prevent our turning north towards </p><p>the Pembina. </p><p> I rode up beside the girl. She reached</p><p>out, patted my arm and said— </p><p> “I’ve made you a lot of bother.”</p><p> “Life out here is made up of bothers.</p><p>I’m glad to find one that’s worth while.” </p><p>“You say it very nicely,” she approved. </p><p>“But I won’t be a bother to any one again </p><p>if I can get out of this. So long as I could </p><p>manage without being helped it was my </p><p>place to stay. Now that I find I have to </p><p>shift my responsibilities I am anxious to go </p><p>back east. I never had believed it, but I </p><p>do now; a woman is sure to need help </p><p>sometime.” </p><p> “She wouldn’t be a woman if she didn’t,”</p><p>I declared. “Even men expect to help </p><p>each other in this country.” </p><p> “He doesn’t have to ask another to see</p><p>to it he isn't taken prisoner,” she gravely </p><p>replied. “I had no right to ask you. An- </p><p>other example of dodging responsibilities.” </p><p>“God forbid it should ever have to be!” </p><p>“But you wouldn’t let them take me </p><p>alive?” she fiercely demanded. </p><p> “No man would,” I answered.</p><p> Again she patted my arm and mur-</p><p>mured—</p><p> “If we had met back East we might have</p><p>been such friends.” </p><p> The wind whipped a strand of her hair</p><p>across my face, and in that moment she </p><p>was all feminine—dependent, and her pres- </p><p>ence became a tonic. I was saved from </p><p>replying to her last speech—a foolish speech, </p><p>as there was nothing to prevent our being </p><p>“such friends” out here—by a warning hiss </p><p>from the Pillager. </p><p> He leaped to the ground and ordered us</p><p>to do likewise. I helped the girl to dis- </p><p>mount, and the chief caught her pony by </p><p>the nose to keep him from giving an alarm, </p><p>while I muzzled my own beast and waited. </p><p>A thudding of hoofs, not more than four </p><p>men, as the Pillager whispered, drew </p><p>nearer. They were bearing directly down </p><p>on us, and I was anxious to release my </p><p>animal and make ready to fire. Flat </p><p>Mouth warned: </p><p> “Be still! See that the horse doesn’t</p><p>call out. They can’t see us.” </p><p> I knew this must be true, as we could</p><p>see nothing of them. On they came and </p><p>raced by in front of us and very close— </p><p>a suggestion of motion as if something had </p><p>disturbed the darkness and left a swirl </p><p>of darkness behind it. These were spies </p><p>sent out to learn our true position. Above </p><p>us on the right the enemy kept calling back </p><p>and forth as they patrolled from east to </p><p>west. Still on foot, we resumed our flight, </p><p>the chief picking his course without any </p><p>hesitation. I suggested the necessity of a </p><p>turning movement before daylight, but he </p><p>discouraged it, saying: </p><p> “We must keep this way till light. Then</p><p>we must hide. This is a big war-party. </p><p>It will be ashamed to go back and face the </p><p>women without scalps to pay for the braves </p><p>we have killed. These are the Sioux of </p><p>the plains, very cruel and fierce. Once </p><p>they held the country along the lower Red </p><p>River. They are always at war with the </p><p>Chippewas.” </p><p> “For just where are we striking?”</p><p> “The bend of the Cheyenne. It is very</p><p>rough and heavily wooded along the river. </p><p>The Sioux claim the country. We can</p><p>hide there a few days and then go home.” </p><p>From what he said I judged the distance </p><p>to be covered was about forty miles. I </p><p>know that we rode and walked all night </p><p>long with the Sioux hovering to the north </p><p>of us during much of the journey. When </p><p>the east began lighting its fires, and we were </p><p>permitted to see the plain around us, I was </p><p>delighted by two discoveries; the plain </p><p>was empty of Indians, and a short distance </p><p>ahead a thick growth marked the course </p><p>of the Cheyenne where it made its northern </p><p>loop. </p><p> The girl swayed in her saddle, and I rode</p><p>closer to her. </p><p> “I was asleep,” she drowsily murmured,</p><p>leaning against my arm. “Dreamed the </p><p>100 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Indians had captured me, that you came.” </p><p> Again her head dropped, and it was a</p><p>long time before I learned of the heroics I </p><p>played in that particular dream. </p><p> Flat Mouth led the way into the growth,</p><p>going ahead to make sure no grizzlies were </p><p>waiting to pounce upon our horses. After </p><p>securely hobbling the animals so they </p><p>could not escape, he disappeared in the </p><p>direction of the river which flowed unseen </p><p>near-by. I spread out the skin and three </p><p>of the robes and induced the girl to lie down. </p><p>Then I placed the remaining robes over her </p><p>to keep out the morning chill and promised </p><p>to call her for breakfast. </p><p> .Searching the edge of the growth, I col-</p><p>lected an armful of dry sticks which I knew </p><p>would not smoke, and by the time I had </p><p>done this Flat Mouth appeared with several </p><p>wild geese. He attended to the cooking, </p><p>making a fire so small as to seem ridiculous </p><p>to a white man. As he broiled the fowl he </p><p>told me the trees were ripped and seamed </p><p>by bears’ claws and that both banks of the </p><p>river must be teeming with the animals. </p><p>I had nothing but contempt for the black </p><p>and brown varieties, knowing them to be </p><p>harmless, but the grizzly was a different </p><p>proposition. Flat Mouth insisted, how- </p><p>ever, that these seldom attacked unless </p><p>cornered or wounded. </p><p> The girl woke up, and, after she had</p><p>eaten, the chief and I stuffed ourselves. </p><p>Then he insisted that we try to get some </p><p>sleep. The sun was half-way through its </p><p>day’s work when I opened my eyes. The </p><p>girl was seated with her back to a tree, </p><p>her hair a marvel of neatness. She had </p><p>thrown a robe over me, and this little act, </p><p>so meaningless to those never initiated into </p><p>the wilds, affected me strangely. It was </p><p>the first time in many years that any one </p><p>had taken thought for my comfort; cer- </p><p>tainly the first wherein a woman had given </p><p>me any attention since I was a child in the </p><p>States and under my mother’s care. My </p><p>first sensation was that of being “moth- </p><p>ered.” I liked it. All men do, let them </p><p>disclaim to the contrary as they will. </p><p> I half closed my eyes and for several</p><p>minutes pretended to be asleep, that I might </p><p>watch her. Her blue eyes were serene; </p><p>her fine features were softened by repose. </p><p>Here, in a position of great danger, she </p><p>impressed me as revealing her true self, </p><p>her genuine womanliness. At the X. Y. </p><p>post, where no physical harm could intrude, </p><p>she had been cold, hard and unapproach- </p><p>able. </p><p> At last she caught me spying and colored</p><p>furiously, instinctively feeling of her hair. </p><p> “Where is the chief?” I innocently asked.</p><p> She pointed, and I arose and beheld him</p><p>sleeping, lying on his face. When I stepped </p><p>toward him he came to his senses and </p><p>sprang to his feet like a wildcat. Our </p><p>voices had not disturbed him but my step </p><p>had. Subconsciously, perhaps, he had cata- </p><p>logued our voices, but a stealthy step was </p><p>not so easily classified. He always insisted a </p><p>person woke up more easily and more com- </p><p>pletely—woke up all over as he expressed </p><p>it—if he slept on his face. The girl insisted </p><p>that he finish out his nap, but he replied he </p><p>was “filled” with sleep and would need no </p><p>more till another day. </p><p> The girl said that during our slumbers</p><p>there had been no signs of life on the plain </p><p>except the buffalo and their lurking escort </p><p>of gray wolves. She had heard sounds </p><p>back in the woods, and once a red deer </p><p>had poked his head through the bushes to </p><p>look us over. </p><p> I went with Flat'Mouth to the river,</p><p>where he fashioned several drinking-dishes </p><p>out of bark, and while there we saw seven </p><p>grizzlies descend the opposite shore to </p><p>drink. They were huge brutes and more </p><p>to be feared than the Sioux, should they </p><p>take a notion to attack. The Pillager ob- </p><p>served them unconcernedly, however, as- </p><p>suring me that they would not bother us </p><p>if we did not trouble them. </p><p> The river, he reminded, was seldom</p><p>visited by Assiniboin, Cree or Chippewa </p><p>because die Sioux claimed it. From fear </p><p>of attacks from the northern Indians, the </p><p>Sioux, in turn, seldom came there except </p><p>in war strength. So all animal life had </p><p>been left to develop undisturbed by man. </p><p>The bears had not been hunted and did</p><p>not know man as a destroyer. This was </p><p>all very comforting as long as I could believe </p><p>it, but the thought of the girl back in the </p><p>little glade alone, with these monsters </p><p>wandering about in batches of seven, </p><p>made me anxious to return. </p><p> We took water to her and on the way</p><p>started up red deer which were nowhere </p><p>near as shy as those on the Red River. </p><p>Leaving her again, we visited the horses </p><p>and found them contentedly grazing inside </p><p>the fringe of bushes and willows. Leaving </p><p>the chief with them, I rejoined the girl. </p><p>Gentlemen of the North </p><p>IOI </p><p>“MUST we wait until night before </p><p>starting home?” she eagerly asked. </p><p>“I believe that is the chief’s idea. </p><p>He knows the country and the Indians far </p><p>better than we do. We must take no </p><p>foolish risks.” </p><p> “If you were alone would you start now?”</p><p>she asked. </p><p>In truth I should have, but I said nothing. </p><p>“Then pretend I’m a man. Let’s go at </p><p>once,” she cried with a show of impatience, </p><p>and she stood and began gathering up the </p><p>robes. </p><p> My imagination was incapable of detect-</p><p>ing anything masculine in her splendid </p><p>womanhood. I could not suppress a small </p><p>smile at her suggestion. Instantly she </p><p>was the woman of the X. Y. post and was </p><p>commanding: </p><p> “Call the Indian! Tell him we start at</p><p>once.” </p><p> Flat Mouth appeared on the scene before</p><p>I could remonstrate with her. In Chip- </p><p>pewa she repeated to him her intention of </p><p>starting for the Red River. He shook his </p><p>head, saying— </p><p> “We must stay here a little longer.”</p><p> “You two can stay. I will go alone.</p><p>The country is perfectly safe. The Sioux </p><p>have lost the trail entirely.” </p><p> I have no doubt she would have taken a</p><p>pony and set forth if I had not stopped her, </p><p>saying: </p><p> “You can’t go alone. We’ll take orders</p><p>from the Pillager.” </p><p> “I’ll take orders from no one,” she</p><p>haughtily informed. “I suppose I may </p><p>have one of the horses, seeing that they </p><p>belonged to the Sioux?” </p><p> “No.”</p><p> “Very well, I can make it afoot,” she</p><p>calmly said. </p><p> “What’s the matter with you?” I angrily</p><p>inquired. “Can’t you reason? Or is it </p><p>your temper?” ‘ </p><p>I thought she was trying to annihilate </p><p>me with her furious gaze. By an effort </p><p>she mastered herself and quietly retorted: </p><p>“My temper is nothing to you. We’re </p><p>thrown together by a series of mishaps. I </p><p>appreciate your coming to find me, but if </p><p>your coming makes you feel any responsi- </p><p>bility for my acts I’m sorry you came.” </p><p>“The Lord forbid I should ever have to </p><p>be responsible for such a bundle of spite </p><p>as you seem to be,” I peevishly protested. </p><p>She smiled with her lips, turned and </p><p>walked towards the plain. I caught up </p><p>with her and demanded— </p><p> “What do you plan?”</p><p> “I’m on my way to the X. Y. post,” she</p><p>lazily informed. </p><p> “Unless you return to cover at once the</p><p>Pillager and I will tie you.” </p><p> ‘.‘You would never dare!” she gritted,</p><p>turning on me like a cat. </p><p> All my silly resentment dropped from me,</p><p>and I gently explained: </p><p> “Miss Dearness I should never dare to</p><p>look a man, red or white, in the face if </p><p>I allowed you to start alone for the Red. </p><p>I won’t threaten again to tie you, but if you </p><p>start for the Red I’ll go with you. It’s </p><p>hardly fair to let the Pillager go with us </p><p>as he is of a different race.” </p><p> She fought the battle with herself, her</p><p>red hair being a true gage of her temper. </p><p>Suddenly she surrendered, murmuring: </p><p> “I was wrong. We’ll go back to the</p><p>chief.” </p><p>• “You’re tired. Your nerves are out of </p><p>tune. In a few hours it will be night; then </p><p>we can go.” </p><p> “It isn’t my nerves,” she contritely</p><p>corrected. “It’s just temper.” </p><p> “My temper is off the key. Of course</p><p>I spoke foolishly when I said I would tie,- </p><p>you.” </p><p> “I’ll obey orders.”	_ ^</p><p> Flat Mouth had watched us without</p><p>a lineament of his strong face betraying </p><p>that he could either see or hear. When </p><p>we joined him he gave her a quick look and </p><p>walked towards the horses. She remained </p><p>silent, not inclined to talk. I waited some </p><p>minutes to see if she desired companionship, </p><p>then went after the Pillager. </p><p> The chief was crouching behind some</p><p>cherry trees and had, I observed, shifted </p><p>the horses deeper into the growth. He was </p><p>staring intently out on the plain. He </p><p>motioned for me to drop beside him. My </p><p>heart gave a thump, for I had been so </p><p>positive we had shaken the Sioux off our trail </p><p>that this hint of their presence weakened </p><p>me for a moment. </p><p> “Assiniboins,” he said.</p><p> “Where?” I demanded. He pointed to</p><p>the northern rim- and by much staring </p><p>through half-closed lids I managed to make </p><p>out some dots. </p><p> “Buffaloes,” I decided.</p><p> “Assiniboins,” he repeated.</p><p> “Then they’re friendly. They won’t</p><p>102 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>do anything worse than try to steal our </p><p>horses.” </p><p> “They've killed traders when catching</p><p>them alone. These are not of the same </p><p>band that comes to the Pembina.” </p><p> “All the Assiniboins are good robe-</p><p>makers. They’re all friendly with the </p><p>whites,” I persisted. </p><p> “These are not any Red River band. If</p><p>they see us they will do their best to kill </p><p>us and take our horses. I am an Indian. </p><p>I tell you I know this.” </p><p> As a trader I had had experience only</p><p>with straggling bands of the tribe. It was </p><p>hard for me to believe that I had anything </p><p>to fear from a people who begged rum </p><p>rations from me and who went and came </p><p>when I gave the word. My incredulity must </p><p>have been obvious, for the chief hissed out— </p><p>“Do you think Eshkebugecoshe is afraid?” </p><p>No, he was not afraid. He had lived </p><p>with Mandans and had fought with them </p><p>and their allies, the Crows, against these </p><p>same Assiniboins and the Sioux. The </p><p>tribe had taken to horses, being a migratory </p><p>people and forever chasing the buffalo, </p><p>and horses they must have. That they </p><p>would appropriate ours if they got the </p><p>chance went without saying, but I had sup- </p><p>posed the theft would be committed with </p><p>stealth and in no event be accompanied </p><p>with violence. </p><p> “Say what is to be done and we will do it,”</p><p>I agreed. </p><p> “We will wait until they go. If they</p><p>come down here we will follow up the </p><p>river,” he replied. Then very significantly— </p><p>“They must not see the white woman.” </p><p>“She was big medicine to them once,” </p><p>I reminded. </p><p> “To those who came to the Pembina.</p><p>But the Voice is back on the River That </p><p>Calls, and this band would kill her to </p><p>prevent it being stolen again.” </p><p> I remembered what the girl had told me,</p><p>much to the same effect, and if Flat Mouth </p><p>was not afraid, I was.</p><p> Yet I still hoped and half believed the</p><p>dark objects were buffaloes. At so great </p><p>a distance it is impossible to detect any </p><p>but the most rapid motion. A horse </p><p>galloping at full speed will scarcely appear </p><p>to be moving. So far as the dots were </p><p>concerned, they appeared to be stationary. </p><p>We rose to go back to the camp, and I was </p><p>debating whether it was necessary to in- </p><p>form Miss Dearness of this possible new </p><p>peril, when the Pillager gave a sharp yelp </p><p>and went bounding through the bush as if </p><p>the devil were nipping his heels. Believing </p><p>the girl was in some danger, I charged after </p><p>him. When I entered the glade he was </p><p>furiously stamping out a little fire. Miss </p><p>Dearness stood at one side anxiously </p><p>watching him. </p><p> “What have I done now?” she whispered</p><p>to me. </p><p> “Nothing,” I warmly assured, scowling</p><p>at the Pillager. </p><p> “Green bark!” he grunted and, tilting</p><p>his head, he pointed upward. Even with </p><p>the fire extinguished there was a pale haze </p><p>floating clear of the tree tops. </p><p> I belittled it, saying—</p><p> “An eagle couldn’t see that, Eshke-</p><p>bugecoshe.” </p><p> “They have sacrificed dogs to their</p><p>manito, Their medicine is strong,” he </p><p>gloomily retorted. </p><p> “What’s the matter, Mr. Franklin? Are</p><p>the Sioux near?” cried Miss Dearness. </p><p> “Not a Sioux in sight. The Pillager and</p><p>I disagree about some dots out on the plain. </p><p>He says they’re Assiniboins. I say they </p><p>are buffaloes.” </p><p> “And he fears they saw the smoke,”</p><p>she cried, wringing her hands. “Now I’ve </p><p>brought new danger on you two by my </p><p>thoughtlessness. It was so dreary waiting. </p><p>I forgot myself. I threw some green bark </p><p>on the hot ashes to see it curl up—it burst </p><p>into flame—then I fed on some green sticks </p><p>—I bring bad luck.” </p><p> “Nonsense,” I sharply replied. “Is it</p><p>surprizing that a band of thieving Indians </p><p>should stumble upon us here? They will </p><p>stand dear of my gun. It’s stood off their </p><p>betters.” </p><p> I turned to Flat Mouth and boasted the</p><p>same to him. </p><p> He shook his head energetically:</p><p> “It’s no medicine to the Assiniboins, the</p><p>Crees or the Chippewas. They have seen </p><p>it and its two barrels, and the truth has </p><p>gone through the three tribes. They are </p><p>two shots afraid; that is all. Soon the </p><p>Sioux of the plains will know about it. </p><p>Then it won’t be medicine to them.” </p><p>HE RAN back to watch the dots, </p><p>and Miss Dearness and I followed </p><p>him. Now they were no longer </p><p>dots but mounted men. They had drawn </p><p>near enough for us to be sure of this, and </p><p>Gentlemen of the North </p><p>103 </p><p>yet they strangely resembled' buffaloes. . It </p><p>was not until a line of them raced parallel </p><p>to our hiding place that I discovered the </p><p>cause for my fancy. Each warrior wore </p><p>on his head a covering of buffalo hide to </p><p>which were fixed two horns. In some cases </p><p>tliis strange head-gear comprised the whole </p><p>head of the creature, the skull bones having </p><p>been carefully removed, and the skin worn </p><p>as a hood. </p><p> They seemed to be racing about aim-</p><p>lessly, and I rejoiced to the Pillager— </p><p> “They didn’t see the smoke.”</p><p> “It was such a tiny smoke they couldn’t,”</p><p>added Miss Dearness. </p><p> The Pillager’s answer was a silent drama.</p><p>Without a word he reached over his shoulder </p><p>and pulled arrows from his quiver. With- </p><p>out removing his gaze from the swiftly </p><p>maneuvering horsemen he placed the ar- </p><p>rows before him in a row, then caught up </p><p>his bow and drew the cord taut. Miss </p><p>Dearness glanced at me with a little frown </p><p>worrying her forehead. </p><p> “They think we’re here?” I asked Flat</p><p>Mouth. </p><p> “They know it,” he tersely responded.</p><p> To my way of thinking the horsemen</p><p>were not acting suspiciously. One of them, </p><p>the leader, whirled a disk of rawhide from </p><p>the point of his lance and the riders raced </p><p>to where it fell, jabbing and spearing until </p><p>one managed to pick it up. He, in turn, </p><p>carried it triumphantly aloft until hard </p><p>pressed, when he sent it sailing from him, </p><p>and again the mad scramble to obtain it. </p><p> I doubted the Pillager’s bald assertion</p><p>until I noted that the rawhide was always </p><p>being sent in our direction. Each rush </p><p>brought the band closer. Now the chief </p><p>had the piece of hide and his men were </p><p>strung out behind him in undulating loops </p><p>like the letter S greatly prolonged. My </p><p>eyes were distracted by the constantly </p><p>shifting loops. Yet the leader, with each </p><p>maneuver, brought them nearer to the </p><p>woods.</p><p> “They’re coming!” I softly warned as the</p><p>first loop suddenly swung far forward so as </p><p>to line up fully thirty warriors riding </p><p>abreast with their chief on their left. </p><p> “Fire the gun and get back to the</p><p>horses!” ordered Flat Mouth, snatching up </p><p>an arrow. </p><p> With a terrific shout the whole band</p><p>came toward us. I fired both barrels into </p><p>the front rank, and a miss was impossible. </p><p>Flat Mouth’s bow began to twang, and his </p><p>arrows streamed into the center of the </p><p>assault. </p><p> “Get to the horses!” he cried and then</p><p>raised a war-cry. </p><p> It was not the Pillager’s yell, but the cry</p><p>of the Sioux, and faster and faster flew </p><p>the arrows. I seized the girl’s wrist and </p><p>urged her to the camp. I had barely </p><p>slipped the hobbles and gathered up the </p><p>halter ropes when Flat Mouth came </p><p>gliding to us, his face exalted with the lust </p><p>of battle against great odds. Without a </p><p>word he took his horse and began leading </p><p>the way along a deer-path that led up- </p><p>stream. The girl rode behind him, and I, </p><p>on foot, brought up the rear. </p><p> I managed to reload one barrel and, as</p><p>nothing happened, I halted and charged </p><p>the other. The way was rough and at </p><p>every rod we read the signs of much game. </p><p>Little piles of hair at the foot of trees whose </p><p>bark was worn smooth showed 'that the </p><p>buffaloes penetrated the thickets in con- </p><p>siderable numbers. Signs of bears were </p><p>the most plentiful, however. It was a </p><p>pelt-hunter’s paradise if he could gather the </p><p>toll without losing his scalp. </p><p> After an hour of continuous travel the</p><p>Pillager halted and briefly explained: </p><p> “They didn’t dare to enter the woods</p><p>at first, thinking the Sioux were there. </p><p>My Sioux war-cry and the Sioux arrows </p><p>fooled them. They’ll soon find out their </p><p>mistake. Their men are creeping in now; </p><p>soon they’ll see where only two men and a </p><p>woman camped. Soon they will come </p><p>fast.” </p><p> “What shall we do now?” asked Miss</p><p>Dearness. </p><p> “Cross the river and strike for the</p><p>Mandan villages on the Missouri,” was the </p><p>astounding answer. </p><p> I gasped aloud in dismay. Leave the</p><p>post with only foolish Probos on duty, </p><p>with old Tabashaw having free rein to in- </p><p>timidate, to bully, and to consume the </p><p>company’s rum! Run to the Missouri to </p><p>escape while home was so near? </p><p> “It must be so,” growled the chief,</p><p>guessing my reluctance. “Only in that </p><p>way can we save the white woman.” </p><p> “To the Mandan villages it is, then,”</p><p>I agreed. </p><p> “I’m willing to risk turning back,” spoke</p><p>up Miss Dearness. </p><p> “Eshkebugecoshe is not willing,” grimly</p><p>104 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>retorted the chief. “I killed some of them, </p><p>and the gun killed some. When they see </p><p>how they were tricked only one torture will </p><p>satisfy them. Wait while I look at the </p><p>river.” </p><p> He glided down the rough and heavily</p><p>timbered bank. While he was gone I </p><p>strained my eyes, seeing an enemy in every </p><p>bush and stump. At last he returned and, </p><p>without speaking, led his pony down the </p><p>slope. I estimated our position to be </p><p>directly south of the Lac du Diable country </p><p>and I knew, from talks with the post </p><p>Indians, that the river woods we were now </p><p>traversing thinned out into scattering </p><p>willows a few miles farther west. </p><p> The river was once occupied by the</p><p>Cheyennes who served as a barrier between </p><p>the Sioux and the Chippewas, being neutral </p><p>to both. More than half a century before, </p><p>the Chippewas, a very jealous people by </p><p>nature, got the idea the neutrals were </p><p>favoring the Sioux in trade. While return- </p><p>ing from an unsuccessful expedition, a war- </p><p>party of Chippewas fell on a Cheyenne </p><p>village and killed many. The Cheyennes </p><p>promptly migrated across the Missouri, and </p><p>since then the red shadow of the Sioux has </p><p>hung over the Chippewas, with no neutral </p><p>nation between to minimize the shock of an </p><p>attack. </p><p> The crossing was not difficult and we</p><p>made it easily and surmounted the opposite </p><p>bank, but lefL a trail a bull buffalo could </p><p>read. Flat Mouth held up his hand for </p><p>silence and cocked his ear. 1 heard nothing </p><p>beyond the usual noise of wood life. </p><p> “They’re following our trail,” he warned.</p><p>“If we stick to the woods they will overtake </p><p>us. Our only chance is to take to the </p><p>open now and ride for it. Our horses are </p><p>fresh, theirs are tired. Once on the plain, </p><p>we can leave them.” </p><p> “But they’ll chase us?” asked the girl.</p><p> He nodded and, to cheer her up, added:</p><p> “We shall find some Mandans, or some</p><p>of the Big Bellies (Minnetarees) hunting </p><p>buffalo. They will help us.”</p><p> We broke through the timber and started</p><p>for the southwest at a gallop. We had </p><p>gone not more than a fourth of a mile when </p><p>a ringing cry sounded behind us. Glancing </p><p>back, I beheld a warrior dancing and waving </p><p>his arms at the edge of the timber. We </p><p>had not advanced more than half a mile </p><p>before nearly a hundred horsemen emerged </p><p>from the woods. </p><p> Flat Mouth was worried, for well he knew</p><p>that it would take more than an ordinary </p><p>hunting party to stand off such a force. </p><p>At the start the chances favored us, as our </p><p>animals were well rested, whereas the </p><p>enemy’s had been ridden far and fast. </p><p>There was no question as to our maintain- </p><p>ing a safe lead,providing none of our animals </p><p>met with an accident. Realizing this my </p><p>eyes became focused on the flying feet </p><p>of Miss Dearness’ mount. At every stride </p><p>I expected to see a hoof stick into a hole </p><p>and hurl her to the ground, leaving one of </p><p>our mounts to carry double. I glanced </p><p>back once more and beheld even more </p><p>warriors quitting the woods. </p><p> Flat Mouth grimly explained:</p><p> “Big war-party going to fight the</p><p>Mandans. We shall have them all the </p><p>way.” </p><p> He insisted it was the medicine of the</p><p>girl’s hair that permitted us to drop them </p><p>before night came. I felt a great uplift </p><p>when, with the last light, I failed to make </p><p>out their figures against the northern </p><p>sky-line. The chief quietly assured me </p><p>they would be on our trail in the morning. </p><p> We camped that night in the bed of a dry</p><p>coulee. The chief managed to kill a buffalo </p><p>calf with his bow and arrow, and we ven- </p><p>tured to build a small fire, fencing it about </p><p>with our white robes. Over this we </p><p>broiled some excellent steaks and cooked </p><p>enough to carry with us on the morrow. </p><p>At daybreak we were up, and beheld figures </p><p>creeping over the horizon. </p><p> The country grew rougher with each</p><p>hour, and we lost the Assiniboins only </p><p>when we dropped into the hollows. On </p><p>surmounting ridge or hillock we raised them </p><p>to view again, tenaciously sticking to our </p><p>track. Flat Mouth had eyes only for</p><p>what was ahead, seeking for some oppor- </p><p>tunity of shaking the enemy off. I was </p><p>always staring behind me, fascinated by the </p><p>implacable purpose that held the savages </p><p>to the chase. The girl rode with head </p><p>bowed, seldom bothering to lift her gaze </p><p>from the ground. Her fear was an accident </p><p>to her pony. </p><p> We began to encounter coulees filled with</p><p>water, each a sign-post for the Couteau du </p><p>Missouri, the rough and hilly country we </p><p>must cross before descending to the Mis- </p><p>souri River. The Pillager believed the </p><p>Assiniboins would not venture beyond this </p><p>height of land. Yet they were in such </p><p>Gentlemen of the North </p><p>105 </p><p>strong force they might recklessly risk an </p><p>encounter with Mandan or Minnetaree. </p><p>AHEAD were the steep red banks </p><p>of the Missouri. At our feet were </p><p>two cows freshly slain. Flat Mouth </p><p>inspected them, and for the first time since </p><p>our flight from the Cheyenne his immobile </p><p>features showed animation. </p><p> “The brains have been taken to dress</p><p>hides. Hunters did it, not a war-party </p><p>after meat. Only Mandans hunt here.” </p><p> The Assiniboins had been lost to sight</p><p>for a day. In their place we were dreading </p><p>a Sioux war-party, for the Sioux hung </p><p>closely about the Mandan villages, seeking </p><p>to pick off a victim or two. To the north </p><p>of the villages was a stretch of timber, </p><p>and in this cover small bands of the Sioux </p><p>would hide and wait for days, being satisfied </p><p>if they killed a lone hunter or a woman. </p><p>We had passed through the rough country </p><p>of the Couteau and had an excellent view </p><p>of the river in the southeast. Flat Mouth </p><p>insisted we were too far down-stream and </p><p>said we must cross a high and precipitous </p><p>bank on our right. To me it seemed a </p><p>needless exertion, as we could round the </p><p>end of the ridge by skirting its base until </p><p>it broke off at the river, but the chief felt </p><p>the menace of the Sioux and must have </p><p>his way. I did not believe the horses </p><p>could make the ridge, for the soil was </p><p>glutinous mud from the spring rains. </p><p> The Pillager dismounted to demonstrate</p><p>what an Indian pony could do and with </p><p>the beast scrambling like a cat he led the </p><p>way up the slope. Miss Dearness made </p><p>light of it, although she was forced to </p><p>climb it afoot. On reaching the top we </p><p>had a more intimate view of the river. </p><p>The valley was some two miles in width </p><p>and caged in by steep banks. The current </p><p>was sluggish and swollen, dotted with much </p><p>driftwood and many black dots which </p><p>I knew to be drowned buffalo. Imme- </p><p>diately below us was a growth of big cotton- </p><p>woods, and from our position to these </p><p>woods ran a well-beaten path. </p><p> For the first time since our race began,</p><p>I presumed to take the lead, but before</p><p>I could do more than press ahead to the </p><p>brow of the ridge, Flat Mouth was halting </p><p>me and explaining that the way was full </p><p>of dangers and that he must go first. I </p><p>placed my gun across my saddle, but the </p><p>danger was not animate and consisted </p><p>of certain deep holes, or pits the Indians </p><p>had dug for trapping fox and wolves. </p><p>These pits were ten or more feet deep, with </p><p>the openings masked by the dead grass. </p><p> We descended slowly and cautiously,</p><p>skirting several of these menaces, and </p><p>I know I should have plunged into the </p><p>first one, had I had my way. At the foot of </p><p>the ridge the Pillager reined in and warned: </p><p> “We must say we have come from Fort</p><p>Assiniboin, that the Medicine Hair is the </p><p>daughter of the big white chief there and </p><p>that we work for him. The big white chief </p><p>wishes to open a post here and sends his </p><p>daughter because her medicine lets her see </p><p>things we men can not see. He has told </p><p>us to stay but a few days and to ask for </p><p>warriors to go back with us as far as the </p><p>Mouse. The Mandans must not know </p><p>we were driven here by the Assiniboins. </p><p>They would think the white woman’s </p><p>medicine was weak and that her father </p><p>was a little chief if they knew the Assini- </p><p>boins had made us run.” </p><p> “Why can’t we start back as soon as we</p><p>get fresh horses?” I anxiously asked, my </p><p>mind reverting to the incompetent Probos </p><p>in charge of the post and to old Tabashaw </p><p>bullying him for rum. </p><p> “And why must we travel by the way</p><p>of the Mouse?” demanded Miss Dearness, </p><p>referring to the long route to the confluence </p><p>of the Mouse and the Qu’Appelle, thence </p><p>down the Assiniboin to the Forks, where </p><p>we would turn south up the Red. </p><p> “We must stay and look about, as if look-</p><p>ing for a good place for a post,” Flat Mouth </p><p>patiently explained. Then to the girl— </p><p>“We must come from Fort Assiniboin to </p><p>show why we are here. We must go back </p><p>the same way to make our talk sound </p><p>straight. Even if we could pick our trail </p><p>we must return by way of the Mouse and </p><p>the Assiniboin. It is the regular path and </p><p>safer.” </p><p> I told Miss Dearness the chief was right</p><p>and that a few days wouldn’t make much </p><p>difference, that we ought to be thankful </p><p>at having escaped the Sioux and the </p><p>Assiniboins—this to cheer her up. </p><p> “Oh, we will go through with it,” she</p><p>wearily replied. “I was thinking of you </p><p>and your affairs more than of mine. I </p><p>have no trade to lose. Angus can watch </p><p>the post till I get back or my successor </p><p>arrives.” </p><p> With our story understood we started</p><p>io6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>ahead, taking the semblance of a road </p><p>which had been much traveled but never </p><p>repaired. It was filled with mud and holes </p><p>and eloquently revealed the ravages of the </p><p>Spring freshet. We followed this into the </p><p>woods and continued through the growth </p><p>for two miles. It was most abominable </p><p>traveling. At last we were clear of it and </p><p>were come to a riot of beans, squash and </p><p>corn sprouts, but so mixed with grass that </p><p>I proclaimed it to be mighty poor garden- </p><p>ing. I was disappointed, as I had heard </p><p>much about the Mandans as agricultur- </p><p>ists. Flat Mouth explained, however, that </p><p>these budding growths were runaways </p><p>and represented only what the wind had </p><p>stolen and sown broadcast. The tribe’s </p><p>gardens were farther on. </p><p> “Here is the village!” warned the girl.</p><p>She checked her mount and stared </p><p>wonderingly and, with a little shudder, </p><p>exclaimed: </p><p> “It’s like a village of the dead. Where</p><p>are the Indians?” </p><p> Flat Mouth twisted uneasily in his saddle</p><p>and whispered: </p><p> “It is a village of the dead—a village they</p><p>left when I was here last. The gardens </p><p>would not grow. After so many years the </p><p>ground refuses to care for the seed; then </p><p>they move. When they left this place </p><p>they used it for their dead.” </p><p> We pressed ahead a bit and came in full</p><p>view of the gruesome exhibit. The girl </p><p>quailed for a moment, then held up her </p><p>head and gazed about steadily. Every- </p><p>where were platforms some ten feet in </p><p>height, and on these were laid the dead. </p><p>The shrouds were of dressed leather, some </p><p>in very excellent condition and fit for trade; </p><p>but for the most part the coverings had </p><p>succumbed to the weather and had fallen </p><p>apart, allowing the bones to show. Some of </p><p>the platforms had fallen to the ground and </p><p>no attempt had been made to replace them </p><p>or their grim burdens. We quickened our </p><p>pace and soon were beyond the forbidding </p><p>spot. </p><p> “Remember our talk!” warned the Pil-</p><p>lager, kicking his horse into a gallop and </p><p>riding ahead. </p><p>OFF at one side and at a distance </p><p>was an Indian with a gun. Around </p><p>him were women and children </p><p>working. These were the gardeners and </p><p>they were planting and hoeing under an </p><p>armed guard. This was' impressive proof </p><p>of their daily danger. Even at the very </p><p>outskirts of their villages they did not </p><p>dare to move about without a sentinel. </p><p>Just as the Red River of the North always </p><p>contained the menace of the Sioux, so did </p><p>the stretch of woods hold for Mandan and </p><p>Minnetaree a hidden danger. </p><p> At the Pillager’s gesture the girl and I</p><p>halted while he rode to the man with the </p><p>gun. I saw the fellow nervously cock </p><p>his piece, then stand keenly at attention </p><p>while Flat Mouth, with both hands above </p><p>his head, talked to him. Suddenly the </p><p>gun was lowered, and the guard was </p><p>shaking hands warmly with our companion. </p><p> “He recognizes him,” murmured the</p><p>girl. </p><p> The two conversed for several minutes,</p><p>then came to us. Flat Mouth announced </p><p>it was all right, that we were to proceed </p><p>and find quarters at the village a short </p><p>distance ahead. The guard smiled broadly </p><p>and shook hands with me, but seemed to </p><p>stand in awe of Miss Dearness. Later I </p><p>learned the Pillager had filled him with </p><p>tales concerning the wonderful medicine </p><p>she possessed and her powers as a magician. </p><p>Then the guard looked at my pony and at </p><p>the chief’s and said something we could </p><p>not understand. </p><p> “He asks where our presents are,”</p><p>translated the Pillager. </p><p> He might well be puzzled, for beyond</p><p>the white robes snugly wrapped in my </p><p>blanket we had no possessions. No volun- </p><p>tary visitor to the villages would fail to </p><p>bring a pack-animal or two loaded with </p><p>gifts. </p><p> Before I could scare up an answer the</p><p>girl was haughtily saying in Chippewa: </p><p> “Tell him the big white chief does not</p><p>send gifts by his friends. He has slaves </p><p>to bring them. They will come later. He </p><p>will decide how much to send after he hears </p><p>how we have been treated.” </p><p> Flat Mouth’s eyes twinkled as he listened,</p><p>but his bearing was stern and haughty as </p><p>he translated her words to the guard. </p><p> The guard next informed us that an</p><p>H. B. man was living in the village across </p><p>the river, but was now on the headwaters </p><p>of the Missouri looking for trade in Spring </p><p>beaver. </p><p> The man returned to his charge, and we</p><p>rode on. All I could think of on first </p><p>glimpsing the round domes of the Mandan </p><p>Gentlemen of the North </p><p>107 </p><p>houses was of a colony of gigantic beavers. </p><p>These huts were very large, some being </p><p>ninety feet in diameter and so solidly </p><p>built that fifty men could lounge on their </p><p>tops at a time. The door of each was of </p><p>rawhide, stretched over willow, and was </p><p>nearly six feet square. A broad porch </p><p>led up to this. Near each porch was a </p><p>platform, a score of feet long, half as wide </p><p>and eight or nine feet high. On these </p><p>platforms they stored their corn to dry in </p><p>the Fall, also their meat, but now these </p><p>were being used for driftwood. </p><p> Flat Mouth told us the village depended</p><p>entirely for their supply of fuel on what </p><p>the river brought down each Spring. </p><p>From my view of the swollen stream and </p><p>its innumerable trees I could see the toll </p><p>must be enormous. The reason why we </p><p>had not seen more Indians in traveling to </p><p>the village was because the able-bodied </p><p>were bus}- swimming in the icy current </p><p>and bringing the drift ashore, while their </p><p>people watched and encouraged them. </p><p>Besides the driftwood they brought drowned </p><p>buffalo ashore in large numbers, and these </p><p>were already giving off the stench of decay. </p><p>My Chippewas would salvage the dead </p><p>brutes when the ice went out, when the </p><p>meat was firm and fresh, but the Mandans </p><p>and the Minnetarees, the Pillager assured </p><p>me, preferred the tainted to the fresh. </p><p> What men I saw on shore were stout and</p><p>strongly built and wore their hair trailing </p><p>at their heels and even sweeping the ground. </p><p>As they daubed this daily with red and </p><p>white earth the effect was grotesque. The </p><p>same cough which was troubling our In- </p><p>dians seemed to be common with them. </p><p> As we entered the village we were dis-</p><p>covered and quickly surrounded. They </p><p>greeted us cordially, shaking hands and </p><p>seemingly much pleased at our coming. </p><p>Some recognized Flat Mouth and hailed </p><p>him as a friend. Then they commenced </p><p>asking where we had left our packs. As </p><p>he had explained to the armed guard, so now </p><p>did the Pillager explain to the tribe that </p><p>while we represented the greatest traders </p><p>of the North we had brought no goods with </p><p>us either for trade or for gifts. Their faces </p><p>fell.</p><p> The chief continued to explain how our</p><p>errand was to investigate the chances of </p><p>trade. Of course he described Miss Dear- </p><p>ness as being a medicine-woman and the </p><p>daughter of the big white chief at the head </p><p>of the fort on the Assiniboin. It was </p><p>grimly amusing that I should pose as an </p><p>engage instead of bourgeois, that she, of </p><p>the opposition, should masquerade as my </p><p>superior. </p><p> The interest Miss Dearness aroused was</p><p>accumulative, and it was plain she created </p><p>a tremendous impression. One young buck </p><p>standing close to her pony reached up a </p><p>hand to feel the texture of her fiery hair. </p><p>As quick as loup-cervier her hand rose, </p><p>and the handle of her leather whip landed </p><p>on his wrist, causing him to spring back </p><p>in dismay. I think it was the blazing fire </p><p>of her blue eyes, rather than any physical </p><p>hurt from the blow, that startled the fellow. </p><p> Flat Mouth look occasion to warn that</p><p>the hair was medicine and that the white </p><p>woman had saved the young man’s life </p><p>by preventing his touching it. After that </p><p>incident the circle widened. In turn the </p><p>Indians informed us that the Sioux had </p><p>been very troublesome ever since the snow </p><p>melted, and that since Le Borgne (The </p><p>Blind), the great war chief of the Minne- </p><p>tarees on the Knife a few miles above, had </p><p>gone out with a hunting party, the Mandans </p><p>had kept their huts barricaded every night. </p><p>On his return an alliance was to be formed </p><p>with the Cheyennes and aggressive mea- </p><p>sures taken to teach the enemy a lasting </p><p>lesson. </p><p> Flat Mouth to further increase our</p><p>prestige and make them forget we came </p><p>without gifts, now stated that the good-will </p><p>of the white woman was worth a war-party </p><p>and that her anger was equal to a blast of </p><p>lightning. </p><p> Firmly believing as he did that the girl</p><p>possessed powers of magic, he did not hesi- </p><p>tate to draw a long bow, and I was fearing </p><p>that she might be requested to bolster up </p><p>her reputation by some little display, when </p><p>a newcomer distracted the attention. This </p><p>was none less than Poscopsahe, or Black </p><p>Cat, the chief of the village. We were </p><p>presented to him and he was duly im-</p><p>pressed by the girl and assured her that </p><p>the big white chief would do well to send </p><p>traders there and to the Minnetaree vil- </p><p>lages above, but especially to his village </p><p>of the Mandans. This jealousy, when it </p><p>came to acquiring the white man’s goods </p><p>in trade, was very keen among the villages, </p><p>although they would unite readily and </p><p>solidly enough in opposing their ancient </p><p>enemies. </p><p>io8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Through the Pillager, the girl calmly</p><p>replied that she had heard the Mandans </p><p>had a good trade in robes and buffalo </p><p>tongues and a fair trade in beaver; that </p><p>she would look the villages over for a day </p><p>or so and then report back to Fort Assini- </p><p>boin. </p><p> With these ceremonies out of the way we</p><p>were shown to a hut reserved for visitors. </p><p>I took my pack of white robes inside </p><p>and turned the horses over to a young man. </p><p>One of the chief’s wives followed us to the </p><p>hut with a huge dish of boiled corn and </p><p>beans, a tasteless mess, and another of </p><p>dried meat. The latter was impossible </p><p>jecause of the Mandans’ preference for </p><p>tainted to fresh meat, so on the whole we </p><p>■nade a sorry meal of it. </p><p>- Despite our explanation that we had no </p><p>goods to trade, nor gifts to bestow, the men, </p><p>women and children crowded about our </p><p>hut, eager for us to open our packs. The </p><p>fact that they had seen all our possessions, </p><p>namely my bundle of robes, did not spoil </p><p>their imagination. White people always </p><p>had gifts, always wanted to trade. They </p><p>believed that in some mysterious manner </p><p>we would produce articles of the white </p><p>man’s making which they were so eager to </p><p>secure. •&gt; It was with the greatest difficulty </p><p>that Flat Mouth persuaded them to believe </p><p>we had nothing to trade, and their attitude </p><p>was sullen when they finally withdrew. </p><p> After' they left us in peace the Pillager</p><p>advised that we take up different quarters, </p><p>urging that by doing so we would create a </p><p>better impression. So we decided that </p><p>Miss Dearness should remain in the guest </p><p>hut with the chief’s wife as attendant, </p><p>while the Pillager and I found shelter else- </p><p>where. Leaving her with the Indian </p><p>woman, we went out to look the village </p><p>over. The Mandans, being a settled people, </p><p>had no need for dogs, so this nuisance was </p><p>not in evidence. The children, too, were </p><p>quite decently mannered, although they </p><p>would have stolen the clothes off my back </p><p>had I given them a chance. The population </p><p>of this and the village across the river was </p><p>about two thousand, Flat Mouth said. I </p><p>suggested we cross over and visit the second</p><p>village. Flat Mouth called out to some </p><p>young men, and, on my giving them a few </p><p>inches of tobacco, they readily agreed to </p><p>set us across. </p><p> Proceeding to the river, I had my first</p><p>sight of a bull-boat, as their curious skin </p><p>canoes are called. They were much differ- </p><p>ent from the skin canoes we used on the </p><p>Red River, being circular in shape and </p><p>formed of raw buffalo hides stretched over </p><p>a frame of willow. The craft had the </p><p>appearance of being very frail and not a </p><p>bit suitable for navigating the swollen and </p><p>muddy waters of the Missouri, yet each </p><p>was capable of carrying eight hundred </p><p>pounds or more. </p><p> One man did the paddling, and his paddle</p><p>was a five-foot pole with a strip of board </p><p>lashed across the end. With his first stroke </p><p>the boat turned nearly around, but he </p><p>quickly reversed us with a stroke on the </p><p>other side. First one was looking up-stream </p><p>at the mass of floating trees and dead </p><p>buffalo, then down-stream. It made me </p><p>dizzy, yet our man was an expert, for we </p><p>drifted less than a quarter of a mile, whereas </p><p>the average boatman would have drifted a </p><p>full mile. </p><p>THE news of our arrival in the first </p><p>Mandan village had spread across </p><p>the river, and on landing we were </p><p>met by a crowd of natives, headed by Big </p><p>Man, a Cheyenne prisoner and now adopted </p><p>into the tribe—a man of prominence. He </p><p>shook us warmly by the hand and anxiously </p><p>asked why we had left all our packs in </p><p>Black Cat’s village. The tedious explana- </p><p>tion was given by Flat Mouth and the </p><p>interest of the assemblage flattened out, </p><p>and many turned away to resume the work </p><p>of towing trees and dead buffalo ashore. </p><p> Through the Pillager I learned from Big</p><p>Man that the Minnetaree village was much </p><p>excited over the arrival of six Cheyennes </p><p>seeking a peace treaty. Messengers had </p><p>been sent for Le Borgne to bring him back </p><p>from the hunt. Black days were waiting </p><p>for the Sioux, once the treaty was per- </p><p>fected. We paraded the village, finding it </p><p>a duplicate of the one across the river. We </p><p>v*ere invited into several huts to eat, but </p><p>always found the meat abominable. On </p><p>the outskirts of the village women with</p><p>hoes made from buffalo shoulder-blades </p><p>were working in their gardens, with armed </p><p>men stationed at intervals. Their danger </p><p>was intimate, much like that which sur- </p><p>rounds some of the smaller wood-folk who </p><p>live under stumps, sporting and raising </p><p>their little families while death stalks them </p><p>day and night. </p><p> The Pillager mumbled to me— i</p><p>Gentlemen of the North </p><p>109 </p><p> “We must go back now.”</p><p> I had known him long enough to realize</p><p>that he was disturbed at something. </p><p>Thanking Big Man and telling him he </p><p>should have presents when our traders </p><p>arrived, we returned to the river and were </p><p>ferried across. </p><p> “Something makes my brother sad,”</p><p>I remarked in Chippewa after we had </p><p>stepped ashore. </p><p> “I was glad when I heard that the Blind</p><p>was away on a buffalo hunt. My heart is </p><p>heavy now, for they send to bring him home </p><p>to meet the Cheyennes.” </p><p> “You believed we should find him here</p><p>before we arrived,” I reminded. </p><p> “I knew and hoped for the best. When</p><p>we came and found him gone my heart </p><p>sang. I believed we should get away </p><p>before he returned. Now to find he will </p><p>come back, makes me sorry.” </p><p> “The Blind does not like white men?”</p><p>“He likes white men,” was the laconic </p><p>response. </p><p> “Then why feel sad to know he is coming</p><p>back?” </p><p> “He likes women. He has never seen</p><p>such a woman as Medicine Hair. He is </p><p>a mighty war chief. His word is law in </p><p>both Minnetaree and Mandan villages. </p><p>When we fought the Sioux and the Assini- </p><p>boins I thought only of escaping to a place </p><p>where we would not be killed. I knew we </p><p>would not be harmed in these villages. </p><p>Now I have had time to think. What the </p><p>Blind wants he takes.” </p><p> The danger must be pressing when an</p><p>Indian would be troubled over the fate </p><p>of a white woman. His words reduced </p><p>my complacency to ashes. I could only </p><p>say— </p><p> “We must start before he comes back.”</p><p>“They will think our coming is a trick </p><p>if we go away too quickly,” he warned. </p><p>“I will talk with the Mandans and ask if</p><p>they have seen any signs of Assiniboins </p><p>or Sioux to the north. We must visit the </p><p>villages, but in one or two sleeps we might </p><p>start for the Mouse. Once we reach Fort </p><p>Assiniboin the Medicine Hair will be safe.” </p><p>“But Le Borgne would be very blind to </p><p>make the whites angry by taking one of </p><p>their women,” I protested. </p><p> Flat Mouth smiled in grim pity at my</p><p>ignorance. </p><p> “You do not know the Blind,” he mur-</p><p>mured. “He takes what he wants. No </p><p>chief is as powerful as he. When I was </p><p>here before, he took a woman from a </p><p>Mandan chief who went with his war-club </p><p>to bring her back. They buried his war- </p><p>club with him. He likes white men. He </p><p>will treat you better than his warriors, </p><p>but he doesn’t let anything stand between </p><p>him and the thing he wants.” </p><p>FROM the end of the village rose </p><p>the girl’s wonderful voice, singing </p><p>her quaint song, in which one heard </p><p>the rush of the river and the sighing of the </p><p>wind, a voice of sadness and pathos, yet </p><p>colored with a rare beauty. For the first </p><p>time I realized there were no Indians hang- </p><p>ing about us begging for tobacco and gifts. </p><p>We walked to the guest-hut and found the </p><p>entire village grouped about it. Black Cat </p><p>was seated on a robe, before the entrance, </p><p>smoking his Missouri tobacco—villainous </p><p>stuff—and wondering at the medicine of her </p><p>voice. </p><p> “When she sings her medicine song I see</p><p>the leaves turn yellow and drop, and I feel </p><p>the first of the snow. I hear the ice break- </p><p>ing up and smell the first grass,” said Black </p><p>Cat as we stood beside him. </p><p> “She calls the voices from rivers and</p><p>sends them back when she is tired of them,” </p><p>Flat Mouth boasted. “She is very strong </p><p>medicine. It is her hair. The Chippewas </p><p>are afraid of her.” </p><p> “The Chippewas are old women,” snorted</p><p>Black Cat. </p><p> Flat Mouth’s visage grew very wicked.</p><p>From inside the robe he was wearing </p><p>Mandan-fashion he pulled forth a grisly </p><p>string of Sioux scalps, shook them in Black</p><p>Cat’s face and hoarsely taunted: </p><p> “I am a Chippewa. I do not hide in</p><p>a village when the Sioux of the Plains </p><p>come near. I go out and kill them. Have </p><p>the Mandans any old women who take </p><p>scalps like these?” </p><p> It was a master-stroke for putting the</p><p>beggars in their proper place. The Cat </p><p>was unable to speak for a full minute. His </p><p>eyes glowed and gloated over the trophies. </p><p>He sprang to his feet and loudly proclaimed: </p><p>“My Chippewa brother is a very brave </p><p>man. I will adopt him as a son. He shall </p><p>have a new war name. He shall have </p><p>many wives. He shall carry the pipe for us </p><p>against our enemies.” </p><p> I feared Flat Mouth would indulge in</p><p>more boasting and scornfully flout the </p><p>no </p><p>Adventure </p><p>chief’s offer, but his finesse was sharpened </p><p>because of the girl’s peril. He replied— </p><p>“After I have taken Medicine Hair back </p><p>ta her father.” </p><p> This gave the Cat great pleasure. He</p><p>pictured himself basking in the glory of </p><p>his new son/ the recipient of homage, the </p><p>possessor of many scalps. He loudly an- </p><p>nounced he would give a feast for the </p><p>mighty Chippewa and forthwith directed </p><p>his wives to prepare an abundance of stink- </p><p>ing meat, corn and beans. The Indians </p><p>scattered in all directions to make ready </p><p>for the festival. Black Cat hurried off to </p><p>see his commands were obeyed, and, with a </p><p>glance at me, the Pillager walked beside </p><p>him. </p><p> I remained before the hut. The door</p><p>swung open a crack, then wide open, and </p><p>Miss Dearness confronted me, her eyes </p><p>searching mine anxiously. </p><p> “When can we start from this place?”</p><p>she whispered. </p><p> “Very soon—in a few days.”</p><p> “A few days!” she faintly exclaimed.</p><p>“Something tells me we must start at once.” </p><p>“The Pillager would say it is your medi- </p><p>cine,” I bantered. </p><p> “It is instinct. It has never failed me</p><p>since I came to the Indian country. Let </p><p>us start tonight!” </p><p> “But that would invite danger. We</p><p>must make a pretense of looking the villages </p><p>over for trade purposes,” I protested. “If </p><p>there is any vital, any immediate danger, </p><p>of course we will start at once and fight for </p><p>it. Now tell me just what has happened.” </p><p>“Nothing has happened,” she slowly re- </p><p>plied, her eyes staring into mine and yet </p><p>not beholding me. “But I’m afraid—I am </p><p>horribly afraid—different from anything </p><p>I ever felt in my life—I’m never afraid of </p><p>death.” With this she closed the door, </p><p>leaving me standing there gaping like a </p><p>zany. </p><p>CHAPTER IX </p><p>AT THE M1NNETAREE VILLAGE </p><p>EARLY next morning Flat Mouth and I </p><p>went to Miss Dearness’ hut and, on </p><p>her joining us at the porch, asked her to </p><p>make ready for a trip to the Minnetaree </p><p>villages a few miles above, situated on the </p><p>Knife River. To attempt leaving the </p><p>country without visiting these “Big Bel- </p><p>lies,” as the trade had named them, would </p><p>be to incur the wrath of Le Borgne and </p><p>throw discredit on our story of represent- </p><p>ing the N. W. Company and its plan to </p><p>set up an opposition to the already estab- </p><p>lished H. B. trader. </p><p> The girl was afraid. Her bearing was</p><p>calm and collected enough, but there were </p><p>transient flashes in her big blue eyes, a </p><p>curious trick of glancing sidewise through </p><p>half closed lids, that bespoke a furtive fear. </p><p>However, she readily agreed we must visit </p><p>the upper villages to sustain our role. She </p><p>only insisted that we make all haste to have </p><p>it over with. </p><p> As I was anxious to go and return before</p><p>Le Borgne came back, I directed Flat </p><p>Mouth to engage men to cross our horses, </p><p>promising them some handsome pipes when </p><p>the traders arrived with their assortment of </p><p>goods. The Mandans proved to be as </p><p>expert in handling the horses in the river </p><p>as they had been in collecting the driftwood. </p><p>Hitching a fine to a nag’s mouth, a brave </p><p>would take the end between his teeth and </p><p>swim ahead while others swam alongside </p><p>and behind the animal. In this way the </p><p>three were taken across quickly and drifted </p><p>down-stream scarcely at all. </p><p> When we landed from the bull-boat and</p><p>mounted our horses, we were surrounded </p><p>by the entire village, every one being </p><p>anxious to gaze on the white woman with </p><p>the medicine hair. Miss Dearness would </p><p>have drawn her capote over her head but </p><p>the Pillager urged her not to, declaring that </p><p>the belief she was a magician would help </p><p>us much. So she rode between us with </p><p>her oriflamme of a head glinting in the early </p><p>sunlight and making me think of a maple </p><p>turned red by the first frosts. </p><p> Flat Mouth improvised a legend which</p><p>he sung as we slowly made our way through </p><p>the crowd. It was to the effect that beams</p><p>of sunlight became imprisoned in the girl’s </p><p>hair when she was born, and that their </p><p>struggles to escape created the powerful </p><p>medicine she possessed. </p><p> Big Man walked by my side and in-</p><p>formed me a hunting party of a hundred </p><p>braves was due to arrive home after a three </p><p>days’ trip and that, if we would postpone </p><p>our visit to the Minnetarees, we could </p><p>procure some fresh meat. I immediately </p><p>feared lest the Minnetaree chief, Le Borgne, </p><p>would be with this party, but Flat Mouth </p><p>explained that the Minnetarees hunted </p><p>to the southwest of the Knife and the </p><p>Gentlemen of the North </p><p>hi </p><p>Mandans to the southeast, the river being </p><p>the boundary. We needed fresh meat </p><p>badly, but the hunting party would greatly </p><p>delay our journey up the river, so we </p><p>pressed on more determinedly than ever. </p><p> I assured Miss Dearness that we could</p><p>make the villages, ride through them and </p><p>start back for Black Cat’s village before </p><p>dark. On returning and recrossing the </p><p>river we could decide whether to start north </p><p>immediately, unaccompanied, or wait till </p><p>morning and endeavor to obtain an escort </p><p>from the Mandans. The girl was for an </p><p>immediate departure. </p><p> I had planned to take my white robes</p><p>with me, thinking I might have a chance </p><p>to trade them for horses, they being about </p><p>the only thing the Minnetarees would ex- </p><p>change horses for. Flat Mouth, however, </p><p>insisted such a trade would consume all the </p><p>day, that the horses we had were fresh </p><p>enough, and that the hides had better be </p><p>left behind in the hut, where they would be </p><p>perfectly safe. </p><p> So we rode forth. Miss Dearness’ peculiar</p><p>type of loveliness was greatly accented by </p><p>the appearance of the Mandan women, </p><p>who could not be called comely even by </p><p>Indian standards. I never could under- </p><p>stand why the Crows, the most lascivious </p><p>of all the Indians I ever met, should be the </p><p>most prepossessing in appearance, or why </p><p>the women of the Aricaras, the most </p><p>treacherous of any tribe I ever encountered, </p><p>should approach the nearest to the white </p><p>standard of good looks. </p><p> Miss Dearness was not inclined to talk,</p><p>and we rode rapidly, as if eager to have done </p><p>with a disagreeable errand. The road we </p><p>followed was very decent and led us over </p><p>two hills and then for two miles across a </p><p>plain, skirting a small village which we did </p><p>not enter. The whole distance was through </p><p>an area of gardens which included much </p><p>ground given over to the cultivation of sun- </p><p>flowers. In every direction were horses </p><p>grazing on the early grass, and Flat Mouth’s </p><p>eyes glittered as became a true Pillager. </p><p>All these animals were brought into the </p><p>villages at night, revealing the Indians’ </p><p>constant dread of their inveterate enemies,</p><p>the Sioux and the Assiniboins. The Ran- </p><p>dans kept their ponies in their huts while </p><p>the Minnetarees used small corrals. </p><p> These villages on the Missouri and Knife</p><p>were distinct from any I ever became ac- </p><p>quainted with. They suggested per- </p><p>manency and a strong devotion to the </p><p>soil, especially the villages of the Mandans. </p><p>Our road along the south bank of the </p><p>Missouri to the Knife afforded almost </p><p>continuous glimpses of a bucolic life which </p><p>made me think of Canadian villages. </p><p> All hunting was done in large bands,</p><p>Flat Mouth told me, for fear of surprize </p><p>attacks. Each hunting party, therefore, </p><p>contained the potentials of a war-party. </p><p>Even when in large numbers the warriors </p><p>did not care to wander far from their homes </p><p>lest the villages be assaulted in force during </p><p>their absence. Because of this caution it </p><p>became necessary to conserve the buffalo </p><p>and under no circumstances scare him away. </p><p>It resulted that they aimed to surround a </p><p>small herd of a few hundred and kill every </p><p>one. They believed that if a survivor </p><p>escaped he would communicate his alarm </p><p>to other herds. Nor did they use their </p><p>guns in hunting, but always the bow and </p><p>arrow. </p><p> The first pause in our journey was at the</p><p>Minnetaree village at the mouth of the </p><p>Knife, consisting of half a hundred huts </p><p>and called the ‘‘little village.” We very </p><p>quickly learned there was a great difference </p><p>between this and either of the Mandan </p><p>villages in regard to manners. </p><p> The moment we were sighted a mob of</p><p>young demons surrounded us, hooting and </p><p>deriding. Their elders sat smoking their </p><p>miserable tobacco on top of the huge </p><p>circular huts and enjoying the spectacle. </p><p>More troublesome even than the children </p><p>were the dogs which swarmed from all </p><p>directions. They were as vicious as wolves </p><p>and much more daring. </p><p> Miss Dearness, who had drawn her</p><p>capote over her head when we neared the </p><p>village, gave a cry of alarm, and I spurred </p><p>forward and brained a brute with the butt </p><p>of my gun as he leaped high to pull her from </p><p>the saddle. This act caused much scowling </p><p>and mumbling from the spectators, which</p><p>I interpreted to be threats. Flat Mouth </p><p>leaned low from his saddle and did for </p><p>another beast with his ax. The mumbling </p><p>broke into a sullen roar, and the men on the </p><p>huts began rising and preparing to descend. </p><p> Flat Mouth pulled out his string of Sioux</p><p>scalps and, waving them above his head, </p><p>shouted his name and the fact that he had </p><p>once lived among the Mandans and the </p><p>Minnetarees. Then in their own tongue </p><p>he chanted his record of coups, touching </p><p>112 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>a scalp as he narrated the details of each </p><p>encounter. The men on the huts gathered </p><p>to the edge and allowed their feet to hang </p><p>down while they listened. </p><p> Finishing the story of his exploits, the</p><p>Pillager explained how he was serving the </p><p>woman with the medicine hair, the most </p><p>wonderful woman ever on the Missouri, </p><p>whose father was the mightiest of all </p><p>traders and who had intended to build a </p><p>post among the villages so the Indians </p><p>could always obtain whatever they wanted </p><p>in arms and ammunition. He significantly </p><p>concluded with saying: </p><p> “The big white chief will send no traders</p><p>where his daughter is met by mad dogs </p><p>and screaming children.” </p><p> Then, turning to Miss Dearness, he di-</p><p>rected her to reveal her hair. </p><p> She obeyed, and'as the Indians stared at</p><p>her fiery hair, those on the ground drew </p><p>back and forgot their scowls, while those </p><p>on the huts stood erect and forgot their </p><p>smoking. As the Pillager rapidly trans- </p><p>lated his speech to me I understood their </p><p>concern; each village was anxious to obtain </p><p>all the white man’s goods possible and was </p><p>extremely jealous of every visit made by </p><p>a trader to a neighboring village. </p><p> Their lack of hospitality was an excellent</p><p>excuse for us to save time by pushing on. </p><p>Although they beseeched us to enter their </p><p>huts and partake of food and tobacco, we </p><p>held on steadily through the village and </p><p>into the road leading up the Knife. They </p><p>followed us outside the village but we gave </p><p>them no heed. We followed the road for </p><p>about a mile when the Pillager halted and </p><p>announced that we were opposite the big </p><p>Minnetaree village. He said it consisted </p><p>of some hundred and thirty huts, but, rub </p><p>my eyes as I would, I could not see it. </p><p> Then he explained this. The last of the</p><p>five villages was located a mile back from </p><p>the river, and because of this fact and the </p><p>resulting problem over fuel the warriors </p><p>moved into the hills each Winter, where </p><p>they had more circular huts and wood </p><p>aplenty. We forded the Knife with the</p><p>water up to our horses’ bellies and made a </p><p>dash for the village. </p><p>THIS time we met less of the rude- </p><p>ness which had greeted us below, </p><p>and yet there was no suggestion </p><p>of hospitality. They were rude in another </p><p>way. We were ignored. They were most </p><p>arrogant in their bearing. After ordering </p><p>a woman to show us to a big hut, set apart </p><p>for visitors, they paid no attention to us. </p><p>A physical characteristic of all Minnetarees </p><p>was the large aquiline nose. The Pillager </p><p>assured us we were safe among them, but </p><p>added that this was the case purely because </p><p>they must have arms from traders to protect </p><p>themselves from the Sioux, and they believed </p><p>that we were paving the way for permanent </p><p>traders. The village originally contained </p><p>a thousand huts, but the deadly small-pox </p><p>had whittled it down to its present pro- </p><p>portions. </p><p> The hut we were shown to was a duplicate</p><p>of the one in Black Cat’s village except </p><p>that it was dug down three feet below the </p><p>surface. As tn the Mandan huts we found </p><p>earthen pots and a copper kettle. The </p><p>kettle, it seems, was used entirely for </p><p>boiling meat. Why they couldn’t cook </p><p>meat in the earthenware, as. they did </p><p>their com and beans, I do not know. Some </p><p>foolish superstition was behind it, of </p><p>course. I asked the woman about it, and </p><p>she said the meat would make the earthen </p><p>pots crack. </p><p> I quickly learned it was unsafe to move</p><p>outside the hut unless armed with a club. </p><p>The first Lime I stepped to the door to </p><p>survey the scene, I was set upon by a huge </p><p>dog. I kicked myself clear of the brute </p><p>and after that I never ventured abroad </p><p>without a club in my hand. So long as we </p><p>remained in the hut we were left by our- </p><p>selves. The moment we passed through </p><p>the door we were surrounded by impish </p><p>brats who would go through our clothes </p><p>and filch anything they could. Miss Dear- </p><p>ness went out with us once, but the repulsive </p><p>sights and the constant attendance of the </p><p>vicious-mannered mob which accompanied </p><p>us every step was experience enough for </p><p>her. </p><p> “You and the Pillager carry out your</p><p>plans,” she urged after we returned to the</p><p>hut. “But let us start back to the Mandan </p><p>village before dark.” </p><p> “It’s a beastly place,” I admitted, pitying</p><p>her deeply. “I almost wish, for your sake, </p><p>we had tried to win back north without </p><p>coming here. I think we could have </p><p>made it.” </p><p> “No, we stood no chance. The Sioux</p><p>were too close, the Assiniboins too many. </p><p>Our lives are safe here, but we ought to be </p><p>starting for the Red River within a day </p><p>Gentlemen of the North </p><p>113 </p><p>or two.” After a pause she asked, “When </p><p>do you think Le Borgne will come?” </p><p> “Not till after we have gone. You have</p><p>heard of him?” </p><p> “My father spoke of him when we were</p><p>on the Assiniboin. The Indians had much </p><p>to tell of him. But go and finish your busi- </p><p>ness so we can be getting away.” </p><p> The undercurrent of her thoughts was</p><p>Le Borgne, that sinister master of the </p><p>Minnetarees, who ruled as an autocrat, </p><p>an unusual condition of affairs among the </p><p>Indians. I did not care to ask her what she </p><p>had heard about the chief; it was sure to be </p><p>something disquieting. I picked up my </p><p>club and, followed by Flat Mouth, passed </p><p>from the hut. </p><p> We had a brisk battle with the dogs but</p><p>finally put them to rout. Young bucks </p><p>swaggered close, glaring murderously at </p><p>our success over their pets. One was so </p><p>bold as to step before the Pillager to block </p><p>his path, or to make him step aside. Flat </p><p>Mouth slapped him in the face with his </p><p>string of Sioux scalps, called him a “child,” </p><p>and asked how long before he could grow up </p><p>and kill a Sioux. </p><p> The buck, maddened beyond self-control</p><p>and knowing the warriors were watching </p><p>his shame, grabbed for his ax. Flat Mouth </p><p>smiled evilly and dangled the string before </p><p>his face. The hand on the ax relaxed. I </p><p>was using the medicine bag taken from </p><p>the war-chief killed in the Red Lake River </p><p>country, as a tobacco pouch. Now I pro- </p><p>duced it, filled my pipe and through the </p><p>Pillager advised the young man and his </p><p>friend not to bother mighty warriors who </p><p>never bothered to slay any but chiefs </p><p>carrying the pipe. </p><p> The display of scalps and the sight of</p><p>the medicine pouch brought the elders to </p><p>sharp attention. Several approached, their </p><p>bearing very decorous, and questioned the </p><p>Pillager. He proudly proclaimed himself </p><p>a hero and gave his new name of Sioux </p><p>Killer. He declared I came next to him </p><p>and said the white woman with the medi- </p><p>cine hair was more powerful than both</p><p>of us. </p><p> The lowering glances continued, yet your</p><p>exhibit of trophies had made a deep im- </p><p>pression and forced their respect. Their </p><p>great chief, Le Borgne, would have been </p><p>proud to recite the coups the Pillager had </p><p>recounted. Harsh commands were given, </p><p>and the band of children drew back, the </p><p>young men ceased their insolence, and </p><p>women clubbed the dogs to the outskirts </p><p>of the village. </p><p> Then Le Borgne’s brother, Caltahcota,</p><p>or Choke-cherry, as the traders knew him, </p><p>deigned to make himself known and in- </p><p>quired minutely into the purpose of our </p><p>visit. He was pleased with the story I told </p><p>through the Pillager, and said his brother </p><p>would be very glad to welcome us, but that </p><p>we had done wrong in not bringing guns, </p><p>powder and ball with us, as the Sioux were </p><p>very thick and troublesome around the </p><p>village. </p><p> The Pillager sneered and loudly declared</p><p>he would drive the Sioux away and double </p><p>the length of his string. Choke-cherry </p><p>seemed to accept him at his own estimation, </p><p>and his respect took on a touch of awe. He </p><p>insisted we go into his hut and eat. </p><p> We followed him and were presented with</p><p>bowls of meat that only one word can </p><p>describe—putrid. Even for politeness’ sake </p><p>I could not endure the stench of it, let alone </p><p>tasting it. Choke-cherry gobbled at it </p><p>voraciously and gave us some dried beans </p><p>and corn, bruised in a mortar, cooked with- </p><p>out salt, and very tasteless. Still it could </p><p>be swallowed. Flat Mouth was not par- </p><p>ticular as to what he ate, yet there were </p><p>limits to even his Indian appetite and </p><p>stomach. He partook only of the corn and </p><p>beans. While we were bolting our portions </p><p>he assured me that the Minnetarees would </p><p>kill a buffalo in Winter, leave it in the snow </p><p>and wait until decomposition had set in </p><p>before using it for food. I could well </p><p>believe it. </p><p>ESCAPING to the free air, I asked </p><p>Choke-cherry when his mighty </p><p>brother would lje back. He be- </p><p>lieved in a few days. He was very vague, </p><p>indicating he knew no more about it than </p><p>we did. The six Cheyenne envoys had</p><p>withdrawn a mile north of the village to </p><p>await the coming of more of their people. </p><p>Upon their arrival the treaty between them </p><p>and the Minnetarees would be duly ce- </p><p>mented. The Minnetarees would adopt </p><p>a Cheyenne youth and many presents </p><p>would be “placed under the stem.” While </p><p>Le Borgne was too big a man to abandon </p><p>a hunting trip for any purpose except to </p><p>follow his own will, it was probable he would </p><p>return very soon. </p><p> With the Pillager interpreting I said:</p><p>H4 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “We must go back lo the lower villages to-</p><p>night. When your brother comes send a </p><p>man to us so we may come to him.” </p><p> He urged that we remain with the</p><p>Minnetarees indefinitely, but I explained </p><p>we had certain trade preparations to make, </p><p>and he finally agreed to inform us when the </p><p>chief ^irrived. </p><p> Utterly disgusted with the villages,</p><p>determined to get away where I could feel </p><p>clean once more, and sensing that it must </p><p>be hell for Miss Dearness, I made up my </p><p>mind on the spot to make a break north </p><p>from the Mandan village early the next </p><p>morning. Fear of the Sioux would keep </p><p>the village Indians from pursuing us, </p><p>while the presence of the Cheyennes on </p><p>the Knife, anxious to make peace, would </p><p>tend to make both Sioux and Assiniboins </p><p>chary about remaining in that neighbor- </p><p>hood. </p><p> The Mandans, while peacefully disposed</p><p>and much less arrogant than the Minne- </p><p>tarees, were known as dogged fighters. </p><p>Allied with the Cheyennes, they could carry </p><p>a good fight to the Sioux, and the latter </p><p>knew it. By striking directly north and </p><p>traveling much by night I believed we could </p><p>make the big loop of the Mouse. After </p><p>following the Mouse a short distance we </p><p>would be within the sphere of influence of </p><p>the N. W. Company, represented by Fort </p><p>Assiniboin, and our dangers from hostile </p><p>red men would be over. Nor did I expect </p><p>any difficulty in leaving the Mandan </p><p>village. We had come and gone as we </p><p>pleased, our story was believed, and we had </p><p>visited the Minnetaree village to consult </p><p>with Le Borgne’s brother. </p><p> Leaving Choke-cherry — Cherry-on-a-</p><p>Bush was his full name, I believe—we re- </p><p>turned to the hut and found Miss Dearness </p><p>seated on a robe before the empty firehole </p><p>and looking very' sad. I briefly explained </p><p>my purpose, and it was worth great risks </p><p>to behold the wonderful lighting up of the </p><p>blue eyes as she turned them on me. </p><p> “It will succeed!" she cried in English.</p><p>“It must! Oh, you’ve removed a big load </p><p>from my heart. To be out in the open—to</p><p>breathe clean air again—anything but this!” </p><p> “You’ve seen so much of Indian life in</p><p>traveling with your father that you must </p><p>be prepared to withstand what would shock </p><p>an inexperienced white woman,” I re- </p><p>marked. </p><p> “True,” she murmured. “I can force</p><p>myself to indifference to much that’s re- </p><p>pulsive—a make-believe indifference, any- </p><p>way. I’ve said the Indians talked of Le </p><p>Borgne on the Assiniboin. I’ve also heard </p><p>the H. B. men describe him in talking with </p><p>my father. He likes to meet white men. </p><p>He treats them better than his warriors do. </p><p>He’s shrewd enough to know he must have </p><p>arms, and he can get them only through </p><p>the white traders. From the Indian stand- </p><p>point he is a very great man. Yes, he’s </p><p>that even by our standards. He controls </p><p>these villages absolutely, and you know how </p><p>dearly an Indian prizes his personal liberty. </p><p>Le Borgne overrides many hard-and-fast </p><p>rules of ordinary Indian usage. What he </p><p>wants he takes.” </p><p> Her face went red as she finished; then</p><p>the color receded, leaving her cheeks a </p><p>ghastly white, and her hand fumbled at </p><p>something inside her leather coat, probably </p><p>her knife. </p><p> “You understand him as well as the</p><p>Pillager does,” I gravely commented. “Per- </p><p>haps it’s best you should.” </p><p> “The truth is always best,” she simply</p><p>replied. “The fact is there. It would be </p><p>foolish to hide from it as a calf hides his </p><p>head in the grass to escape a hunter.” </p><p> Flat Mouth, who had listened and picked</p><p>up a word here and there, now broke in: </p><p>“When I was here last, Le Borgne would </p><p>go into a hut and take a warrior’s wife away </p><p>from him. The warrior never made any </p><p>fight. Le Borgne is a great chief.” </p><p> His lack of finesse in making the brutal</p><p>speech would have angered me more if I did </p><p>not believe the girl knew all that he knew. </p><p>She glanced with a curious little smile and </p><p>quietly said— </p><p> “Well, he will never take me.”</p><p> “What nonsense! Of course not!” I</p><p>cried hotly. “To hear us one would think </p><p>this raw savage was all powerful. Then </p><p>again, let’s give him credit for having some </p><p>sense. He wants traders to come here so </p><p>he can stand off the Sioux. Is he fool </p><p>enough to spoil all the chances for saving </p><p>his people from the Sioux by turning every </p><p>trader against him? Of course not. Miss </p><p>Dearness, you haven’t any cause to worry.” </p><p>She reached out and patted my hand and </p><p>murmured— </p><p>“Comforter!” Then she reminded—“Yet </p><p>there is some danger, so great that you plan </p><p>to return to the Mouse without an escort.” </p><p>She had me. In all honesty I insisted </p><p>Gentlemen of the North </p><p>115 </p><p>our proposed flight was impelled by idle </p><p>fears, so far as we knew. Beyond the </p><p>general character of Le Borgne we had </p><p>no reason for deducing he would bring down </p><p>the wrath of the American Government </p><p>upon him by stealing a white woman. </p><p> “Tell that to these Indians and they</p><p>will laugh at you,” she jeered. “You can’t </p><p>make them believe but what they are the </p><p>most superior and the most brave people </p><p>on earth. There may come a time when </p><p>your Government can control them. Now </p><p>they have no more respect for or fear of </p><p>your Government than that of China, which </p><p>they never heard of. Why, they even be- </p><p>lieve they outnumber the whites. Tell </p><p>them of big white villages beyond the </p><p>Mississippi, and they will tell you that you </p><p>lie. I’ve traveled enough with my father </p><p>and have heard enough trade-talk to at </p><p>least know that much.” </p><p> I had to admit the truth of her state-</p><p>ments and shifted to the contention that </p><p>the chief’s imperative need of guns would </p><p>come first in his heart. He might laugh </p><p>at the United States Government as a </p><p>shadowy thing, but he would never laugh </p><p>at the Sioux and a powerful trading com- </p><p>pany. Believing we all three represented </p><p>the N. W. company, he would be anxious </p><p>for us to carry back pleasant reports and </p><p>thereby hasten the establishment of a per- </p><p>manent post. </p><p> “And yet you plan to escape at the</p><p>earliest opportunity—tomorrow morning if </p><p>we can manage it,” she monotonously re- </p><p>minded. </p><p> “We can wait and see the chief and have</p><p>him send an escort with us,” I boldly </p><p>declared. </p><p> With a little shudder she protested:</p><p> “No! No! We must start tomorrow.</p><p>Instinct tells me we must do so. I only </p><p>wish we could start now. I tell you I am </p><p>afraid, and I’m not bothered with any silly </p><p>imagination. I feel as if something were </p><p>about to happen.” </p><p> “For heaven’s sake don’t let our friend</p><p>here know that, or he’ll sit down and sing </p><p>his death song, waiting for some one to </p><p>club him to death. You’re big medicine </p><p>to him. So long as he can believe that, </p><p>he can do much.” </p><p> “Medicine Hair big medicine,” mur-</p><p>mured Flat Mouth, catching at the familiar </p><p>words, although puzzled bv the rest of our </p><p>talk. </p><p> She raised her head and stared at us</p><p>both haughtily. The effect at once regis- </p><p>tered on the Pillager. Smoothing out her </p><p>wonderful hair, she softly sounded the </p><p>ululating call that carried the whispering </p><p>of the wind and the prattling of shallow </p><p>rivers. The chief stood very straight, his </p><p>head tipped back, his nostrils distended. </p><p> There was a warrior’s ambition in his</p><p>small eyes. If he had been disturbed by </p><p>her downcast mien he was now restored </p><p>to all his old-time strutting complacency. </p><p>He was the chief of the Pillager Chippewas. </p><p>The Minnetarces were low dogs who lived </p><p>cooped up in a village and ate stinking </p><p>meat. The hand that struck against his </p><p>robe where hung his scalps was itching for </p><p>more bloody work. Then the door of the </p><p>hut swung open, and Choke-cherry stood </p><p>before us, blinking at the girl. </p><p>HE WAS wearing a gorgeous head- </p><p>gear made from a turkey-cock’s </p><p>tail, and he seemed much puffed </p><p>up with his own importance. For a few </p><p>moments he forgot his errand and stared </p><p>at Miss Dearness and her lustrous hair. </p><p>With an effort he recalled his business and, </p><p>in a loud voice, began reciting. As he </p><p>talked he pounded his chest and glanced </p><p>from me to the girl and then to the im- </p><p>passive Pillager. When he had finished, </p><p>the Pillager explained that the messenger </p><p>sent to inform Le Borgne of the Cheyennes’ </p><p>presence at the village had found the great </p><p>chief a short distance up the Knife. But, </p><p>being a great chief, it did not please his </p><p>fancy to quit the hunt, even for making </p><p>the peace treaty. Accordingly he had sent </p><p>the messenger back with directions for his </p><p>brother, the renowned and redoubtable </p><p>Choke-cherry, to treat with the Cheyennes </p><p>and to adopt the Cheyenne youth. </p><p> These delegated powers had swollen</p><p>Choke-cherry’s conceit almost to the ex-</p><p>ploding point. Out of*, five brothers to </p><p>Le Borgne he had been picked. He had </p><p>sent word to the Cheyenne camp that he </p><p>was coming to act for his illustrious brother </p><p>and, to give more tone to the cere- </p><p>mony, he desired his new friends to be </p><p>present. </p><p> Miss Dearness’ face remained cold</p><p>and proud, but her soul was on her lips </p><p>when she whispered to me: </p><p> “Thank God he isn’t coming. You two</p><p>go, and I will wait here.” </p><p>116 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> On being informed of our decision, Choke-</p><p>cherry violently objected. He needed the </p><p>medicine of her hair, he said. Never had </p><p>the Cheyennes seen such hair. Her at- </p><p>tendance was absolutely necessary, he </p><p>insisted. </p><p> “You’d better come,” I urged after Flat</p><p>Mouth had interpreted. “It will give </p><p>us better standing with them. We can </p><p>ride directly from the ceremony to the </p><p>lower village.” </p><p> “If you think best,” she surrendered,</p><p>rising and gathering up her capote. </p><p> Choke-cherry had had small chance to</p><p>wear the purple, I took it, and his dignity </p><p>and conceit were terrific. As Choke-cherry, </p><p>the warriors would have laughed at him; </p><p>as the mouth-piece of his illustrious brother, </p><p>his orders were obeyed with great celerity. </p><p>Our horses were brought to the hut, and </p><p>the buck who acted as hostler did not even </p><p>pause to beg for the usual piece of trade </p><p>tobacco. We found the village humming </p><p>with unusual activity, and Choke-cherry, </p><p>every few rods, halted his pony and hoarsely </p><p>harangued the people. These speeches </p><p>had no point, I deduced from Flat Mouth’s </p><p>grim smile of contempt, but they killed the </p><p>time which I believed to be precious. </p><p> Finally we were ready and rode beside</p><p>Choke-cherry at the head of two hundred </p><p>or more mounted warriors. They had </p><p>decorated their ponies with white and red </p><p>earth, some showing white or red hand- </p><p>prints to advertise that their riders had </p><p>grappled bare-handed with an enemy. </p><p>Others were marked with stripes. </p><p> The riders, too, were painted, but they</p><p>would have been very ferocious to be- </p><p>hold even without any coloring, for the </p><p>majority of them showed wide welts in the </p><p>flesh, produced by pushing an arrow-head </p><p>along under the skin. Many had several </p><p>of these hideous ridges running from the </p><p>hand to the shoulder and then down on </p><p>the chest, where^lhey ended in a series of </p><p>circles. Nearly all had scalps hanging </p><p>from their bridles or from the handles of </p><p>their axes and spears. The women, also </p><p>mounted, brought up the rear. These</p><p>were uniformly tattooed with broad lines </p><p>from the nose to the cars, and from the </p><p>comers of the mouth down to the throat. </p><p> As we galloped along behind Choke-</p><p>cherry, Flat Mouth festooned his scalps </p><p>down the front of his robe, while I hung </p><p>the Sioux medicine pouch on my breast. </p><p>Several groups of young men now swung </p><p>in ahead of us, riding ten abreast and </p><p>chanting their war-songs and sounding </p><p>their rattles. Choke-cherry produced the </p><p>ceremonial pipe from a case carried across </p><p>his saddle, and held it high in one hand so </p><p>that it could not touch his horse. </p><p> Now, while we went in superior numbers</p><p>to sign a peace pact, yet we moved in a </p><p>compact body as if fearing an attack. </p><p>Nor was this because of any ceremony. </p><p>We were afraid of an attack. Word was </p><p>given for the young men to cease racing </p><p>their ponies and stay close with the main </p><p>body, and more than one of the gun- </p><p>bearers saw that his piece was properly </p><p>primed and slipped an extra ball into his </p><p>mouth. </p><p> When, within about a quarter of a mile</p><p>of the Cheyenne camp, a score of warriors </p><p>came racing out to meet us, on horse-flesh </p><p>that was far superior to anything the </p><p>Minnetarees owned, their animals’ heads </p><p>were cunningly concealed in masks repre- </p><p>senting buffalo and red deer heads. The </p><p>riders were all young men and they rode </p><p>up to us, shook hands and cried out greet- </p><p>ings in their own language. </p><p> On beholding Miss Dearness they seemed</p><p>strangely affected and lost much of their </p><p>noisy manner. Flat Mouth and his decora- </p><p>tions also impressed them, although he </p><p>wore none of the finery the Minnetarees </p><p>were displaying. But he had the proof of </p><p>having been at hand-grips with the Sioux. </p><p> As they galloped back to their camp they</p><p>repeatedly turned to gaze at us. Choke- </p><p>cherry took all this to his own credit, but </p><p>I knew it was the girl and her vivid hair </p><p>that attracted these backward glances. </p><p>She, too, was moved by the stirring spec- </p><p>tacle, and her blue eyes flashed and sparkled </p><p>and roamed back and forth to take in all </p><p>the details of the lively panorama. For </p><p>the moment she was forgetting the filth</p><p>and the annoyance and was beholding only </p><p>the barbaric grace of the riders, and the </p><p>pictorial rioting of colors. </p><p> Choke-cherry, the old wind-bag, now</p><p>halted the long line and rode from front </p><p>to rear, pausing every rod to spout and roar </p><p>his orders, determined to live his brief </p><p>authority to the limit. He lectured them </p><p>on the virtue of keeping their finery un- </p><p>soiled, so as to do honor to their tribe. He </p><p>exhorted them to carry themselves care- </p><p>fully, so as to give no offense and spoil the </p><p>Gentlemen of the North </p><p>117 </p><p>peace. He severely scolded a band of </p><p>Mandans, who rode at one side and out of </p><p>line. Flat Mouth said the Mandans had to </p><p>stand much overbearing conduct from </p><p>their allies, but added that, aside from the </p><p>Borgne, no Minnetaree ventured beyond </p><p>certain limits. </p><p> Because of Choke-cherry’s love for</p><p>speech-making I feared we would never </p><p>make the camp and have the ceremony </p><p>of adoption done with, but fortunately a </p><p>great war-chief of the Cheyennes now </p><p>dashed out to meet us on a white stallion </p><p>and put an end to our leader’s mouthing. </p><p>This man was a magnificent specimen. He </p><p>wore a blue coat, procured in trade with </p><p>the Spaniards through some of the southern </p><p>tribes, and a gaily striped blanket. He </p><p>all but rode us down and had his horse’s </p><p>hoofs pawing the air over my head in a most </p><p>disconcerting manner. </p><p> He shook hands with me ’and Miss</p><p>Dearness, at whom he stared overlong, </p><p>and with the Pillager. Choke-cherry, who </p><p>was a few hundred feet behind us, now </p><p>galloped up and fussily took over the </p><p>management of the situation. The chief </p><p>shook hands with him cordially, but his gaze </p><p>alternated between the girl’s hair and the </p><p>stern cold face of the Pillager with his wealth </p><p>of Sioux hair. The business of handshaking </p><p>done with, he fell back, and a large number </p><p>of his men rode forward and mingled with </p><p>the Minnetarees and Mandans, shaking </p><p>hands and shouting a welcome. </p><p>AT A signal from their chief the </p><p>Cheyennes fell into long lines with a </p><p>military precision and galloped to </p><p>their camp. We followed at a sedate pace. </p><p>When we arrived, the chief and several </p><p>of the older men rode back and forth </p><p>through the camp, reminding their people </p><p>that the Minnetarees were their friends, </p><p>that they were to be fed and protected </p><p>from thieves. There were a hundred </p><p>leather tents in the camp, white as snow </p><p>and set in a horseshoe with the opening </p><p>toward the north. The speech of the </p><p>Cheyennes is much more pleasing to the </p><p>ear than that of the Mandans or Minne- </p><p>tarees and reminded me much of our </p><p>northern Crees.</p><p> Thus far all had gone smoothly. Then,</p><p>like a bolt, a band of Cheyennes darted </p><p>from their camp and rode like mad along </p><p>our back trail. At first I supposed this </p><p>to be one of their graceiul maneuvers, </p><p>but quickly perceived by Choke-cherry’s </p><p>excitement that something unusual was up. </p><p>He yelped to his warriors and two-score </p><p>wheeled their horses and started on a </p><p>course parallel to that of the Cheyennes. </p><p> I rode up a low hill to discover the trouble</p><p>and beheld two horsemen desperately </p><p>riding to meet the Minnetarees before the </p><p>Cheyennes could get to them. Behind me </p><p>both the Cheyenne camp and the body of </p><p>Minnetarees were in a boiling commotion. </p><p>The women accompanying our party were </p><p>hurriedly getting the horses to the rear. </p><p>Choke-cherry was bleating madly. Flat </p><p>Mouth and Miss Dearness galloped to </p><p>join me. </p><p> “Be ready! We may have to ride fast</p><p>from here. If we do we will strike for the </p><p>Mouse without going back to the Mandan </p><p>village,” said the Pillager. </p><p> I asked for an explanation. He pointed</p><p>to the two horsemen, now inside the double </p><p>line of Minnetarees. I looked and recog- </p><p>nized the head-dress of buffalo horns. </p><p> “Assiniboins!” I cried. “Why don’t the</p><p>Minnetarees kill them?” </p><p> '“They came into the village. They can</p><p>not be harmed. The Cheyennes are their </p><p>deadly enemies. Knowing the Minnetarees </p><p>are stronger today than the Cheyennes, </p><p>they foolishly followed them out here. </p><p>The Cheyennes want to kill them. The </p><p>Minnetarees say they shall not be hurt. </p><p>Instead of peace we may have a battle. If </p><p>that happens we will ride for it.” </p><p> Now the Minnetarees were returning,</p><p>the two Assiniboins in their midst. The </p><p>Cheyennes shouted furiously and gesticu- </p><p>lated with their weapons as they demanded </p><p>the surrender of the newcomers. Choke- </p><p>cherry rode up to the Cheyenne chief and </p><p>asked him to call his young men back. The </p><p>chief offered ten of his best horses for the </p><p>Assiniboins, and there was no logical </p><p>reason—the dictates of humanity aside,</p><p>of which the Minnetarees knew nothing— </p><p>why the intruders should not ha-*e been </p><p>given up. But according to the Indian </p><p>reasoning the two were safe once they </p><p>entered the village and so long as they </p><p>remained in the village. As almost all </p><p>the village had gone to visit the Cheyennes </p><p>the Assiniboins followed our road and were </p><p>held to be, theoretically, still in the village </p><p>and entitled to protection. </p><p> It was a curious example of the power</p><p>n8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>of custom. The Minnetarees were deter- </p><p>mined to protect the two hostile Indians </p><p>even if it cost them the friendship of the </p><p>Cheyennes. The men were finally brought </p><p>well within our lines, thrust into a small tent </p><p>and told to keep out of sight. Next fol- </p><p>lowed an hour of vehement speech-making. </p><p>At last the Cheyennes said they would </p><p>get their chance later. Choke-cherry was </p><p>nervous and uneasy and at once began </p><p>preparing for the ceremony. </p><p> Miss Dearness became so deeply inter-</p><p>ested in the Assiniboins that I made some </p><p>comment upon it. She replied: </p><p> “They were with those who drove us</p><p>down here. They are spies. They came </p><p>to learn if we were here, and when we are </p><p>likely to go. Their main body is in hiding </p><p>somewhere near.” </p><p> “They must not go back to tell what</p><p>they’ve learned,” I said. </p><p> “Oh, not murder,” she protested.</p><p> “Self-defense,” I grimly qualified.</p><p> I turned to the Pillager and found him</p><p>perfectly composed. He said he had known </p><p>the moment he beheld the two, that their </p><p>errand on the Knife concerned us. </p><p> I said to the girl:</p><p> “It’s very simple. I’ll get word to the</p><p>Cheyennes to watch the two and bag them </p><p>if they leave the village. Flat Mouth shall </p><p>tell them, as he talks the sign language.” </p><p>“But the war-party outside waiting to </p><p>catch us?” she murmured. </p><p>“Flat Mouth shall tell of that, too. The </p><p>Cheyennes shall go and drive them away.” </p><p>I began to feel rather obliged to the two </p><p>fellows for coming in and revealing the un- </p><p>suspected danger. </p><p> So far as I could observe, the wrangling</p><p>over the Assiniboins terminated without </p><p>any obvious gain made by either side except </p><p>that the Minnetarees kept the two Indians </p><p>alive. With the dissension smoothed away, </p><p>next came the ceremony of completing the </p><p>treaty. The terms were simple and ac-</p><p>cepted by both tribes. The alliance was </p><p>to wage war on the Sioux and their allies. </p><p>Choke-cherry, by formally adopting a Chey- </p><p>enne youth as his son, would be creating </p><p>binding ties between the tribes. The </p><p>Cheyennes, however, were reluctant to </p><p>proceed with the business. </p><p> Flat Mouth got hold of a Mandan and</p><p>learned the Cheyennes were angry that </p><p>Le Borgne did not consider the treaty of </p><p>enough importance to be present. It had </p><p>only needed the incident of the Assiniboins </p><p>to bring this resentment to the surface. </p><p>The medicine-tent was not up, nor had they </p><p>formed a smaller ceremonial horseshoe of </p><p>the white leather tents. After much argu- </p><p>ing and oratory the medicine tent was </p><p>finally erected. </p><p> Choke-cherry made a long-winded speech</p><p>and called to him Two Crows, a Minne- </p><p>taree chief, and gave to him the long pipe- </p><p>stem he had so carefully guarded from </p><p>being profaned by touching his horse. </p><p>This stem was adorned with feathers, and </p><p>Two Crows, in accepting it, danced gro- </p><p>tesquely back and forth, while two young </p><p>Minnetarees beat on a drum and rattled </p><p>antelope hoofs together. </p><p> After a certain amount of prancing,</p><p>came the ceremonial visit to the tent of the </p><p>Cheyenne who was to be adopted. Two </p><p>Crows went ahead with his thudding dance </p><p>step, and behind him danced the men with </p><p>the drum and the hoofs. We followed </p><p>with Choke-cherry. At Choke-cherry’s </p><p>command three horses were brought along. </p><p>Several pegs were pulled out, and the flaps </p><p>of the tent drawn back so that the horses </p><p>could be led inside. The three halters were </p><p>placed in the hands of a very sullen looking </p><p>young man who was seated opposite the </p><p>entrance. Two Crows danced up and </p><p>offered him the sacred stem. To the con- </p><p>sternation of Choke-cherry the stem was </p><p>haughtily waved aside. Choke-cherry tried </p><p>to reason with him, but he would not come </p><p>out of his sulks. </p><p>THE situation was growing serious. </p><p>Flat Mouth gained the side of the </p><p>Cheyenne war-chief, who was sar- </p><p>donically watching Choke-cherry’s em- </p><p>barrassment, and talked rapidly with one </p><p>hand masked by his robe. Only the chief</p><p>could read his talk, and, as he compre- </p><p>hended, his eyes darted fire. Striding to </p><p>the young man he spoke in his ear, whereat </p><p>the stem was accepted. Choke-cherry and </p><p>Two Crows now took him by the arms and </p><p>led him to the medicine-tent and seated </p><p>him beside some new red strouds—coarse </p><p>blankets. Choke-cherry sat on his right </p><p>and Two Crows on his left. The musicians </p><p>continued their efforts, and a figure danced </p><p>in with the head of a buffalo on his shoul- </p><p>ders, the nostrils and mouth of which were </p><p>stuffed with dried grass. He placed the </p><p>Gentlemen of the North </p><p>119 </p><p>skull of a bull on the ground opposite the </p><p>Cheyenne. </p><p> Now came the gift-making, and again the</p><p>Cheyennes held back. Some of the Minne- </p><p>tarees brought ammunition and placed it </p><p>on the strouds, and the Cheyenne held the </p><p>stem over it. Two Crows rose and ad- </p><p>dressed the Cheyennes, urging them to </p><p>bring something to put under the stem. </p><p>After much waiting three warriors brought </p><p>in a few robes and some dressed leather </p><p>and piled them on the ammunition. This </p><p>encouraged the Minnetarees, and they gave </p><p>three guns. The Cheyennes came back </p><p>with three poor ponies. Choke-cherry </p><p>growled and grunted in great wrath, and </p><p>his followers brought two more guns and </p><p>some corn and beans. This resulted in </p><p>another sore-backed nag from the visitors. </p><p> Then did Choke-cherry explode and</p><p>demand what the Cheyennes meant by </p><p>putting worthless creatures under the stem </p><p>when the Minnetarees were giving good </p><p>guns and powder and ball. The Cheyennes </p><p>replied they would bring good horses when </p><p>more guns were put under the stem. </p><p> Choke-cherry forgot diplomacy and</p><p>roundly accused the Cheyennes of plotting </p><p>to induce the Minnetarees to give up their </p><p>weapons so that they might be helpless </p><p>before an attack. This accusation of </p><p>treachery was immediately followed by </p><p>the Cheyennes hurrying back to the tents. </p><p>We waited, thinking they were gone to </p><p>bring more ponies. Then the warriors </p><p>outside the medicine tent began calling </p><p>out loudly, and we ran after Choke-cherry </p><p>and Two Crows and beheld the Cheyennes </p><p>striking their tents and preparing to </p><p>ride off. </p><p> The young man who was to have been</p><p>adopted galloped by us, riding one of the </p><p>gift nags, leading the others and carrying </p><p>the guns and ammunition. More than one </p><p>bow was drawn taut as he flew by, but </p><p>Choke-cherry, although convulsed with </p><p>rage, knew better than to let war come </p><p>while his brother was absent, and his stern </p><p>commands, liberally mixed with mention </p><p>of his brother’s name, saved the young </p><p>man’s life.</p><p> The Cheyennes rode off in a body. The</p><p>peace treaty had fallen through because </p><p>of the Assiniboins. Yet the Minnetarees </p><p>did not seem to attribute any blame to </p><p>them and treated them kindly as we rode </p><p>back to the village. Before arriving at </p><p>the huts Choke-cherry turned toward the </p><p>river, a mile away. On reaching it he </p><p>directed Two Crows to bring a white </p><p>buffalo hide. Flat Mouth explained to me </p><p>and the girl that Choke-cherry feared he </p><p>had handled the peace treaty badly and </p><p>anticipated his brother's anger. To guard </p><p>against this he now proposed to sacrifice </p><p>a precious white robe. Such a hide, as </p><p>I have remarked before, is the most highly </p><p>valued by the Minnetarees of all their </p><p>possessions. I could understand how the </p><p>chief’s brother was considerably worked up. </p><p> Two Crows came galloping back, not with</p><p>a whole hide, for that was a liberality that </p><p>even the gods had no right to expect, but a </p><p>long strip. This seemed to answer per- </p><p>fectly, however, and was soon placed in a </p><p>deep hole in the river and weighted down </p><p>with rocks. Choke-cherry then made a </p><p>long speech in which he said he knew what </p><p>was to blame for the Cheyennes’ behavior, </p><p>which he promised to duly report to his </p><p>brother. Having done all he could to </p><p>placate his gods, he morosely led the way </p><p>home. </p><p> “You talked with the Cheyenne chief?”</p><p>I murmured to Flat Mouth. </p><p> “He is Red Arrow, a brave warrior. He</p><p>will wait three days to go with us to the </p><p>Mouse.” </p><p> “Why is he willing to do that?” I curi-</p><p>ously asked. </p><p> “He knows I will pay him. He will make</p><p>a good trade,” was the evasive answer. </p><p> Choke-cherry halted at the first hut and,</p><p>as we rode up, he glared at me viciously </p><p>and shouted something. The Pillager in- </p><p>terpreted— </p><p> “I know what stopped me from making</p><p>peace with the Cheyennes.” </p><p> “What was it?” I asked.</p><p> “Bad medicine.”</p><p> “What was the medicine?” I knew</p><p>what he would say before he spoke. </p><p> “The hair of the white woman,” he</p><p>grunted, switching his malignant gaze to </p><p>Miss Dearness. </p><p> I warmly replied he was a fool and some</p><p>other things, and that no treaty would be </p><p>made with the Minnetarees when they took </p><p>the Assiniboin snakes along with them. </p><p> “My brother is a very wise man. We</p><p>shall see,” he replied as he rode away. </p><p> The girl had interpreted his look and had</p><p>heard Flat Mouth’s Chippewa translation, </p><p>and her hand was cold as ice as she rode </p><p>120 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>closer and placed it on mine and whis- </p><p>pered— </p><p> “It all comes back—my fear.”</p><p> “Don’t you worry a bit,” I soothed.</p><p>“We’ll get out of here flying inside of twelve </p><p>hours.’' </p><p> In my heart, however, a deadly chill was</p><p>growing. </p><p> It was now dusk, and, after leaving our</p><p>ponies at the corral, I escorted Miss Dear- </p><p>ness to the hut and lighted some bark in </p><p>the fire-hole to drive away the gloom. </p><p>Then I told her that we had better remain </p><p>where we were until morning as the ride </p><p>down the river would be dangerous. Sur- </p><p>rounding the village were innumerable pits, </p><p>eight feet or more deep, which the women </p><p>filled with corn and beans each Fall. These </p><p>were all open, and to get clear of the place </p><p>at night was to risk a broken leg or neck. </p><p> “But we must get away tonight,” she</p><p>fiercely insisted. “Any danger but this.” </p><p>She waved her hand to encompass the </p><p>whole village. “You heard what he said </p><p>about my medicine spoiling the treaty. I </p><p>care nothing for that, but there is another </p><p>danger. Oh, Mr. Franklin, you’ve been </p><p>very good and patient with me—but get me </p><p>out of here tonight!” </p><p> “Very well, we’ll go tonight, but we can’t</p><p>return to the Mandans. We must risk </p><p>crossing the Missouri at the mouth of the </p><p>Knife and striking northeast. If we waited </p><p>until tomorrow and started from the </p><p>Mandans we might find a band of Chey- </p><p>ennes waiting to act as escort. The chief </p><p>told the Pillager he would see us to the </p><p>Mouse.” </p><p> “I’d rather start from here tonight and</p><p>travel alone than wait any longer,” she </p><p>said. “Perhaps Flat Mouth could swing to </p><p>one side and pick up the Cheyennes. If </p><p>not, then a ride for it, and a clean, quick </p><p>death at the worst.” </p><p> “There must be no talk of death,” I re-</p><p>buked. “We’ll go and get through. I was </p><p>only thinking of the difficulties in getting</p><p>the horses across the Missouri, but with a </p><p>bull-boat we ought to be able to tow them </p><p>over, one at a time. Rest easy while I go </p><p>and find the Pillager and arrange for him </p><p>to get the horses from the corral.” </p><p> I had passed through the door, closed it,</p><p>and had heard the heavy bar drop across it, </p><p>when a terrific screech rang out a few huts </p><p>away and in the direction of the river. </p><p>The cry was caught up and repeated. I </p><p>stood undecided, my thumb resting on the </p><p>hammer of my gun. The door opened back </p><p>of me and she was beside me, a hand resting </p><p>on my shoulder, her head tilted as she </p><p>sought to read my face in the darkness. </p><p>The village was now in an uproar. </p><p> “The Cheyennes must be attacking in</p><p>force,” I muttered. </p><p> “It’s something very serious,” she whis-</p><p>pered. “Do you think you can manage to </p><p>get the horses up here?” </p><p> “Stay inside! Let no one in,” I said,</p><p>stepping out and blundering between the </p><p>huts, where the path in places was only a </p><p>foot in width. </p><p>I PASSED between two huts and </p><p>bumped into an Indian. His hands </p><p>struck my chest to push me aside. </p><p>Then the Pillager’s voice was whispering— </p><p>“So it is you. I knew the cloth.” </p><p> “What is the trouble? You’ve been</p><p>running?” </p><p> The last deduction was not because his</p><p>breathing was beyond normal, but because </p><p>in clutching his wrists I felt his pulse </p><p>racing. </p><p> “The Assiniboin spies will not go back</p><p>to tell what they saw here,” he hissed in </p><p>my ear. </p><p> “Good God! You’ve killed them?”</p><p>I muttered. </p><p> “Killed both. I promised the Cheyenne</p><p>chief their scalps if he would give us war- </p><p>riors to go with us to the Mouse. I told </p><p>you he would make a good trade.” </p><p> “But they’ll be after you!” I softly</p><p>cried. </p><p> “Choke-cherry thinks the Cheyennes</p><p>crept in and did it.” </p><p> “It won’t do for you to be seen. It might</p><p>make them suspicious. Don’t tell the white </p><p>woman. Stand in front of the hut. I will </p><p>bring up the horses. We must cross the </p><p>Missouri at the mouth of the Knife and ride </p><p>for it.” </p><p> “The Cheyennes will be waiting near the</p><p>Mandan village,” he protested. </p><p> “And it’s impossible to go down the river.</p><p>We would lose too much time. If the </p><p>Minnetarees chase us they will take that </p><p>direction.” </p><p> “Ho! Eshkebugecoshe, Chief of the</p><p>Pillager Chippewas, needs no help in saving </p><p>the white woman except the white woman’s </p><p>medicine.” </p><p> He thumped his breast and might have</p><p>Gentlemen of the North </p><p>121 </p><p>broken into song if I had not quieted him. </p><p> I set off, making my way toward the</p><p>center of the pandemonium which seemed </p><p>to focus around the corral. Lights were </p><p>now springing up in the open places, the </p><p>naked children dancing and piling on fuel </p><p>and looking like so many devil’s whelps. </p><p> Before I reached the corral the village</p><p>was well illumined. I met Choke-cherry, </p><p>who bawled out something I could not have </p><p>understood even if I knew his language. </p><p>But as he carried a gun and had his mouth </p><p>stuffed with balls, I assumed he was ex- </p><p>pecting an attack from the Cheyennes. </p><p>He caught my arm and led me to the door </p><p>of a hut and ordered the mob to stand </p><p>one side. As the command was obeyed </p><p>I looked down a narrow lane of humanity </p><p>and beheld the two Assiniboins. They </p><p>had been killed with a knife, and both were </p><p>scalped. </p><p> I slashed my lingers across my wrist,</p><p>the sign for the Cheyennes, and he nodded. </p><p>He stopped to harangue the crowd and I </p><p>worked clear of the shambles and hurried </p><p>on to the corral. </p><p> I reached the corral and was startled to</p><p>behold a line of mounted men riding down </p><p>a slight rise and toward me, being well </p><p>within the light of the many fires. Al- </p><p>though they were continually descending </p><p>the rise, the head of the line never reached </p><p>the corral. I watched for a minute, </p><p>greatly puzzled. Then a stentorian voice </p><p>rose with such tremendous volume as to </p><p>carry a great distance. It was repeated </p><p>several times and was answered from the </p><p>center of the village. In another moment </p><p>several Indians came running by the corral, </p><p>one of them swinging a torch. I recognized </p><p>Choke-cherry and the Pillager in the group. </p><p> I called out to him and I knew he heard</p><p>me, yet he kept on with the others to find </p><p>the man with the loud voice. Knowing </p><p>he would return when he had finished his </p><p>errand, I proceeded to pick out our animals. </p><p>As I led them out of the enclosure a warrior </p><p>caught my arm and pointed interrogatively </p><p>at the nags. I pointed out toward the</p><p>open plain and then made the sign for </p><p>Cheyenne and indicated I was taking the </p><p>horses into a hut. He nodded and hurried </p><p>on. I started to lead them away and a </p><p>hand fell on my shoulder, and the Pillager </p><p>was wrenching the halter ropes from my </p><p>hands and hurriedly driving the ponies back </p><p>into the corral. </p><p> “Why do you do that?” I demanded.</p><p> “Bad medicine at work,” he gloomily</p><p>answered. “Le Borgne comes back from </p><p>the hunt. Did you not hear his voice? </p><p>When he heard the noise in the village he </p><p>knew something was wrong and has thrown </p><p>a hundred of his hunters around the village </p><p>with orders to shoot any one trying to leave </p><p>it. We must stay.” </p><p> Without a word I followed him back</p><p>through the excited throngs. Some per- </p><p>verse agency seemed to be thwarting us. </p><p>Something of the girl’s strange fear began </p><p>to assail me. It was not Le Borgne, for a </p><p>ball from my double-barrel would nicely </p><p>eliminate him. It was, rather, that the </p><p>whole village stood for ruthless and brutal </p><p>domination through physical strength. </p><p>When I came to the hut, tapped on the </p><p>door, and gave my name, I was confront- </p><p>ing the hardest task I had ever encountered. </p><p> TO BE CONCLUDED.</p><p>Author ot “The Snake,” and “The Sloth.” </p><p>I WOULD not attack that spider again, </p><p>senhor, if I were you. You have seen </p><p>for yourself that you can not hit him. </p><p>■^*No matter how quickly you strike, he </p><p>is inches away when the blow falls. </p><p> Those huge, bird-killing spiders all are</p><p>incredibly swift. I have heard that not </p><p>even a bullet is fast enough to kill one— </p><p>that at the flash of the gun he jumps so </p><p>quickly that the whole seven inches of him </p><p>is out of danger when the shot strikes. </p><p>Whether that be true or not, I know you </p><p>will never hit him with your fist; you will </p><p>only tire yourself out. Besides, he may </p><p>grow angry and attack you in return. </p><p>His fangs are half an inch long, senhor, and </p><p>he is full of poison. It js not wise to risk </p><p>his springing at y&lt;ju. </p><p> This is an odd place to find such a mon-</p><p>ster—here in the middle of the broad </p><p>Amazon, on a steamer outward bound </p><p>toward the Atlantic. Yet strange creatures </p><p>sometimes come aboard these river-boats </p><p>while they are tied up at the bank. Some </p><p>of them are harmless, and some are deadly. </p><p>And not all of the deadly things are found </p><p>on the outgoing steamers, nor are they </p><p>all bred here in the jungle. </p><p> Sometimes they come up the river from</p><p>the outside and are the more deadly because </p><p>they are human. The memory of one of </p><p>them came into my mind just now while I </p><p>watched that great spider leaping aside </p><p>from your blows. He, too, was called </p><p>the “Spider,” that man, though his name </p><p>was Schwartz. </p><p> What is that? You say that schwarz</p><p>means “black”? That is very droll, senhor, </p><p>for the Spider was black. Black of hair, </p><p>black of beard, black of eye he was—yes, </p><p>and black of heart, too, though at first we </p><p>did not know that. We called him Spider </p><p>because he looked like one. His little </p><p>eyes were set close together with a sort of </p><p>spidery look in them. His body was small </p><p>and bunchy, while his arms were long and </p><p>thin and covered with black hair. His legs </p><p>were short and crooked. Yet he could run </p><p>amazingly fast on those little legs; that </p><p>made him seen all the more like a spider. </p><p>And later he made himself a spider’s lair— </p><p>and came to a spider’s end.</p><p> An up-river boat brought him to us one</p><p>day, and with him a small brown bag and </p><p>a rifle. He had no letters to Coronel </p><p>Nunes, owner of the great rubber estate </p><p>where I worked, nor anything else to show </p><p>who he was or whence he had come. The </p><p>coronel, however, received him with the </p><p>courtesy he shows to all who come to him; </p><p>and when this man told him he had had </p><p>another bag, containing letters of intro- </p><p>duction and other things of value, but that </p><p>it had been stolen from him on the boat, </p><p>the coronel believed him—or at any rate </p><p>seemed to, for theft is a tiling that may </p><p>happen to any man in almost any place. </p><p> Schwartz boldly-made himself at home</p><p>there at the headquarters and talked </p><p>vaguely about looking over the country </p><p>for the people he said he represented. He </p><p>went out in ihe jungle with us men and saw </p><p>all he could see. Always he carried two </p><p>weapons—the rifle, and a pistol. </p><p> It may be a foolish fancy, senhores,</p><p>but I have sometimes thought that a man </p><p>may be judged by his weapons, and not </p><p>only the man himself, but the country </p><p>The Spider </p><p>123 </p><p>whence he comes—for a man usually </p><p>carries the weapons made in his own land. </p><p>Now you two Americans, I have noticed, </p><p>carry with you that flat pistol made by the </p><p>Senhor Colt, which you say was used by </p><p>your army in the war in Europe. There </p><p>is about it a square, solid look which fits </p><p>well with the things I have observed about </p><p>you and with what I have heard about </p><p>your great country. Also, the shape of </p><p>that pistol is such that it seems to say— </p><p> “I do not seek trouble with any man,</p><p>but if any man wants it—I am ready.” </p><p> Your Winchesters, too, have something</p><p>of that same air of solid readiness. </p><p> The guns of the Spider had a much</p><p>different appearance. The pistol looked </p><p>venomous; it leaned forward from the </p><p>ugly butt to the thin muzzle, as if always </p><p>eager to kill. It reminded me of a striking </p><p>snake. The name of it, he once told me, </p><p>was a Loo—let me see—ah yes, that is it, </p><p>senhor—a Luger. The rifle, too, looked </p><p>wicked, but I can not remember its name; </p><p>it does not matter. But that pistol and </p><p>the look of the spidery man who carried it </p><p>were such that, when he was following </p><p>behind me in the bush, I got a cold feeling </p><p>between my shoulder-blades, as if death </p><p>were about to strike me in the back. </p><p> My mates, too. said that they had the</p><p>same feeling when he was behind them; </p><p>yet he gave us no real cause for it. He did </p><p>not bluster nor threaten us by word or act. </p><p>Indeed, he was very quiet. He had the </p><p>spider’s way of remaining still in one place </p><p>for a long time, watching everything and </p><p>making no move. It might be our work </p><p>that he watched, or it might be something </p><p>in the jungle that aroused his interest; but </p><p>whatever it was, you felt that when he </p><p>stopped looking at it he had seen everything </p><p>about it and remembered it all. </p><p> One thing that amused us was his habit</p><p>of watching other spiders—real spiders of </p><p>the bush, which we often met. No matter </p><p>what sort of spider it might lie he would </p><p>study it and learn its .ways and how </p><p>it lived and got its prey. When he did </p><p>this we would wink at one another and</p><p>laugh behind our hands, and one of my </p><p>mates named Pedro—a tall, handsome </p><p>young fellowr who was very droll—would </p><p>pretend to pounce on something, and then </p><p>say under his breath: </p><p> “Take care, little spider, the big Spider</p><p>will eat you!” </p><p> It seemed very funny to us at the time.</p><p>But later on things came about which made </p><p>it not funny at all. </p><p> After he had been among us for some</p><p>time, another boat came. It brought us </p><p>welcome guests: the coroncl's daughter, who </p><p>had journeyed all the way from Rio to </p><p>visit him, and her cousin, a gentleman of </p><p>Rio, Senhor Affonso da Fonseca. Every </p><p>year the Senhorita Flora made this long </p><p>trip from the great city where she was </p><p>receiving the finest education the coronet's </p><p>wealth could give her, to see her lonely old </p><p>father. And though he would never allow </p><p>her to remain very long, lest she become ill </p><p>from the climate or meet some mischance </p><p>from snakes or other things, we all knew </p><p>that he looked forward to these short visits </p><p>of hers as the brightest days of all the </p><p>year. </p><p> We knew, too, that he planned eventually</p><p>to make his own home again in Rio, where </p><p>he had lived until his wife died. And we </p><p>knew also that Senhor Alfonso, who was </p><p>somewhat older than the senhorita, had a </p><p>deeper feeling for her than that of a cousin, </p><p>and that, though he accompanied her </p><p>partly because he was interested in our </p><p>rubber country and partly because he felt </p><p>it his duty to protect her on the long jour- </p><p>ney, he came more for the pleasure of being </p><p>with her. We were glad of this, Jor she </p><p>was a 'handsome, gracious girl—the true </p><p>daughter of her father—while the senhor </p><p>was every inch a man and would make her </p><p>a fine husband. The coronet himself ap- </p><p>proved the match. </p><p> NOW it happened just at this time</p><p>that I met with a rather bad acci- </p><p>dent in the bush—my right leg was </p><p>cut by a nuichete—and so I had to go back </p><p>to headquarters to let the injury heal. </p><p>My old coronet had a very friendly feeling </p><p>for me because in past days I had done </p><p>some dangerous things for him which many </p><p>men would not have done. So, while I was</p><p>recovering from my hurt, he often had me </p><p>come to the house and sit and talk to him, </p><p>and, being there, I saw a number of </p><p>things. </p><p> For one thing, I noticed that the Spider</p><p>stopped going into the jungle so much. </p><p>He stayed around the headquarters, sitting </p><p>quiet for hours in that spidery way of his </p><p>and watching the senhorita or Senhor </p><p>Affonso. Sometimes he talked, in his </p><p>124 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>throaty foreign way, and the others an- </p><p>swered him with all politeness, but I could </p><p>see that none of them liked him. </p><p> The coronel was displeased at the way</p><p>the Spider’s eyes followed his daughter, and </p><p>the girl herself avoided him. Senhor Af- </p><p>fonso, though, was much interested some- </p><p>times by the black-bearded man’s talk of </p><p>things he had studied in the jungle, and </p><p>now and then he went out with him to see </p><p>those things for himself. At such times </p><p>I always felt uneasy, and Senhorita Flora, </p><p>too, kept watching anxiously until they </p><p>returned. </p><p> Mind you, senhores, the Spider never had</p><p>done anything to make us distrust him. </p><p>But dark crimes can easily be committed </p><p>when two men are alone in the bush, and </p><p>we knew that Senhor Affonso was wealthy </p><p>and that, no doubt, he had a tempting sum </p><p>of milreis with him; and, as I have said, </p><p>there was that about the Spider which made </p><p>one feel that it would not be well to trust </p><p>him too far. So I always felt relieved </p><p>when the Rio gentleman came back un- </p><p>harmed, and I knew the senhorita did also, </p><p>though she never spoke of what was in her </p><p>mind. </p><p> Then one day a man of ours reported</p><p>seeing a splendid black jaguar in the forest, </p><p>and Senhor Affonso and the Spider went to </p><p>hunt it. They made the longest trip they </p><p>had yet taken, for they were gone tfto days. </p><p>This time we were more at ease about them, </p><p>however, for by the coronel's order two of </p><p>our men went with them—the man who </p><p>had seen the jaguar and another who was a </p><p>good hunter. </p><p> Not long after they departed,another boat</p><p>came. It was the one which had brought </p><p>the Spider to us. My leg was better now, </p><p>though still stiff, and I limped down to </p><p>watch the unloading of the • supplies. As </p><p>I started, the coronel asked me to request </p><p>the captain to come up for a moment. I </p><p>did so and thought no more of it. After </p><p>the boat went, though, I noticed that the </p><p>coronel seem disturbed. At times his eyes </p><p>would snap angrily and then he would walk </p><p>up and down, his face wrinkled in thought. </p><p>I asked no questions, of course, but after</p><p>the Spider and Senhor Affonso returned </p><p>I soon learned what was the matter. </p><p> They had found the jaguar, and brought</p><p>with them his great, glossy hide, which </p><p>Senhor Affonso proudly showed to the girl </p><p>and her father. </p><p> “It shall go back to Rio with us,” he said,</p><p>looking at Flora, and there Was that in his </p><p>face which added: “And some day, beloved, </p><p>it shall be in our home.” </p><p> She smiled and blushed a little, dropping</p><p>her eyes. </p><p> I do not know why I did it, but I glanced</p><p>at the Spider to see if he wat-ched this. </p><p>I saw he did and that a nasty expression </p><p>crossed his face. The coronel saw this too, </p><p>and his mouth tightened. When the others </p><p>started into the house he said— </p><p> “Senhor Schwartz, I would speak with</p><p>you.” </p><p> I turned to go away. But, as I have said,</p><p>my leg was stiff, and I had to walk slowly—• </p><p>and I will admit that I did not try very </p><p>hard to hasten, for I knew the coronel was </p><p>about to say something worth hearing. </p><p>Before I had gone far the old gentleman </p><p>spoke: </p><p> “Senhor, you have now made me quite</p><p>a long visit. I have greatly enjoyed your </p><p>companionship and I am grieved that in </p><p>this poor home of mine I have been unable </p><p>to offer you better entertainment. I trust, </p><p>however, that the little I could do to show </p><p>you the workings of the estate has been </p><p>of some assistance to you, and that on your </p><p>departure you will carry with you many </p><p>pleasant memories.” </p><p> The Spider said nothing. So the corond</p><p>added— </p><p> “It is with sorrow that I learn that you</p><p>are to leave us on the next boat.” </p><p> After a pause the Spider said:</p><p> “Ya, I see. It is because I lost that bag</p><p>mit my papers.” </p><p> “Pardon, senhor,” said the coronel, “but</p><p>the Aurora was here yesterday, and as you</p><p>are my guest I asked the captain if any </p><p>trace of your black bag, of which you told </p><p>me, had been found. He told me, senhor, </p><p>that you had no black bag whatever—only </p><p>the brown one which you brought here, </p><p>and that nothing had been taken from you. </p><p>No doubt there is some mistake. Yet I </p><p>have known this captain for years, and I </p><p>know him to be honest and truthful.” </p><p>There was another pause. Just as I </p><p>passed out of hearing the Spider said— </p><p> “He is a-liar, but I will go.”</p><p> I heard him walk into the house.</p><p> As no boat was expected for a time,</p><p>things went on as before. I said nothing </p><p>of what I had overheard and I know the </p><p>coronel did not tell the others, for he is the </p><p>The Spider </p><p>125 </p><p>very soul of hospitality and it had cost him </p><p>an unpleasant struggle to do what he had </p><p>to do. The Spider went out into the bush </p><p>a few times alone and returned and talked </p><p>of various things he had seen. Then one </p><p>morning he and Senhor Affonso went out </p><p>together, to look at something or other </p><p>this black-hearted man said he had found. </p><p> I watched them go and I became more</p><p>uneasy than ever before. I wanted to </p><p>follow, but my leg was not yet good enough </p><p>to let me travel easily and noiselessly; so </p><p>I looked about, and my eye fell on young </p><p>Pedro, the droll fellow who used to pretend </p><p>to devour spiders. I beckoned to him and </p><p>whispered to him to follow the pair and </p><p>keep out of sight. He did so at once. </p><p>TIME passed, and a sort of drowsi- </p><p>ness had crept upon me, when </p><p>there came a sound—a sound like </p><p>a shot, some distance away and muffled </p><p>by the bush. I sprang awake and listened. </p><p>Suddenly I remembered that Pedro had </p><p>not taken his rifle—only the machete he </p><p>always carried at his belt. Senhor Affonso, </p><p>though, had a gun with him and he might </p><p>be shooting at some animal. </p><p> Before long there came two other shots.</p><p>These were nearer than the first and sounded </p><p>like the spiteful crack of the Luger. I got </p><p>up and went to my quarters to get my rifle. </p><p>Senhorita Flora who had heard the shots </p><p>too, come out and called to me— </p><p>“Lourenfo, what is it?” </p><p> But I made no answer and went on as</p><p>fast as a lame man could. </p><p> I was just coming out with the gun when</p><p>Flora’s name was called from the edge of </p><p>the forest. There stood the Spider. </p><p> “Come quickly, senhorita ” he said.</p><p>“Affonso has met with an accident.” </p><p> She started running toward him. I</p><p>called— </p><p> “Do not go, senhorita! Wait!”</p><p> But she kept on, and I began to run too.</p><p>Then the Spider stopped us both. He</p><p>fired at me. </p><p> The bullet missed me so narrowly that</p><p>I felt it pass my face. I dodged, my </p><p>clumsy stiff leg twisted, and I fell sprawling. </p><p>When I looked up the girl had whirled and </p><p>was running back to the house. </p><p> The Spider, who thought he had killed</p><p>me, was running after her with all his </p><p>spidery speed. My rifle had fallen from </p><p>my hand, and while I was getting it he </p><p>caught her. He dragged her back toward </p><p>the jungle. She struggled to escape, and </p><p>he struck her so hard that he dazed her. </p><p>Then he picked her up and ran, but I had </p><p>my rifle now. </p><p> I fired from where I lay, aiming low,</p><p>trying to hit his crooked legs and so avoid </p><p>injuring Flora. But I shot hurriedly and </p><p>missed him. Still, my shooting stopped </p><p>him, for when he saw I was alive he swung </p><p>the girl toward me and, using her as a </p><p>shield, fired at me again. </p><p> As you perhaps know, a man lying down</p><p>is hard to hit, but his bullet ripped across </p><p>my shoulders and tore the shirt from my </p><p>back and burned my skin. I could not </p><p>shoot again without striking the senhorita, </p><p>so I did not try. </p><p> Then came a burst of fire from the house,</p><p>where the coronel had seized weapons. </p><p>Now he came bounding out like a jaguar, </p><p>with a pistol in each hand spitting flame </p><p>and lead, as he ran. Somewhere behind </p><p>me, too, a rifle barked, fired by some man </p><p>about the place. </p><p> Of course, both the coronel and the work-</p><p>man shot high, lest they kill Flora. But </p><p>the Spider, thinking only of himself, had </p><p>no time to realize this. Finding himself </p><p>under fire from two directions and hearing </p><p>yells of rage as other men ran for their </p><p>guns, he suddenly dropped the girl and ran, </p><p>diving into the bush. </p><p> I shot at him again as he fled, but again</p><p>I missed. Then we all hastened to Flora, </p><p>whom the coronel had caught up in his </p><p>arms. For the moment we forgot every- </p><p>thing but her. Then, still stunned by the </p><p>blow of the Spider, she moaned— </p><p>“Affonso!”</p><p> We all started and looked at one another,</p><p>and I said— </p><p> “Yes, Senhor Affonso must have been</p><p>shot—and Pedro, too.” </p><p> I explained how I had sent Pedro to</p><p>follow. The coronel snapped: </p><p> “Go, men, and find them! And find</p><p>that—that Schwartz, too!” </p><p> We growled. The Spider would not</p><p>come back alive if we found him. But we </p><p>did not find him, for he had vanished. We </p><p>pressed on to find our own people. I could </p><p>not keep up with the others, but I was not </p><p>far behind when they met Pedro. He </p><p>came staggering down an old estrada, his </p><p>face twisted with pain, and he bore the </p><p>body of Senhor Affonso. </p><p>12b </p><p>Adventure </p><p> At first we believed that body to be dead,</p><p>for it hung limp and there were two bullet- </p><p>holes in it, but while we were cutting down </p><p>branches to make a litter Senhor Alfonso </p><p>stirred and moaned. Pedro cried out joy- </p><p>ously: </p><p> “He lives! The senhor lives!”</p><p> Then he dropped, did Pedro, fainting</p><p>from loss of blood, for he, too, had been </p><p>shot by the Spider, and his wound was bad, </p><p>near the shoulder. So now we had two </p><p>men to carry home. </p><p> As I learned later, this was what had</p><p>happened: </p><p> The Spider had told Senhor Affonso he</p><p>had found a trap-door spider’s nest which </p><p>was quite the most wonderful thing he </p><p>had ever seen, and the senhor, greatly </p><p>interested, went with him into a place </p><p>where no men were working. There the </p><p>Spider pointed to a hole at the base of a </p><p>large tree, with thick spider-webbing across </p><p>it, and said that was it. </p><p> If the city gentleman had been better</p><p>acquainted with spiders he would have </p><p>known that no trap-door spider would </p><p>ever make such a nest, but that it would </p><p>be concealed so that it could not be seen </p><p>at all. But he went up to it, and then </p><p>the man Schwartz said— </p><p> “Look closely, Affonso, and see how a</p><p>spider acts when he is cornered!” </p><p> Then he shot him in the back.</p><p> The only thing that saved the senhor was</p><p>that, even as he bent to look, he sensed </p><p>something treacherous in the Spider’s </p><p>words and turned to see his face. The </p><p>bullet struck him before he had turned </p><p>half-way, but he had twisted so far that, </p><p>instead of going into his heart, it went </p><p>through him sidewise and came out under </p><p>his right arm. The shock threw him for- </p><p>ward and his head struck hard against </p><p>the tree, knocking him senseless. </p><p> The Spider, thinking him dead, swiftly</p><p>robbed him of every thing valuable—though</p><p>he did not get so much as he probably ex- </p><p>pected, for the senhor had put most of his </p><p>money in the coronel’s safe soon after his </p><p>arrival. Then he dashed back to carry </p><p>off the handsome Senhorita Flora, but on </p><p>the way he met Pedro. </p><p> Pedro, not wishing the pair to know he</p><p>was there, had followed at some distance </p><p>and, though he heard the shot, he did not </p><p>see the shooting and could not be sure of </p><p>what it meant. So, with his machete ready, </p><p>he sought to stop the Spider and question </p><p>him. Without a word the Spider shot him, </p><p>too, firing twice. The first bullet knocked </p><p>him down in the thick bush and the second </p><p>missed. When he struggled up again the </p><p>Spider was gone. Since the first thing </p><p>to do was to find Senhor Affonso, he went </p><p>and found him. </p><p>FOR some time it seemed that </p><p>both Pedro and the senhor would die. </p><p>But both were strong, and at last </p><p>they recovered. While they lay there we </p><p>hunted the Spider, but found nothing at all; </p><p>he had disappeared as if he never had </p><p>been there. It was during this time, too, </p><p>that we learned what he meant by his </p><p>double-tongued advice to Senhor Affonso </p><p>to see what a cornered spider would do, </p><p>for there came a boat, and with it two quiet, </p><p>common-looking men who talked with the </p><p>coronel and went out into the bush with </p><p>our men. They finally left without telling </p><p>their business to any one except the coronel. </p><p>When they had gone we learned with </p><p>surprize that they were police. We also </p><p>found that they sought the Spider, and </p><p>that he was wanted in Para for murder, </p><p>and at Manaos for—worse than murder. </p><p> So you see that though he could not</p><p>know the law was so close behind him, he </p><p>did know he could not go back down the </p><p>river on the next boat. He had reached </p><p>the last place where he could live among </p><p>men, and now there was no place left for </p><p>him but the jungle. </p><p> My leg was well long before the senhor</p><p>and Pedro were, and I went back to work. </p><p>I heard, though, that Senhor Affonso </p><p>vowed he would stay there until he had </p><p>hunted down the man who had shot him </p><p>and assailed the lady Flora, if it took the </p><p>rest of his life.</p><p> The senhorita was even more bitter</p><p>against that man than Affonso himself— </p><p>not so much because he had attacked her </p><p>as because he had nearly killed her sweet- </p><p>heart. That is the way of women. Yet </p><p>she pleaded with him not to seek the </p><p>Spider, as he might be killed in doing so. </p><p>The coronel, too, pointed out that he was </p><p>city-bred and not fitted for man-hunting </p><p>in such terrible country as ours, that the </p><p>Spider must have perished in the jungle, </p><p>and that even the police had abandoned </p><p>the idea of looking for him. Pedro, for </p><p>whom the senhor now had much affection, </p><p>The Spider </p><p>127 </p><p>also urged him to change his mind, and said: </p><p> “Leave him to me, senhor. He is mine</p><p>as well as yours, and I know the forest </p><p>far better than you. If ever I find him, </p><p>he dies.” </p><p> And so he was dissuaded, and finally</p><p>he and Flora went back to Rio. </p><p>WE HAD long given up the Spider </p><p>as dead, for he had not much </p><p>ammunition and no way of getting </p><p>more. Thus his weapons would soon </p><p>become useless, and then he could kill no </p><p>game to eat. We had decided he was dead, </p><p>I say, when strange things began to occur. </p><p>The first of these was the disappearance of </p><p>Custodio Barros. </p><p> We were working far out from head-</p><p>quarters at the time, in new rubber land, </p><p>and we needed more supplies. Custodio </p><p>was sent down the river in his canoe to get </p><p>them. A long time went by, and he did </p><p>not return. </p><p> Then we sent another man. Before he</p><p>had gone far he met two boats coming up </p><p>from headquarters, and when he asked </p><p>what ailed Custodio, the men in the boats </p><p>were astonished, for they thought he had </p><p>returned to us. They said he had come, </p><p>got his supplies and started back; since </p><p>then nothing had been seen or heard of him. </p><p>Their own action in bringing more supplies </p><p>had nothing to do with him, but was the </p><p>usual arrangement. They said they would </p><p>keep a sharp lookout on the way back to </p><p>see if any trace ‘of him could be found, </p><p>but they discovered no trace at all. </p><p> This, of course, caused much talk and</p><p>argument among us. Custodio was an </p><p>honest fellow and even if he had not been </p><p>he would hardly have run away with a few </p><p>supplies. He might have gone ashore </p><p>and been killed by a snake or a jaguar, </p><p>or he might have been drowned, or devoured </p><p>by alligators or piranhas. None of those </p><p>things, however, would have destroyed </p><p>his canoe, and the empty canoe would have </p><p>been seen by some one. It might be that </p><p>Indians had killed him and taken all he had, </p><p>but this did not seem likely. Each of us</p><p>had his own idea of what might have </p><p>happened, but none of us knew anything </p><p>more than the fact that he was lost. </p><p> Gumercindo Penria was the next. He</p><p>was a steady, thrifty man who had worked </p><p>among us for a long time and had never </p><p>gambled. He had accumulated a large </p><p>account with the coronel. He had a little </p><p>family at a place well down the river, and </p><p>now the longing for home had grown too </p><p>strong in him. and he was going out. </p><p> The coronel, who is always very kind to</p><p>those who serve him well, not only paid </p><p>him his due but gave him a handsome </p><p>present besides, so that he was quite rich </p><p>for a man of this region. Yet, partly </p><p>because he was so thrifty and partly be- </p><p>cause the home fever was burning strong </p><p>in him, he would not wait for a regular boat </p><p>and go home as a paying passenger, but </p><p>started at once in his own canoe. </p><p> Since he was going down-river, the</p><p>coronel asked him to bear a message to </p><p>some of our men working some distance </p><p>below headquarters, telling them to come </p><p>in, as he had decided to send them into </p><p>another place. Gumercindo gladly prom- </p><p>ised to do so. </p><p> The men did not come in, and, after</p><p>waiting awhile, the coronel sent another </p><p>man with the same message. This time </p><p>the men came promptly. They said, </p><p>senhores, that Gumercindo not only had </p><p>given them no message, but he had never </p><p>passed their camp! </p><p> At this the coronel was much perplexed,</p><p>and after turning things over in his mind </p><p>he sent two men all the way to Gumer- </p><p>cindo’s home to see if he had arrived there. </p><p>He had not. Nobody knew anything at </p><p>all about him. Nowhere between the </p><p>headquarters and his home was there any </p><p>sign of him. He, too, had disappeared. </p><p> This alarmed and angered all of us.</p><p>Searching parties went out with orders to </p><p>find the lost man or some trace of him, </p><p>and they hunted all along both banks and </p><p>sent word far down the river to seek him. </p><p>But nothing was found; neither Gumer- </p><p>cindo himself, nor his canoe, nor even his </p><p>hat.</p><p> After that no man traveled alone. We</p><p>felt that some terrible thing was on the </p><p>river, though what it might be we could </p><p>not guess. We made note of one thing, </p><p>though—that both of these men had dis- </p><p>appeared with something of value. Cus- </p><p>todio had vanished with some supplies; </p><p>Gumercindo with money. Men who had </p><p>nothing were not molested. Still, the fact </p><p>that both of those lost men had been alone </p><p>when they were destroyed made us want </p><p>to travel in pairs, whether we had anything </p><p>or not. For a time this worked well. </p><p>128 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Nothing happened to any of us, except the </p><p>usual accidents and hazards of our work. </p><p> Thiyi came something that struck dread</p><p>deeper into our hearts. Two men dis- </p><p>appeared together, and with them a whole </p><p>boat-load of valuable supplies. One of </p><p>them, Lucas Macicl, was a rather simple </p><p>fellow and slow of thought, but the other. </p><p>Saldanha Saraiva, was a man of quick wit </p><p>and much experience on the river, whose </p><p>only weakness was a fondness for women. </p><p>They were bound up-stream when they </p><p>were last seen, and somewhere between </p><p>that point and our workings the mys- </p><p>terious Death which haunted the river </p><p>reached out and seized them, their boat </p><p>and all they had. As before, no trace was </p><p>left behind. </p><p> While we were searching along the banks</p><p>and back in the jungle for any sign of what </p><p>had happened to these mates of ours, a </p><p>fifth man was swallowed up. Antonio </p><p>Maciel, he was—a brother of Lucas. This </p><p>time the Death struck not on the water, </p><p>but in the jungle. </p><p> Antonio was one of several men who were</p><p>beating through the bush, strung out in a </p><p>long fine with wide spaces between them, </p><p>and he was at the end of the line nearest the </p><p>stream. After a time the man next to him </p><p>found that Antonio was not answering </p><p>his calls. He cut his way toward where </p><p>Antonio should have been. He was not </p><p>there, nor had he reached that place. There </p><p>was no trace of him. He was gone, as if </p><p>the ground had opened under him and </p><p>closed again. The last sign of him was a </p><p>place where he had slashed some vines with </p><p>his machete. </p><p> This was too much. Men now feared</p><p>to work—to go in canoes—to do anything. </p><p>They were not cowards, these comrades </p><p>of mine, but the mystery and silence of this </p><p>awful Death that left no trace was more </p><p>than they could stand. Some crossed </p><p>themselves and said it was no mortal thing, </p><p>but a demon. No man knew when or </p><p>where it would strike him down, for it </p><p>had seized Antonio, who was on land and </p><p>had nothing but liis weapons, just as it </p><p>had devoured the men on the water who</p><p>had money or supplies. Though our work </p><p>went on, we toiled always with a cold feeling </p><p>on our backs, and went always by twos or </p><p>threes. There was not one of us who did </p><p>not shudder at the mention of this mysteri- </p><p>ous Death. </p><p> NOW Pedro had recovered from</p><p>his bullet-wound and was back at </p><p>work with me, we had many talks </p><p>about this thing which we called the </p><p>Death, but none of them got us anywhere. </p><p>Yet, through these talks, we got into the </p><p>habit of being together, and where one of </p><p>us went the other went too. So when I </p><p>was told to go to headquarters and fetch </p><p>back some things that were needed in our </p><p>work, Pedro came with me. At the head- </p><p>quarters I got what we had been sent for </p><p>and, as the things were few, I gave them </p><p>over to Pedro to put into the canoe while </p><p>I told the coronel how all was going at our </p><p>tamo up the river. When I came out and </p><p>saw our canoe I was astonished. It seemed </p><p>to be full of supplies. </p><p> “What is this, Pedro?” I asked.</p><p> He smiled his odd smile, and answered:</p><p>“It is bait. The boxes and bags are </p><p>filled with trash.” And as I stared at him </p><p>he added: “The Death strikes at men with </p><p>full canoes, Lourengo. I would see what </p><p>this Death looks like.” </p><p> “Are you mad?” I cried angrily. “Is</p><p>there not danger enough without inviting </p><p>more?” </p><p> “Perhaps so,” he said, his brown eyes</p><p>dancing. “If you are afraid, we will leave </p><p>this bait behind.” </p><p> Of course that silenced me, as he knew</p><p>it would. We pushed off and paddled </p><p>away with our worthless cargo. After </p><p>we swung into our long-distance stroke </p><p>some of his recklessness crept into me too, </p><p>and I began to look forward to meeting </p><p>the Death and fighting it. </p><p> The only thing we did meet, however,</p><p>was far from what we half expected. At a </p><p>place where a slow, quiet creek flowed into </p><p>the river, a soft call came to us, and as we </p><p>looked we saw standing there an Indian </p><p>woman. We held the canoe steady and </p><p>stared at her.</p><p> She was a magnificent woman, for she</p><p>was tall and shapely, deep-bosomed and </p><p>full-hipped, and she looked as strong as a </p><p>man; her face, too, was really handsome. </p><p>She laughed and beckoned to us. Pedro </p><p>laughed back, waved his hand and asked </p><p>her what she would have of us; she made </p><p>some answer, but we could not understand </p><p>it, for we did not know her tongue. Then </p><p>she waved to us again to come ashore. </p><p> Pedro, who was in the bow, drove his</p><p>paddle into the river to do so, but I backed </p><p>The Spider </p><p>129 </p><p>water and held the canoe where it was, </p><p>for, though the things we had been sent </p><p>for were few, they were badly needed at </p><p>our tambo and we were under orders to </p><p>waste no time. When Pedro scowled at </p><p>me I reminded him of this and told him I </p><p>had had enough of his foolishness and that </p><p>we would go on at once. Still, we stayed </p><p>there a few minutes, out on the water, </p><p>while he and the woman talked back and </p><p>forth without understanding each other </p><p>at all. Then we went on, paddling fast </p><p>to make up for lost time. </p><p> The sight of this woman had surprized</p><p>us much, for we knew of no Indians along </p><p>that stream—their country was farther </p><p>west and south. Had she been a man it </p><p>would not have seemed so strange, for the </p><p>savages are rovers and hunt for long dis- </p><p>tances away from their homes; but a woman, </p><p>all alone on the bank, was something to be </p><p>wondered at. We puzzled about her as </p><p>we went on and concluded that a band of </p><p>the Indians must be living near the stream </p><p>for a time, as she certainly would never be </p><p>there unless some men were about. As I </p><p>have said, she was the only person we saw </p><p>on all our trip. The mysterious Death </p><p>never molested us. So, when we neared </p><p>our journey’s end, I said: </p><p> “Let us now throw this bait overboard.</p><p>It has caught no fish.” </p><p> “Very well,” said Pedro, and we drew up</p><p>to the bank to do so. </p><p> But suddenly, as he reached for the first</p><p>bag, a strange look dawned in his face, as </p><p>if a great thought had struck him. </p><p> “Lourengo!” he said hoarsely. “That</p><p>woman—I wonder if she too was bait!” </p><p> I frowned at him, wondering what he</p><p>meant, but he did not explain. Instead, </p><p>he said: </p><p> “We will not throw away our bait. We</p><p>will hide it and use it again. Say nothing </p><p>of the woman, Lourenfo. I have an idea, </p><p>and later you shall know what it is.” </p><p> So we hid all the trash beside the water,</p><p>and marked a tree so that we could find it </p><p>again, and went on to the tambo. </p><p> Now in this gang of ours there was a</p><p>silent, surly man who had been a lone </p><p>rubber-picker in very wild parts of Peru </p><p>and Bolivia, and who knew Indian tongues. </p><p>He was said to be a refugee from both coun- </p><p>tries because he had killed men there, and </p><p>most of us left him alone as much as </p><p>ssible. </p><p> Now I observed, however, that Pedro</p><p>was with him a good deal. Pedro was the </p><p>sort of man who can make friends with </p><p>any one, and even this sour, suspicious killer </p><p>liked him. What they talked about Pedro </p><p>did not tell me, and I asked 110 questions. </p><p>This went on for a time, and then one night </p><p>Pedro took the gang-boss aside and talked </p><p>with him. After that he came and told me </p><p>to clean my rifle and prepare to go down- </p><p>river, and in the morning we went. </p><p> At the place where the marked tree stood</p><p>we got our bait again, and arranged it so </p><p>that it looked much different than before. </p><p>Then we went on down-stream, ready for </p><p>anything that might come, but nothing </p><p>came. </p><p> When we reached the place where we</p><p>had seen the woman, we held the canoe, </p><p>and Pedro gave an odd cry like a bird. I </p><p>recognized the call as one he had been </p><p>practising since he began talking wfth the </p><p>Peruvian outlaw. We listened, but neither </p><p>heard nor saw anything, so we went on. </p><p>At intervals he called again, and at last </p><p>there floated back the same call from the </p><p>jungle. We stopped the canoe where it </p><p>it was. Pedro called again, and again </p><p>came the reply. Soon a figure appeared </p><p>among the trees, and we saw the savage </p><p>woman. </p><p> “Hold your rifle ready, Lourenfo,” he</p><p>whispered. </p><p> I seized the gun and cocked it, watching</p><p>the shore. He began to talk to the woman, </p><p>using strange words which meant nothing </p><p>to me, but which she evidently understood, </p><p>for she responded at once. Now I saw why </p><p>he had spent so much time with the man </p><p>from the west who knew Indian languages. </p><p>He had been learning how to speak the </p><p>savage dialect himself.</p><p> She laughed, that woman, and chattered</p><p>eagerly to Pedro and waved to us to come </p><p>to her. But that we did not do. Pedro </p><p>shook his head, and once he pointed up- </p><p>stream and said more things. </p><p> After a time he began to paddle again</p><p>and went 011 down the river and left her </p><p>behind. We passed around a bend and </p><p>then another, and when we were well out </p><p>of sight, he turned the canoe toward the </p><p>shore—across the river from the bank where </p><p>the woman had stood. At a good place we </p><p>landed, and there he arranged our cargo </p><p>again to suit himself. He laughed at all </p><p>my questions and made no answer, but his </p><p>130 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>eves sparkled, and his face was alive with </p><p>his thoughts, though at times he looked </p><p>a little puzzled and doubtful, too. </p><p> When he was ready we went back up-</p><p>stream. This time he gave no call, and </p><p>we paddled steadily until we reached that </p><p>place where first we had seen the woman. </p><p>There he turned toward the little creek, </p><p>and as we neared it I saw her again. Pedro </p><p>had made tryst with her and now he </p><p>stepped out on land and went boldly to her. </p><p>I stayed in the canoe. </p><p> “I think there is no danger here, Lou-</p><p>rengo,” he said, “but be alert.” </p><p> He talked more with her while I watched</p><p>them and everything around them. As </p><p>before, she chattered and laughed with him, </p><p>and I could see that she admired him much, </p><p>which was not strange, for men admired </p><p>him too—he was so tall and straight and </p><p>strong. </p><p> I saw also that he was questioning her,</p><p>and that she was not answering all his </p><p>questions. Once she wanted to look at </p><p>the stuff in our boat, but I warned her off, </p><p>and Pedro himself held her arm and stopped </p><p>her. </p><p> Finally he stepped back into the canoe,</p><p>and we went on up-river until we were </p><p>out of sight. There we picked a place </p><p>to camp and stayed there that night, </p><p>lighting no fire. </p><p> Before we slept, he told me that the</p><p>woman was living in the jungle with a man, </p><p>but what sort of a man he was or where </p><p>he lived she would not tell him. This man, </p><p>she said, was away somewhere that day, </p><p>and what he was doing she did not know. </p><p>When Pedro asked her if she would lead </p><p>us to the man’s camp she refused. Then </p><p>she asked what we had in our boat, and </p><p>he told her they were supplies for a new </p><p>camp. It was then that she tried to look </p><p>at them and we prevented her. After that </p><p>she asked where this new camp was, and </p><p>he told her at a certain place well up the </p><p>river, where there really was no camp and </p><p>where none was intended. In leaving her, </p><p>he told her he would not work the next day</p><p>because it was his birthday, and he would </p><p>come to meet her again at the same place. </p><p> “I ask you again, Pedro,” I said, “what</p><p>is the meaning of all this? And why are </p><p>you so interested in this savage woman?” </p><p> “Louren$o.” he answered, “we are now</p><p>not very far from headquarters. All of </p><p>our five friends whom the Death has struck </p><p>have disappeared not far from headquar- </p><p>ters—or so I believe. The place where we </p><p>first saw that woman is not far from head- </p><p>quarters. The place where she answered </p><p>my call today is still nearer to headquarters. </p><p>More than that, she answered from a spot </p><p>very near where Antonio Maciel vanished. </p><p>Now there is a riddle for you to puzzle over. </p><p>I am.going to sleep.” </p><p>IN THE morning we took out all </p><p>our bait and put it into the bush. </p><p>Pedro sat a while and watched the </p><p>creeping shadows, and, when it was time, </p><p>we went down the river again. As we </p><p>paddled along I said: </p><p> “Pedro, if this woman has anything to</p><p>do with the Death, as you believe, then </p><p>we are fools to meet her again where you </p><p>agreed, for we are likely to go into a trap </p><p>and never come out.” </p><p> He laughed and replied—</p><p> “If the Death is what I think it is, it is</p><p>now up the river seeking that new camp </p><p>of which I told her, and so it can do us </p><p>no harm.” </p><p> He seemed to be right, for the woman</p><p>awaited us, and they talked again for some </p><p>time, and nothing at all happened. I could </p><p>see that she was very much taken with my </p><p>handsome companion, but, as before, he </p><p>could not make her answer all his questions. </p><p>After we left her he said: </p><p> “She is no fool, Lourengo, for all that</p><p>she seems so simple. Still, I think that in </p><p>the end we shall learn what we want to </p><p>know.” </p><p> When I suggested that we hasten matters</p><p>by going straight to the place where she </p><p>had answered his bird-cry and searching the </p><p>jungle there, he snorted and replied:</p><p> “Oh, yes, surely. That was just what</p><p>Antonio was doing—searching the bush at </p><p>that place. And there were more men in </p><p>his party than in ours. Have patience, </p><p>comrade, and do not jump in the dark.” </p><p>This silenced me. </p><p> We hid for the rest of that day and that</p><p>night, and then we went to meet her again— </p><p>for the last time, as it turned out. She </p><p>seemed sulky, and when he tried to put </p><p>her in better humor she answered crossly, </p><p>and we saw that something had happened </p><p>since we left her. Yet Pedro finally coaxed </p><p>her into a cheery mood and she began to </p><p>smile and give him soft looks. </p><p> Later I learned that she had blurted out</p><p>The Spider </p><p>that he was lying to her because there was </p><p>no camp where lie had said. Of course, </p><p>that instantly showed him that his shrewd </p><p>guess had been right, and that she or her </p><p>man had sought that camp. He was not </p><p>foolish enough to let her see his thought, </p><p>however, and he told her that the plans </p><p>had been changed and the new camp was </p><p>being made at another place. After that </p><p>they talked on for some time, and he told </p><p>her how handsome she was and so on. </p><p> I was crouched in the canoe, as usual,</p><p>watching everything like a cat, and listening. </p><p>All at once my ear caught a tiny sound in </p><p>the bush—a soft rustle as if something </p><p>had brushed stealthily against some leaves. </p><p>Pedro and the woman were talking low, </p><p>and I put all my attention on that little </p><p>sound. It might be only a wandering </p><p>breeze, a crawling snake or some other </p><p>natural thing, but I had to be sure. Soon </p><p>I heard it again, very soft, and I knew </p><p>something was creeping nearer to us. </p><p>Then, at a place where the tangle was very </p><p>thick, I saw a slight movement caused by </p><p>something about the height of a man. </p><p> “Take care, Pedro!” I shouted.</p><p> Like a flash he dodged and leaped forward,</p><p>landing several feet away. Like a flash an </p><p>arrow sped through the place where he had </p><p>been. I threw up my rifle and fired </p><p>straight at the spot where I had seen the </p><p>movement; but even as my finger pressed </p><p>the trigger I knew the bullet had missed, </p><p>for a violent shaking of leaves showed that </p><p>the man there had thrown himself sidewise. </p><p>Then, while I was throwing another cart- </p><p>ridge into the barrel, the killing of that </p><p>man was taken out of my hands. </p><p> The woman sprang at the bush. In</p><p>one hand she held Pedro’s machetc, which </p><p>she had snatched from his belt. With that </p><p>weapon she hacked and stabbed in a furv </p><p>that was terrible to see. I caught glimpses </p><p>of a body writhing under her and heard a </p><p>snarl, a broken scream and a groan. Then </p><p>the body lay still and we heard no sound but </p><p>the slash of the long knife through the leaves </p><p>as the woman struck and struck and struck. </p><p> For a moment Pedro and I were para-</p><p>lyzed. Then Pedro seized her and twisted </p><p>the dripping machete from her hand. I</p><p>jumped ashore, and while she stood shaking </p><p>and sobbing with rage we dragged the body </p><p>out and looked at it. </p><p> “For Deus!” muttered Pedro. “The</p><p>Spider!” </p><p>YES, senhores, it was the Spider. </p><p>He was a frightful thing to look at, </p><p>but he was the Spider—the man </p><p>whom we had thought dead and who now </p><p>truly was so. Even in death he looked </p><p>the Spider, for his arms and legs were </p><p>crumpled up as if something had smashed </p><p>him. From his belt hung a narrow bag </p><p>made from a skin, ami in it were several </p><p>arrows. Stepping into the place where </p><p>his woman had killed him, we found his </p><p>bow—a short, clumsy but powerful weapon </p><p>that could drive an arrow clear through a </p><p>man at close range. </p><p> While we were looking at this we heard a</p><p>dragging sound and stepped out in time to </p><p>see the last of the Spider. With one hand </p><p>the woman was hauling him to the river. </p><p>There she picked him up as if he were only </p><p>a monkey, swung him and threw him out </p><p>into the water. </p><p> He struck and sank with a soggy splash.</p><p>A moment later the water began to seethe </p><p>and boil. We knew the piranhas, those </p><p>ravenous cannibal fish, were swarming </p><p>upon him and chopping him into frag- </p><p>ments. So thick were they that some of </p><p>them were crowded up into the air, snapping </p><p>their jaws like traps. A red stain grew on </p><p>the surface and slowly drifted down the </p><p>current with that hellish boiling going on </p><p>under it. Before long, though, the water </p><p>grew quiet again, and the red stain floated </p><p>out of sight. </p><p> Then the woman looked at Pedro. The</p><p>hatred faded out of her face, her fierce </p><p>eyes softened and she took his hand and </p><p>led us away into the jungle. We traveled </p><p>for some distance and stopped at length </p><p>in a place where Pedro looked about and </p><p>said— </p><p> “This is where Antonio disappeared.”</p><p> We could not see anything strange,</p><p>though at one spot the tangle of vines </p><p>and bush was very thick and matted to- </p><p>gether, as it may be anywhere in those</p><p>forests. The woman saw we were puzzled </p><p>and she walked up to that tangle—and sud- </p><p>denly she was gone. But she called, and </p><p>we followed her. And as we reached the </p><p>matted vines a part of them moved out- </p><p>ward like a door, and there she was, laugh- </p><p>ing like a little girl playing a game. </p><p> Senhores, that was the Spider’s nest—a</p><p>lair made from the growing bushes and vines </p><p>so cunningly twisted and woven among </p><p>themselves that a man could stand within </p><p>132 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>ten feet of it and never suspect that it was </p><p>a shelter and hiding-place. If ever there </p><p>was a great trap-door spider’s nest, that </p><p>was it. </p><p> The man Schwartz had followed the trap-</p><p>door spider’s example inside his den, as </p><p>well as outside. That spider, as you prob- </p><p>ably know, not only makes a door which </p><p>swings shut behind him, and covers that </p><p>door with things that grow around it, but </p><p>he also makes a secrct pocket at the side of </p><p>his nest, where he can hide if any enemy </p><p>discovers his lair. And the Spider had </p><p>done this also. </p><p> At one side of his den the ground rose,</p><p>and there he had dug a hole and covered it </p><p>over with the growing things so that </p><p>nobody would ever know it was there. It </p><p>was not meant to hide in, though, but to </p><p>conceal the things he took from murdered </p><p>men. In that hole, when the woman </p><p>showed it to us, we found all the property </p><p>of Custodio, Gumercindo, Saldanha and </p><p>the brothers Maciel. There was Gumer- </p><p>cindo’s money, the supplies taken from the </p><p>others and their weapons and even their </p><p>clothes. But of the men themselves there </p><p>was no sign anywhere. </p><p> When Pedro asked the woman what had</p><p>become of the men, she said that after the </p><p>Spider killed them and stripped them of all </p><p>they had, he did with them just what she </p><p>had finally done to him—threw them to </p><p>the piranhas, which quickly destroyed </p><p>them. </p><p> Their canoes, she said, he hid until</p><p>night, when he took them far up the quiet </p><p>little creek where we had first seen her, and </p><p>there, where neither flame nor smoke </p><p>would be seen by any one, he burned them— </p><p>all except the light, fast canoe of Custodio, </p><p>which he concealed very cunningly and </p><p>used himself. In this he made his spying </p><p>trips, going at night and staying away for </p><p>a day or two. No doubt he had been al- </p><p>most beside us more than once, lying low, </p><p>watching and listening with that spidery </p><p>patience of his and learning whom he </p><p>might kill with profit. </p><p> In all these murders, the woman said, he</p><p>used the bow and arrow which was silent </p><p>and easy enough to handle at close range. </p><p>In all the killings except that of Antonio </p><p>Maciel he made her lure the men ashore at </p><p>some place where he lurked, ready to </p><p>strike them down. To Custodio, Lucas </p><p>and Saldanha she had called and showed </p><p>herself, just as she did to us, and they came </p><p>to her and so to their death. Gumercindo </p><p>was caught in another way, for he was a </p><p>shrewd man and was hastening home and </p><p>thus was not so likely to tarry for any </p><p>savage woman. The Spider had had her </p><p>stay out of sight, though near the water, </p><p>and scream as if in great danger. Gum- </p><p>ercindo, like a brave fellow he was, sped to </p><p>shore and dashed into the bush to save the </p><p>one who was in such distress. He was </p><p>shot in the back for his pains. </p><p> Antonio Maciel was killed because he was</p><p>coming straight at the Spider’s nest with his </p><p>machete ready to cut through what he took </p><p>for a natural tangle. Through a small </p><p>opening in the side of his den the Spider </p><p>shot him and dragged him swiftly inside, so </p><p>that when the other men arrived they found </p><p>nothing but the last place where he had cut </p><p>his way. That was some distance back </p><p>from where he died. </p><p> We learned, too, that Pedro and I were</p><p>to have been the next victims, if we had </p><p>come near enough. The Spider had a </p><p>place down-stream where he could watch </p><p>what went on at headquarters across the </p><p>river, and he saw Pedro load up the canoe </p><p>with what looked like many supplies, and so </p><p>hastened back and made the woman run to </p><p>that place at the creek and play her part </p><p>when we passed on our return. While she </p><p>tried to bring us ashore he lurked ready </p><p>to kill us, but when we refused to come </p><p>he was too wise to attack us at a distance, </p><p>so he let us go. </p><p> So Pedro’s foolish bait caught some-</p><p>thing after all, though even he did not sus- </p><p>pect that the Spider still lived. He carried </p><p>that bait to see what might come of it and </p><p>later he believed that the Death was some </p><p>Indian. </p><p> When we came back and Pedro had</p><p>given the bird-call of her people, she was </p><p>alone, for the Spider was away somewhere </p><p>spying, and she wanted us to come ashore</p><p>only because she was hungry to talk with </p><p>the man who could speak her own tongue. </p><p> After she left us at the creek she told</p><p>the Spider, on his return, of our new camp </p><p>and all our new supplies. He went seeking </p><p>it, came back angry and beat her. From </p><p>that time on she told him nothing more of </p><p>us but met Pedro secretly. She did not </p><p>know that the Spider had followed her on </p><p>that last day until Pedro jumped, and the </p><p>arrow flashed by him. Then her hatred </p><p>Big Medicine </p><p>133 </p><p>of the Spider, which had long been growing </p><p>in her, flamed out in the fury that destroyed </p><p>him. </p><p> She had no love for him, but had been</p><p>sold to him by her people, whom he had </p><p>met by chance in the jungle before he came </p><p>back to the river and made his lair. He </p><p>gave the headman his rifle for her, she said, </p><p>and, though he had used up all his cartridges </p><p>so that the gun was useless, the headman </p><p>made the trade because women were plenti- </p><p>ful in his tribe but guns were very scarce, </p><p>and he might be able to get cartridge. </p><p> She told us also that her people knew</p><p>where there was gold, and that the Spider </p><p>had planned to get much of this gold in </p><p>trade for the supplies he took from our men. </p><p>Thus, in time, he hoped to become very </p><p>rich,'and then, perhaps, would make his </p><p>way into Peru, where he was not known, </p><p>and where he icould enjoy the wealth </p><p>gained through the deaths of honest men. </p><p> So you see, senhores, it was as I told you</p><p>at the beginning—this man lived like a </p><p>spider and he died like one. If you know </p><p>spiders, you know that the female is larger </p><p>and stronger than the male, and that often </p><p>she turns 011 him and destroys him. The </p><p>thing that destroyed this Spider was the </p><p>fact that he did not know this big, hand- </p><p>some woman’s heart. </p><p> Though I do not claim to know much of</p><p>women, yet I have observed a few and I </p><p>have noticed that when a man treats a </p><p>woman as something bought and paid for, </p><p>the time may come when lie had best be- </p><p>ware of her. I have noticed, loo, that when </p><p>women meet men for whom they care, it </p><p>makes little difference whether they are </p><p>fine ladies from Rio, or humble maidens of </p><p>the village, or savage women of the jungle— </p><p>at heart they are all the same. </p><p>Author oj “The No-Good Guy,” "The Streak of Lean,” etc. </p><p>BIQ </p><p> MEDICINE</p><p> gr</p><p>EdgarYoung </p><p>TOM FLOOD was the windiest </p><p>man in Gatun. He hadn’t hit </p><p>town but a few days when some </p><p>one allowed that he “sure was </p><p>‘big medicine’ to hear him tell it.” “Ala- </p><p>bam” Goodloe, who hailed from Kentucky </p><p>and talked like a coon, bet a five-dollar gold </p><p>piece on Flood’s “come-out” that night in a </p><p>crap game down in House 68 on the New </p><p>Gatun road. </p><p> Flood threw the double six, the double</p><p>ace and the ace deuce the first three shots, </p><p>which, in the natural consequence of tilings, </p><p>cost Alabam thirty-five dollars, for he was </p><p>doubling his bet each time. He then bet </p><p>forty and Flood threw the double deuce, </p><p>little Joe, for a point. The crowd laughed </p><p>at this mess of “slow craps,” for there are </p><p>more sevens on a pair of bones than there </p><p>are fours, O my brothers. </p><p> Goodloe passed the dice back to Flood</p><p>with anything but hope written in his face, </p><p>and, as Flood shook diem and pounded </p><p>them against his head for luck, Alabam, in </p><p>that pleading tone peculiar to a “nachel </p><p>bohn” crap-shooter, had called on him as </p><p>follows: </p><p> “Looky hyeah, Big Medicine, you bettah</p><p>had make that ah-uh joah! Shake, rattle </p><p>and roll ’em way out!” Sundry other re- </p><p>marks followed in crap-shooter jargon. </p><p> The faders shouted with laughter. Some</p><p>134 </p><p>Adventure^ </p><p>looked quickly for signs of anger in Flood’s </p><p>face at the nickname Goodloe had called </p><p>him, for men sometimes do not take kindly </p><p>to construction-camp appellations, which </p><p>are usually epithetic in character and have </p><p>to do with outstanding personal and physi- </p><p>cal traits. At that time, we had in Gatun </p><p>a “Step-and-a-half,” a “Three Fingers,” </p><p>big and little “Baldy,” “Gimpy,” “Slim,” </p><p>“Shorty,” and many a “Tex" and “Red,” </p><p>with a descriptive adjective preceding, and </p><p>a “Cowboy Lawyer” from Tucson. </p><p> Flood, however, caught the joke and</p><p>laughed louder than the others, and in a </p><p>few days every man in camp knew him as </p><p>Big Medicine. Many people on the Zone </p><p>never knew what his real name was. </p><p> If a name ever fitted a man this name</p><p>fitted Flood. He was big in every way </p><p>—six foot three inches of awkwarkness, </p><p>big hands, big feet, and the double joints </p><p>on his knees and wrists stuck out like </p><p>knobs. His face was a brick red and his </p><p>thin hair and eyebrows were white as cot- </p><p>ton, not from old age but from being born </p><p>that way, for he was nearer thirty-five than </p><p>forty. His mouth was wide and filled </p><p>with short, heavy teeth. His eyes were a </p><p>china blue and stared as frankly as those </p><p>of a doll’s in a “Kentucky Derby” flimflam </p><p>stand at Coney Island. </p><p> He looked outlandish in commissary</p><p>khakis. Zone fashions for men ran to stiff </p><p>brimmed Stetsons of the same type worn </p><p>by the Zone police, and pigskin puttees. </p><p>Flood retained his big, round-topped, west </p><p>Texas hat with flopping brim, and a pair </p><p>of Mexican leggings that snapped on the </p><p>side with a steel spring and fastened under- </p><p>neath the instep with a buckle and strap; </p><p>they extended above his knees in the shape </p><p>of a semicircle. When he carried his jacket </p><p>on his arm his heavy suspenders caught and </p><p>held the eye, for men wore belts on the </p><p>Zone. </p><p> And talk? This was the biggest part</p><p>about him. His voice was loud and his </p><p>laugh a guffaw. His words boomed up and </p><p>down the streets and through the flimsy </p><p>bachelor quarters, which were unceiled </p><p>buildings with partitions running part way</p><p>and lattice-work the rest of the way be- </p><p>tween the rooms. When he was in one of </p><p>these buildings his laugh could be heard in </p><p>all the others in that area. </p><p> On the four days following the monthly</p><p>tour of the pay-wagon with its yellow money </p><p>for white men and white money for yellow </p><p>and black men, the coin of two realms itched </p><p>like cooties in men’s clothes. Those of the </p><p>“gold roll” whose inclinations were toward </p><p>games of chance listened for Big Medicine’s </p><p>laugh and drifted in for a game of poker or </p><p>to shout incantations to the ivory cubes. </p><p>And when we were broke, on the other </p><p>twenty-six days of the month, we looked for </p><p>a crowd on a porch of one of the quarters </p><p>and went there to hear Big Medicine shoot </p><p>the bull. </p><p> He had been everywhere. He was born1</p><p>in a covered wagon somewhwere out in the </p><p>Panhandle, and as far back as he could re- </p><p>member his “old man” and “old lady” had </p><p>been among the first to put out in the direc- </p><p>tion of any rumored gold strike, land boom, </p><p>or other frontier rainbow’s end. When </p><p>finally they had settled on the rockiest and </p><p>sandiest patch of land in the Mormon </p><p>Valley of Idaho, he, with his natural heri- </p><p>tage of gipsy blood, had set forth to ap- </p><p>pease his wanderlust in many lands. He </p><p>had broken horses and roped steers from </p><p>Alberta to Chihuahua, been a railroad </p><p>“shack,” miner, stage-coach driver, lumber- </p><p>jack, harvest hand, trapper, hunter, Swiss </p><p>guide, Quaker medicine man, sailor before </p><p>the mast, tropical prospector and tramp, </p><p>and explorer in both arctic and antarctic </p><p>expeditions. </p><p> He made his advent on the Zone by walk-</p><p>ing through from Acaponeta, Mexico, </p><p>“stepping out,” as he expressed it, “after a </p><p>fashion fast and furious.” Those of us </p><p>who had made the same walk listened with </p><p>more than casual interest and quizzed him </p><p>on the landmarks. He knew the little </p><p>turn, the big banyan tree, the deserted </p><p>fisherman’s hut, the broken adze, the grass </p><p>village; he could not have bluffed. Other </p><p>men made shrewd inquiries at the psycho- </p><p>logical moment, for the Panama Canal </p><p>Zone was a good place to get caught “out </p><p>on a limb.” Men who worked there had </p><p>been in every nook and corner of the globe. </p><p>It was something like the Snug Harbor</p><p>Home for sailors on Staten Island, where old </p><p>men between seventy and ninety can tell </p><p>you the exact telegraph pole and window- </p><p>pane in that little obscure port you spoke </p><p>about. </p><p> Many of us knew that Flood’s yarns were</p><p>consistent. He embellished the truth, he </p><p>handled it carelessly, he stretched it out </p><p>almost to the breaking point, he tossed it </p><p>Big Medicine </p><p>135 </p><p>up and caught it precariously with one </p><p>hand behind his back, but he was never </p><p>trapped in a bare-faced lie. He was a </p><p>master at enlarging an incident until men </p><p>held their sides and roared with him, or </p><p>stood with gaping mouths as he related </p><p>just when, where and how he had been </p><p>mixed up in some dramatic occurrence. </p><p>He laughed heartily at his funny sallies </p><p>and was the big hero in most of the others. </p><p>BIG MEDICINE was some sort of </p><p>a general foreman down on the rock </p><p>storage dump back of New Gatun— </p><p>a settlement of saloons, negro tenements, </p><p>“silver roll” men with families who did not </p><p>care to live in the Government labor bar- </p><p>racks, and camp followers who did not work </p><p>for the I. C. C. He had several native </p><p>straw bosses with gangs of Spaniards and </p><p>West Indian blacks working for him and </p><p>three American locomotive crane-runners. </p><p>The rock trains dumped the stone at the </p><p>top and the large chunks either rolled down </p><p>at once or were pried loose and started </p><p>down by the gangs. At the bottom they </p><p>were picked up and reloaded into skips, </p><p>placed on cars and taken to the locks and </p><p>dumped in with the concrete. Orange- </p><p>peel buckets or chains were used by the </p><p>craneman. </p><p> Each day’s work and the trip down and</p><p>back through New Gatun supplied Flood </p><p>with material for hours of yam spinning on </p><p>the piazza in the cool of the evening—or at </p><p>least when the evening should have been </p><p>cool but usually wasn’t. He had heard a </p><p>negro wench talking to a sanitary inspector </p><p>in patois English; seen two naked kids </p><p>fighting; one of the crane-runners had re- </p><p>fused a bottle of beer from the water cooler </p><p>in Flood’s office, and he had phoned for the </p><p>ambulance; a Bajan had delivered a sermon </p><p>to a group of others behind the tool house; </p><p>he had sent three Castilians for a box of </p><p>dynamite and had had to go after them; a </p><p>Gallego had made a funny remark in un- </p><p>grammatical Spanish—anything. It was </p><p>all grist for his story-telling proclivity. </p><p> He had little education, reading and</p><p>writing with difficulty, but he had a flow of </p><p>picturesque language that was at once </p><p>gripping and startling. He brought to the</p><p>Zone expressions that remained for months </p><p>after he had gone, such as: “Shoot where </p><p>he’s standing without giving him time to </p><p>jump up;” “claw him from his forehead to </p><p>his umbilicus;” “tear him up as if the hogs </p><p>had chawed him;” “pull his eyeball out a </p><p>foot and flop it back into place and scare </p><p>him;” “re-Jake and back at you again with </p><p>my stack of yallers,” “just barely,” and the </p><p>like. </p><p> And these, dead as they look in cold</p><p>print, were replete with meaning in the </p><p>mouth of this big, red faced, white eye- </p><p>browed man. lie could mimic a Swede, </p><p>any type of lime-juicer from a remittance </p><p>man to a Liverpool Gorblimme-Bill, a </p><p>Western judge, any type of Spaniard, and </p><p>almost any other kind of man he had laid </p><p>eyes on. North “Caroleenians” he dubbed </p><p>“down-homers,” explaining that they all </p><p>went to Virginia and spent the rest of their </p><p>lives talking about “down home.” East </p><p>Texans were “boll-weevils” and “rawzum- </p><p>bellies” and they raised “lean do-gie” </p><p>cattle, whatever kind of cattle that is. </p><p> Life was one big joke shot through with</p><p>dramatic incidents, down on the porch of </p><p>House 68. No man went inside and went to </p><p>bed until Flood did—it wasn’t any use. </p><p>That’s how windy he was. Men sometimes </p><p>passed the wink when he was spinning his </p><p>fighting yarns, and a good one hundred per </p><p>cent, said to each other behind his back that </p><p>they did not think he would harm a fly; that </p><p>he just liked to talk, and no one had ever </p><p>seen him sore for so much as a second. It </p><p>was out of reason that a man as good- </p><p>natured as he was should ever have had </p><p>trouble with any man. </p><p> And then a man moved into House 68</p><p>who did not seem to take kindly to him. </p><p>He also had drifted in over the trail from </p><p>somewhwere or other, he didn’t say just </p><p>where, and had been running a stiff-leg </p><p>derrick down at Mindi and had been trans- </p><p>ferred to one of the cranes on Flood’s rock </p><p>storage dump. He and Flood had showed </p><p>up walking together the first evening he </p><p>appeared at House 68 and that night he had' </p><p>been one of the cirtle gathered around Big </p><p>Medicine. After that they did not show up </p><p>together, and when the group gathered, this </p><p>newcomer sat far at the other end by him- </p><p>self. We took it for granted that Flood</p><p>had given him a call on the job and that he </p><p>was peeved about it. </p><p> He was as big a man as Flood, but of a</p><p>different type. He was tall and rangy, </p><p>swarthy of complexion, with a small, waxy, </p><p>black mustache, quiet as a grave, dangerous </p><p>as a machine-gun, boasting of his prowess as </p><p>136 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>a fighter by his silence more than Flood did </p><p>by his words. He passed no wink but he </p><p>often turned and listened gravely with a </p><p>half sneer on his lips when Flood made some </p><p>particularly bald assertion in regard to some </p><p>fight or other, and it seemed that fighting </p><p>had become the theme of the majority of </p><p>Big Medicine’s tales with himself the fight- </p><p>ing son of a gun from way back. </p><p> Those who saw he doubted Flood’s</p><p>stories had little use for him. They, them- </p><p>selves, looked on them as things to be taken </p><p>with a sprinkling of bichloride of sodium in </p><p>spots; but he was a good entertainer. He </p><p>was a sort of vaudeville performer, and no </p><p>one expected the exact truth to the letter. </p><p>No man ever went to a picture show in the </p><p>Y. M. C. A. while Flood lived in House 68. </p><p> Flood wasn’t afraid of this newcomer’s</p><p>opinion, or didn’t appear to be. He would </p><p>tell some outlandish story of fighting and </p><p>gun-play where he was the big It and then </p><p>he would rear back in his chair and peer </p><p>through the bunch to see how the crane- </p><p>man took it. He told us in a loud aside </p><p>that the stranger was “Nig” Barberly, an </p><p>ex-tinhorn from Salina Cruz, and that he </p><p>was “pizen and meaner’n a kyotie.” </p><p> Further, he said little in answer to whis-</p><p>pered queries other than that they had never </p><p>been good friends and had had words on the </p><p>job over the work, and that some day he </p><p>reckoned he would empty a gun into Nig’s </p><p>carcass so fast it would “cut him right off </p><p>at the top of the pockets.” </p><p> Barberly heard this and walked into his</p><p>room, soon to return with a bristling </p><p>cartridge-belt buckled around him. Every </p><p>man in the crowd noticed this, but Flood </p><p>was in the midst of a yarn that required all </p><p>his attention when Barberly reappeared. </p><p> From this time on we noticed that the ill</p><p>feeling seemed to grow more pronounced </p><p>on both sides, Flood raising his voice many </p><p>times for Barberly’s particular benefit, </p><p>Barberly growing more silent and sneering </p><p>in his solitary chair at the other end of the </p><p>porch. </p><p> These porches, by the way, were four</p><p>rooms long and were heavily screened with </p><p>bronze mosquito-wire. The screen door </p><p>was just opposite the door to the house in </p><p>the center—information little required by </p><p>men who know Gatun and the road that </p><p>wound around the top of the hill to New </p><p>Gatun. As a rule Flood’s end of the piazza </p><p>was crowded with men who either lived in </p><p>House 68, or neighboring quarters, or paused </p><p>on their pilgrimage to New Gatun and re- </p><p>mained to get an ear-full. </p><p>ONE evening after supper we fore- </p><p>gathered as usual. It was during </p><p>the dry season and the red sun hung </p><p>poised a few feet over the Caribbean down </p><p>beyond Colon, for the sun sets in the At- </p><p>lantic from the C. Z. It was hot and some </p><p>men lolled in pajamas and some in gaudy </p><p>silk kimonos they had won in Chinese raffles. </p><p>Flood had pulled his leggings and shoes off </p><p>and sat in his shirt sleeves with his heavy </p><p>braces thrown down from his shoulders. </p><p> Hotter than the setting sun were his</p><p>yarns of battles on blackbirders down in </p><p>the South Seas when he was the bosom pal </p><p>of old Cap. Durfee. Blood flowed, snarling </p><p>lipped men sprang upon each other and </p><p>beat and mauled and slashed to a fare-ye- </p><p>well. Desert sands glowed white under the </p><p>boiling sun, and along trails dotted with </p><p>human skulls daring men ventured, with </p><p>Flood usually in the lead; bands of swash- </p><p>buckling revolutionists attacked and </p><p>smashed the enemy, fighting valiantly and </p><p>sapping their way through intervening </p><p>buildings. </p><p> Through mad stampedes in the far North</p><p>we surged, flogging the lagging huskies with </p><p>the singing whips. Sheath knives gleamed </p><p>greasily in the murky light cast by swinging </p><p>forecastle lamps as with a table leg we </p><p>met the onrush of pockmarked Portuguese </p><p>sailors. We shivered and munched gum </p><p>drops and ate dried pemmican at the two </p><p>poles of the earth. The ice groaned and </p><p>upheaved beneath us, and outside our </p><p>igloos of snow the wolf dogs howled mourn- </p><p>fully. </p><p> Flood painted with a lavish brush. But</p><p>colder than the arctic or ’antarctic wastes </p><p>sat Nig Barberly at the other end of the </p><p>porch, swarthy faced, silent and sneering. </p><p> At the conclusion of one of Flood’s nar-</p><p>ratives he took his feet down from the rail- </p><p>ing, cleared his throat, spat through the </p><p>screening and turned his chair half around </p><p>in our direction. He expelled the air from </p><p>his lungs in a contemptuous grunt. </p><p> Flood reared up and looked across at him</p><p>for a few seconds like an angry lion. Then </p><p>he began telling about beating up a certain </p><p>individual in Salina Cruz. He took great </p><p>pains on the personal description of this </p><p>individual, painting him as a tall, lanky </p><p>Big Medicine </p><p>137 </p><p>man, black-mustached, silent to surliness, </p><p>underhanded, mean, low-down, and very </p><p>dangerous in the cunning way of a snake in </p><p>dog days. His description fitted Barberly </p><p>so well that most of us were dividing our </p><p>attention between the story and watching </p><p>how Nig would take it. </p><p> Flood elaborated. He had just ended a</p><p>sentence about said party in question being </p><p>so "honery” that he would “beat up his own </p><p>granny” and “take up sprouted corn” when </p><p>we noticed Barberly’s face contort into lines </p><p>of horrible ferocity. His white teeth </p><p>gleamed through his snarling lips. A </p><p>volley of oaths roared from his lungs as he </p><p>cursed Flood for every liar and so-and-so </p><p>imaginable. </p><p> big Medicine sprang three feet in the air</p><p>and went for him all spraddled out, whoop- </p><p>ing like an Indian. Barberly whipped out </p><p>two .45 Colts and began shooting from both </p><p>hips. </p><p> Alabam Goodloe always denied being</p><p>the first to jump through the screen, for </p><p>it was torn off the entire end of the porch </p><p>by the swarming crowd. Some ran up the </p><p>road toward the eating-house and some ran </p><p>down the road toward New Gatun and some </p><p>ran around and watched proceedings, their </p><p>morbid curiosity to see bloodshed and </p><p>slaughter getting the better of their judg- </p><p>ment. </p><p> I was one of these latter and when I got</p><p>out in the road Flood was writhing on the </p><p>door in horrible fashion and groaning like a </p><p>stricken bull. He struggled to his knees </p><p>and from the recesses of his shirt and pants </p><p>drew forth a sawed-off shotgun with the </p><p>stock whittled into a pistol handle—the </p><p>most ghastly shooting-iron that any man </p><p>ever laid eyes on. When both barrels </p><p>went off it sounded like the premature blast </p><p>in Culebra Cut the time Teddy was </p><p>down. </p><p> I was nearing the hospital on the hill be-</p><p>tween there and New Gatun when 1 heard </p><p>live feeble little shots like a pop-gun from </p><p>back in that direction, but I didn’t turn to </p><p>look back. I was on my way for the ambu- </p><p>lance and in my heartfelt desire to get help</p><p>as soon as possible had forgotten that there </p><p>was a phone in the hook and ladder house a </p><p>few doors above House 68. Had I remem- </p><p>bered, it is doubtful whether I would have </p><p>tried to use the phone, for the girls were </p><p>very popular and connections hard to get </p><p>after the men had left off work on the job. </p><p>A FEW evenings later, when Flood </p><p>narrated the incident to an unusu- </p><p>ally large bunch on the porch, he </p><p>gave what I hadn’t seen as follows: </p><p> “Me and Nig both fell sprawlin’ and the</p><p>few that hadn’t yet joined the bird gang </p><p>showed signs of speed and tore up the </p><p>ground getting away. Them big poky dot </p><p>suits bellied out behind and them red </p><p>shimmies stuck back like table tops. I </p><p>hyeard women screaming as they passed </p><p>them four-family houses above the eatin’ </p><p>house. I peers down the road and they’s a </p><p>motley crew of them hittin’ the high spots in </p><p>that direction with Sandy working in the </p><p>lead in a suit of B. V. D.’s turning sideways </p><p>to keep from flyin’. I look straight down, </p><p>below and see Slim and “Banjer-Pickin” </p><p>Charley tearin’ through the swag for the </p><p>Z. P. station, buckjumpin’ the high weeds </p><p>and ditches. </p><p> “This has all took place in a second and a</p><p>quarter and we’re yet holdin’ our mouths </p><p>with our hands to keep from squallin’ and </p><p>laughin’; and we’re faunching and wringing </p><p>and twisting all over the floor and makin’ </p><p>funny noises in our throats at the joke we’ve </p><p>sprung when Nig and I both glances up and </p><p>sees something that puts that supper </p><p>we’ve ate right against our epiglotis. </p><p> “They’s an arm poked out the winder,</p><p>weavin’ back and forth, and death, hell, </p><p>and the grave pintin’ in our general direc- </p><p>tion in the shape of a New York bull-dog </p><p>pistol with the barrel an inch and a six- </p><p>teenth long and the caliber of Ped’Migel </p><p>tunnel. Whoever he is ain’t lookin’ out </p><p>but squallin’ on his hunkers on the inside </p><p>and aimin’ to shoot l&gt;e-guess and be-god. </p><p>I reckon he knows his weapon, for them bull- </p><p>dogs spit and shave lead and kick and are </p><p>dangerous at all points of the compass when </p><p>they go off. </p><p> “As the hammer begins to raise, me and</p><p>Nig puts for the screen door on our all </p><p>fours, like a couple of bears before a Kansas</p><p>cyclone. Nig swears he straddled me and </p><p>rode me out the door. I remember dis- </p><p>tinctly that I thought he was that little </p><p>Six-Bits I jode for Lew Warren in Prickly </p><p>Pear Valley out near East Helena and I </p><p>skinned both heels spurring Nig’s cartridge- </p><p>belt. He buckjumped from the door to the </p><p>ground and I reached for leather but there </p><p>warn’t none and he throwed me. First </p><p>time I was ever throwed by man or beast, </p><p>and I’ve forked Catalo in my time and rode </p><p>138 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>steers in town fairs. We dove under the </p><p>house side by side. </p><p> “That old bull-pup says bowie up above</p><p>and they’s a chunk of lead as big and flat </p><p>as a dollar digs a gopher hole between our </p><p>heads, and they’s an aftermath of shavings </p><p>and sawdust pours down on us. Nig rolls </p><p>one way and me t’other and we hear three </p><p>more shoots shot and the balls a-tearin’ out </p><p>through the ceiling and the tin roof, and we </p><p>know the old short nose is performing true </p><p>to form. </p><p> “At the fourth shot, whoever had the gun</p><p>has throwed it from him, and it bounces out </p><p>the door into the road. Nig claims he seen </p><p>the hammer strike a rock, but from where I </p><p>lay the gun appeared to twirl around and </p><p>take due and deliberate aim at the upper </p><p>left-hand corner of my shirt pocket. I seen </p><p>the hammer raise, heard her click, and see </p><p>her go off. She jumped three feet and a </p><p>quarter in the air, and a Trinidad nigger in </p><p>my gang says it knocked the bean pot square </p><p>out of his female’s hand, just this side of </p><p>the reservoir. </p><p> “By the time we gels sealed on the steps</p><p>and i’ve taken out a deck of kyards. and </p><p>begin dealin’ us a friendly hand of seven up, </p><p>all of Gatun, New Gatun, half of Mindi, </p><p>and a quarter of Mount Hope is foggin’ in </p><p>our direction. I reckon it’s a good thing </p><p>that, although I’m a man of few words, I </p><p>can hand out a good single-handed line of </p><p>talk when I’m forced to. </p><p> “I staved off the ambulance men who was</p><p>for talcin’ us to the hospital, the Z. P. who </p><p>wanted to jug us, the sanitary inspector </p><p>who wanted to lick us for tearin’ the </p><p>screenin', the colonel and the major who </p><p>wanted to fire us, and our fellow house-mates </p><p>who wanted to kill us. It took seven </p><p>quarts of Sunnybrook before we declared </p><p>peace among ourselves and with the world </p><p>in general at midnight.” </p><p> Although I heard Big Medicine tell the</p><p>yarn a dozen times, adding various new </p><p>lights to it on each repetition, I never heard </p><p>him mention how we found “Sinbad the </p><p>Sailor,” a little hunchbacked New York </p><p>Jew named Sindeband, at a late hour</p><p>wedged in behind a clothes closet shivering </p><p>and crying with fright, thinking he’d shot </p><p>Nig Barberly in defending Flood from him. </p><p>Sinbad thought the world of Big Medicine </p><p>and many’s the tale Flood afterward spun </p><p>for his particular benefit. </p><p> Finally Big Medicine sprung the big sur-</p><p>prize when Jumbo, the blacksmith, got on a </p><p>rampage and climbed his frame down in </p><p>front of the eating-house. Men who saw it </p><p>claimed there never was such another fight </p><p>south of the Rio Grande River, for they </p><p>fought for an hour. Flood licked big </p><p>Jumbo to a standstill, and the two of them </p><p>went down into New Gatun to have a drink </p><p>together. There’s exceptions to all rules </p><p>and we had to acknowledge that Big </p><p>Medicine was one of them. </p><p>NIGHT ON THE DESERT </p><p> BY W. H.

Allan Dunn</p><p>Author of "Death's Carpenter," “The Pearls of Paruki," etc. </p><p>CHAPTER I </p><p>THROATS IN PERIL </p><p>THE puzzling, intermittent flashes </p><p>came again, distinctly, as Neill </p><p>McNeill, with his back to the </p><p>sun that was just lifting above </p><p>the horizon that rimmed the golden-brown </p><p>desert, gazed with a troubled forehead at </p><p>the spot where the phenomenon had ap- </p><p>peared. He did not like it, he told himself, </p><p>even while he strove to find some natural </p><p>explanation for the dazzling streaks that </p><p>came, irregularly enough, yet with a pre- </p><p>cision that hinted at some systematic </p><p>method of production, flickering like minia- </p><p>ture lightning from the low western hills </p><p>whence their little caravan had recently </p><p>emerged. </p><p> It might be caused, he thought, by the</p><p>level rays of the rising sun shot back from </p><p>the shoulder of a ledge heavily flaked with </p><p>mica, shifting from the various facets with </p><p>the changing angle of the golden beams, but </p><p>he had not noticed any indications of mica </p><p>in those sandstone hills and he was apt to </p><p>notice such things. It was his business as a </p><p>professional traveler and adventurer to do </p><p>so. </p><p> Another series of the Hashes started and</p><p>flickered out, and McNeill shook his head </p><p>slightly. </p><p> “I’m hanged if I like it,” he said just</p><p>above his breath. “Looks as if some one </p><p>were signaling in Morse, though if it were </p><p>Morse I could read it; it may be a Chinese </p><p>code at that. If so, who are they talking </p><p>to? There’s something fishy about this </p><p>hurried return trip. The old boy was in </p><p>too much of a hurry to get back to Peking </p><p>and—I wonder!” </p><p> His gaze wandered over the sleeping</p><p>camp. Two mangy camels, sulky even in </p><p>their sleep, lay with their heads stretched </p><p>out. on snaky necks. A dozen pack and </p><p>saddle horses, dwarfed and shaggy, stood</p><p>dejectedly about at the end of their </p><p>pickets. </p><p> By the side of his own dog-tent was the</p><p>humped canvas where Howard' Remsden </p><p>snored on one side of a primitive screen </p><p>while, on the other, his stepdaughter, </p><p>Helen, slumbered far more gracefully and </p><p>easily. Spoked out around the ashes of </p><p>last night’s fire sprawled half a dozen Mon- </p><p>gols. As McNeill looked keenly at these, </p><p>counting them, first one and then another </p><p>writhed and twisted in the sleep that was </p><p>already beginning to be disturbed by the </p><p>sun. There had been a long Irek the night </p><p>before, and man and beast had been ex- </p><p>hausted before the dry camp had been </p><p>pitched. </p><p> Suddenly McNeill gave vent to a short</p><p>exclamation and swiftly, silently passed over </p><p>the sand, soft and line as ashes, closer to the </p><p>lire and the sprawling Mongols. His Ups </p><p>parted in a smile as he peered closely at </p><p>the nearest figure—lifeless, a huddle of </p><p>clothes and dirty sheepskin. </p><p> “Neat trick that,” he told himself.</p><p>“Slipped out of his duds. Now then-” </p><p> His practised eyes easily picked up the</p><p>trail of sandal-prints that led from the </p><p>group, over low waves of sand that so </p><p>140 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>blended in the strong, level light as to give </p><p>a false suggestion of flatness. </p><p> His hand dropped to an automatic, bol-</p><p>stered at his right hip, as he swiftly crouched </p><p>to a kneeling position, one hand supporting </p><p>him, the other 011 the grip of his gun, while </p><p>he stretched his neck and looked over the </p><p>crest of a shady billow. </p><p> His dark blue eyes matched the hue of the</p><p>steel of the pistol, gleaming- through nar- </p><p>rowed lids at the almost naked figure that </p><p>squatted on the farther slope facing the </p><p>spot where the flashes had shown in the </p><p>hills. A brown, long-lingered hand clutched </p><p>a disc of polished silver lilted so as lo catch </p><p>the sun-rays flaring off at premeditated in- </p><p>tervals, a long or short glare of intense light </p><p>as the curving hand rocked back and forth </p><p>on the supple, sinewy wrist. </p><p> One flash caught McNeill fairly in the</p><p>eyes and made them water. He noiselessly </p><p>shifted his angle and then inched back, rose </p><p>upright, strode past the Mongols and dived </p><p>into his dog-tent from which he almost im- </p><p>mediately emerged and started to shout at </p><p>the sleeping men in their own dialect, with a </p><p>vigor that soon brought some semblance of </p><p>concerted action from them. A fire was </p><p>started and preparations made for the </p><p>morning meal. </p><p> The man who had been manipulating the</p><p>silver mirror appeared, yawning as he came </p><p>over the low dunes. He was of the northern </p><p>clans, a giant in stature, as tall as McNeill, </p><p>even broader-shouldered and with arms that </p><p>swung his hands close to the knee-caps. A </p><p>long knife, unsheathed, flashed red on his </p><p>thigh. He hailed McNeill with a morning </p><p>greeting, and the latter responded with jaws </p><p>that shut grimly after the Salutation. </p><p> “It’s the first time I ever saw them mir-</p><p>ror-talk in China,” Neill was thinking, “but </p><p>there’s no reason why they shouldn’t. </p><p>Lots of things I haven’t seen and never will. </p><p>And those priests-? </p><p> “We’ll start in fifteen minutes. Ling,” he</p><p>said to the tall headman. “We’ll drink tea </p><p>and eat after we get on the march.” </p><p> Ling’s mask of old ivory did not change,</p><p>but his voice was gently deprecatory. </p><p> “The master and his daughter are not</p><p>yet arisen!” he said. “The beasts are </p><p>tired.” </p><p> “That is my affair!” snapped McNeill.</p><p>“I am your master in this business and </p><p>you have your orders. See that you </p><p>obey!” </p><p> He could sense that the rest of the Mon-</p><p>gols had suddenly stiffened in their atti- </p><p>tudes, temporarily frozen, keen to some </p><p>tenseness in the situation and the whip- </p><p>like crack of McNeill’s voice. From Ling’s </p><p>agate eyes showed a momentary gleam that </p><p>might have been the light of any of a dozen </p><p>emotions, none of them friendly. The </p><p>gleam died before the steady light in the </p><p>coldly blue orbs of McNeill. Ling turned </p><p>away with the ghost of a shifting grin on his </p><p>yellow face. To his shrill syllables two of </p><p>the men shuffled off toward the camels and </p><p>three others after the horses. </p><p> A flap in the humpback tent of native</p><p>design was thrown back, and a girl came out, </p><p>slim in her brown holland riding togs, </p><p>putteed, helmeted with a pith topcc, her skin </p><p>slightly tanned, her eyes even bluer than </p><p>McNeill’s and her hair yellow as ripe corn. </p><p>She was barely up to McNeill’s shoulder, </p><p>but there was no suggestion of delicacy </p><p>about her slender figure or the free vigor </p><p>with which she walked towards him. </p><p> “I suppose there is no water to spare for</p><p>anything but tea,” she said. “Not for </p><p>myself, though I am gritty and grimy to the </p><p>last degree, but father is fussing about </p><p>shaving.” </p><p> McNeill ran his fingers over the stiff red</p><p>stubble of his own lean jaws and grinned. </p><p> “Not a chance of it before nightfall,” he</p><p>answered. “I wish you’d ask him to hurry. </p><p>We’ve got to be moving. Have to eat in </p><p>the saddle this morning.” </p><p> She looked at him inquiringly but turned</p><p>and went back to the tent while McNeill </p><p>gazed after her admiringly. Then he </p><p>wheeled. Ling had come up behind him </p><p>noiselessly. </p><p> “Well?” asked McNeill.</p><p> “One of the camels is very sick—too sick</p><p>to travel.” </p><p> “Slit its throat and leave all its load. We</p><p>can get along without tents for the next </p><p>three nights.” </p><p> Ling looked at bun evilly.</p><p> “Four of the horses are badly galled,” he</p><p>said. “Three more are sick. We have </p><p>come too far, too fast. We must rest.” </p><p> “You know we are short of water,” said</p><p>McNeill. “Why do you disobey my or- </p><p>ders?” </p><p> “It is not possible to obey them, O, my</p><p>overlord,” answered Ling, his face deferen- </p><p>tial, eyelids down, his soft voice impudent. </p><p> Back of him the Mongols had gathered in</p><p>The Dragon’s Claw </p><p>141 </p><p>a half-ring, looking covertly out of almond </p><p>eyes that glittered like those of snakes. </p><p> McNeill’s left arm shot out, caught the</p><p>waist-cloth of Ling and drew the giant to- </p><p>ward him. Ling’s right hand shot down </p><p>to the haft of his knife, but, swifter still, </p><p>McNeill had drawn his automatic and </p><p>jabbed its blunt muzzle hard into the </p><p>stomach of the Mongol. </p><p> “You dog,” he said, “drop that knife!</p><p>Drop it or-” </p><p> Ling’s unwrinkled lids were wide now.</p><p>In his stare came the red light that shoots </p><p>from the black opal and tells of hate and </p><p>murder. But the knife dropped to the </p><p>sand and McNeill put his foot upon it. </p><p>Then he swiftly searched Ling for more </p><p>weapons, found another knife and a cheap </p><p>revolver with three cartridges in the cylin- </p><p>der. The shells he tossed far away with a </p><p>jerk, flinging the pistol after them. </p><p> “Miss Remsden!” he called.</p><p> The girl came running out of the tent.</p><p>Behind her followed a stout man with a </p><p>fussy, important face that was scorched </p><p>rather than tanned, whose clothes fitted him </p><p>badly and became him worse; a bow-legged, </p><p>bow-stomached person who most evidently </p><p>essayed to be a personage and who strutted </p><p>like a gosling. His pale gray eyes were </p><p>inclined to pop and now they strained at the </p><p>action going forward. </p><p> “What’s this McNeill, what’s this?” he de-</p><p>manded in a pompous voice. McNeill paid </p><p>no attention to him, speaking to the girl. </p><p> “My rifle—in my tent! And then get</p><p>yours!” </p><p> She got the first and sped back for the</p><p>second. McNeill stepped back from Ling </p><p>who had stood immovable since the drop- </p><p>ping of the knife. The muzzle of the rifle </p><p>swung in an arc of command about the </p><p>semicircle of Mongols. </p><p> “First to move, moves once only,”</p><p>warned McNeill. “Now then, Mr. Rems- </p><p>den, please go over them carefully and re-</p><p>move all their weapons. Miss Helen will </p><p>help you cover them one by one as you go </p><p>about it.” </p><p> Remsden’s red face had gone patchy and</p><p>his hands shook but the nervousness of the </p><p>man was evidently purely physical. He </p><p>was not a coward and he nerved himself up </p><p>to his task, backed by the girl. At </p><p>McNeill’s directions he tossed the miscel- </p><p>laneous assortment of weapons into a heap. </p><p>The latter ordered Ling to make them into </p><p>a bundle, using a sheepskin and tying the </p><p>package firmly with strips of leather. </p><p> “I’ll carry this,” said McNeill, “till we</p><p>come to the first hole, dirt or water. Now </p><p>then break camp, leave the tents and heavy </p><p>baggage. Saddle up! Jump!” </p><p>THEY jumped and McNeill, rifle at </p><p>carry, walked to his own tent and </p><p>picked up his field-glasses as the </p><p>Mongols, spurred into feverish activity, </p><p>stripped down the canvas. McNeill fo- </p><p>cussed his lenses and looked anxiously to- </p><p>ward the western hills. After a little hesi- </p><p>tation Remsden camc over to him. </p><p> “What have you found out, Neill?” he</p><p>asked. “What was it? A mutiny?” </p><p> McNeill turned on him.</p><p> “I’ll answer you that question,” he said,</p><p>“when you tell me what you were up to at </p><p>the temple. I suspected something when </p><p>you wanted to come away in such a tearing </p><p>hurry.” </p><p> Remsden blinked at him from between</p><p>his sandy eyelashes. </p><p> “Why there was nothing to stay for any</p><p>longer,” he said. “We had seen the ritual. </p><p>I had got all I wanted.” </p><p> “I don’t doubt it,” said McNeill. “The</p><p>point is, what did you get?” </p><p> Remsden blustered.</p><p> “I employed you as guide and interpreter,</p><p>Mr. McNeill, not to poke into my private </p><p>affairs.” </p><p> “As things have turned out they are my</p><p>private affairs,” said McNeill coldly, “if my </p><p>life is my private affair, which I think it is. </p><p>To say nothing of your stepdaughter’s life, </p><p>I don’t know just how highly you value </p><p>your own.” </p><p> He broke off to hasten the final prepara-</p><p>tions for departure. The girl was already </p><p>mounted. Remsden got patchy again and </p><p>then his face flamed angrily. </p><p> “You have given me no explanation,” he</p><p>barked. “I repeat that whatever I do on </p><p>this trip for which I hired you, has nothing </p><p>to do with the contract. What lias hap- </p><p>pened?” </p><p> “I caught Ling heliographing to a party</p><p>in the hills,” said McNeill briefly. “I </p><p>think he was answering orders to delay us. </p><p>I took up a collection of their cutlery to </p><p>prevent a throat-cutting. I don’t know yet </p><p>whether I have succeeded. Look at that </p><p>dust cloud there where the sun catches it. </p><p>That’s a party after us and they will come </p><p>142 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>swiftly. I’ll bet a thousand dollars they </p><p>are priests of the Hoang Lung.” </p><p> He caught the shifting of Remsden’s eyes</p><p>and nodded. </p><p> “I thought so,” he added. “I don’t</p><p>know what you’ve been up to, but it’s </p><p>three days to Peking, seventy-two hours, </p><p>and just about a seventy-two to one shot </p><p>that we don’t get there. Better get on your </p><p>horse, Mr. Remsden. Ling, that’s the pass </p><p>you talked about last night, isn’t it? How </p><p>far is it?” </p><p> He pointed to two dark purple juts low on</p><p>the eastern rim of the plain. Ling’s eyes </p><p>glinted. </p><p> “Twelve hours,” he said. “If the horses</p><p>and camels hold out.” </p><p> “They’ll have to. But we won’t go</p><p>that way Ling. We’ll strike south until we </p><p>strike the Chang-Li River. We’ll keep in </p><p>the gullies out of sight. I’m going to ride </p><p>in the rear, Ling, and if I think, or if I </p><p>should just happen to think, that you are </p><p>trying to signal back any change of our </p><p>plans, I’ll shoot the lot of you. I’ll defile </p><p>your bodies and leave them to the vultures. </p><p>I’ll cut off your queues and burn them to </p><p>ashes. Get my meaning? You do? Then </p><p>start!” </p><p> Ling snarled like a trapped wolf, openly,</p><p>forgetting to mask his feelings. McNeill </p><p>grinned back at liim. The girl rode over to </p><p>the latter’s side and he changed the grin to </p><p>a smile as he surveyed her fearless eyes and </p><p>her trim seat on the pony. </p><p> “We are in some danger, Mr. McNeill?”</p><p>she asked. He looked at her and frankly </p><p>nodded. </p><p> “And then some,” he added, a bit grimly.</p><p>“Thank God I’m not afraid to tell you. </p><p>But we are going to get out of it all right.” </p><p> “I’m sure of that,” she replied quietly and</p><p>rode ahead to join her stepfather. </p><p> McNeill’s smile came back as he surveyed</p><p>her. As the little caravan descended into a</p><p>shallow ravine with rocks protruding here </p><p>and there through the sand like dry bones, </p><p>he began to whistle softly. A scrap was for- </p><p>ward, and McNeill loved a fight. It was only </p><p>when he thought of the girl that the muscles </p><p>in his jaws tightened and the whistle was in- </p><p>terrupted. </p><p> Back in the western hills the dust cloud</p><p>moved swiftly down and out into the plain, </p><p>steel points and blades twinkling here and </p><p>there as the sun pierced the veil of floating </p><p>soil. </p><p> CHAPTER II</p><p>IN THE CANON </p><p>DOWN in the blackness of the ravine tin </p><p>thin thread that still persisted in the </p><p>watercourse tinkled over the flinty stones. </p><p>The walls of the canon lifted clear and </p><p>sheer five hundred feet, dark blots of purple. </p><p>The narrow strip of sky above them, as seen </p><p>from the floor of this valley, suddenly ap- </p><p>pearing in the sandy desert as if the granite </p><p>precipices had thrust themselves up through </p><p>the yielding soil, was studded with stars. </p><p>There was no sound but the sharp voice of </p><p>the waters emerging from the sands to lose </p><p>themselves again where the ravine ended. </p><p> A perilous ledge led along the western cliff</p><p>and passed the black gorge of a cave that </p><p>slanted sharply upwards after a brief passage </p><p>that ran back level for perhaps a hundred </p><p>feet. At the mouth of the cave, rifle across </p><p>his knee, sat Neill McNeill, craving for the </p><p>smoke he might not permit himself. </p><p> Forty-eight hours had passed since they</p><p>left the camp where he had caught Ling </p><p>heliographing, and all his senses warned </p><p>him that danger was very close at hand. </p><p>He knew it from the attitude of Ling and his </p><p>followers. Their surliness was lightened; </p><p>they had seen, had heard, or smelled some- </p><p>thing that liis over-civilized perceptions had </p><p>missed. He knew the priests must have </p><p>been misled at first but they were indubi- </p><p>tably far better mounted than the Remsden </p><p>party, and not all McNeill’s skill had been </p><p>able to obliterate trails. </p><p> Both nights he had bound the Mongols</p><p>hand and foot. By day he herded them. </p><p>They were utterly one with the pursuit; </p><p>they were eating up the scant supply of food</p><p>and at times tried to delay the march, until </p><p>McNeill threatened to shoot the first recal- </p><p>citrant, but, if he left them free, it would </p><p>but be to augment and advise the enemy, </p><p>and he had a plan in mind by which </p><p>he could still use them, despite their </p><p>wishes. </p><p> Both the camels he had killed as too slow,</p><p>taking valuable time to bury them deep so </p><p>that the clustering carrion birds should not </p><p>act as guides. Only two of the horses were </p><p>in any shape to travel. Remsden had </p><p>ruined two already with his weight and </p><p>clumsy riding. The detour had delayed </p><p>them, and they were still thirty hours from </p><p>the outskirts of Peking. And, until they </p><p>The Dragon’s Claw </p><p>143 </p><p>reached the foreign quarter of that city, they </p><p>could not reckon themselves safe. </p><p> “Possibly not then,” meditated McNeill,</p><p>watching the opposite sky-line. </p><p> There was no trail on the face of the other</p><p>cliff, so he covered the ledge on their own </p><p>side and was on guard against surprize. </p><p>At the end of the straight tunnel Remsden </p><p>and Helen lay resting, if not asleep. Ling </p><p>and the rest were tucked in a niche, none too </p><p>comfortably, and McNeill himself had tied </p><p>the soaked hide-strips that fettered them. </p><p> “I wonder,” he went on in thought, “just</p><p>what the old boy did back there at the </p><p>temple. He was hobnobbing with that </p><p>sleek rat, Fung-Ti, who got beaten out for </p><p>high-priest at the last Hoang Lung election. </p><p>Remsden’s got his own ambitions. He’d </p><p>rather be head of the Museum of Philologi- </p><p>cal Research than anything in this world, or </p><p>the next for that matter. He’d barter all </p><p>he has for that, his stepdaughter included. </p><p>When it comes down to his own ends he’s a </p><p>devil of selfishness. A-ha!” </p><p> He cuddled up his rifle lightly, leaning</p><p>forward from the ledge. There was more </p><p>than a hint of moonrise across the ravine, </p><p>and his ears had caught the clink of metal— </p><p>not hoof on stone, since few horses were shod </p><p>in that region, but blade or point against </p><p>stirrup. </p><p> Then, silhouetted against the radiance of</p><p>the eastern sky, back so far from the edge </p><p>that only the upper parts of their bodies </p><p>showed, there came a file of horsemen. </p><p>The riders wore queer, pointed caps and </p><p>flowing robes. He could see spears and </p><p>guns aslant their shoulders. They rode </p><p>fast, and he counted over fifty. </p><p> There was a slight shuffle beside him.</p><p>Ling, bound as he was, had wriggled his way </p><p>to the front of the cave. His clothes had </p><p>caught on something, and the force he had </p><p>summoned to break free had betrayed him, </p><p>even as he raised his face and opened his </p><p>mouth to shout to the dark riders across the </p><p>canon. </p><p> With a sidelong sweep McNeill brought</p><p>the butt of his gun down on the base of the </p><p>Mongol’s skull, and the cry died in his </p><p>throat. But it was a close call, and McNeill </p><p>patrolled the cave to the niche where he </p><p>inspected his prisoners and gagged them </p><p>with dirty strips from their own clothes, </p><p>threatening them with a knife if they made </p><p>the tiniest sound. Then he went back to </p><p>where he had left Ling. </p><p> The ledge was empty.</p><p> “Came to and rolled himself over,” Mc-</p><p>Neill decided. “Now I wonder just </p><p>why.” </p><p> The answer came to him almost imme-</p><p>diately. The riders were coming back </p><p>again, and McNeill could see two of them </p><p>dismount and peer down into the black gulf, </p><p>evidently suspicious of the sound they had </p><p>heard—the slump of Ling into the canon. </p><p>He could have picked them off easily, but </p><p>to remain hidden was of paramount impor- </p><p>tance. They had but a small supply of </p><p>water. Besieged in the cave, they must </p><p>soon give in. </p><p> No other sound came from the fallen</p><p>Ling who had sacrificed himself in vain to </p><p>serve the fierce priests of Hoang Lung. </p><p>The smashing drop of a quarter of a thou- </p><p>sand feet had beaten the life out of him. </p><p> “They’ll stay till morning,” McNeill told</p><p>himself, “and then they’ll find him, un- </p><p>less-” </p><p> He went back to the end of the tunnel</p><p>where the natural rift narrowed and went </p><p>up in a narrow, irregular ramp. Under this </p><p>McNeill paused. Once he wetted his finger </p><p>and held it up in the darkness. He thought </p><p>he could detect a faint stirring of the air. </p><p>From the pocket of the coat he wore, for </p><p>the night air was chill, he fished out an </p><p>electric torch and slipped the switch. The </p><p>beam fell on the sleeping face of Helen </p><p>Remsden, as she was styled, having adopted </p><p>the name of her stepparent. McNeill’s </p><p>jaw hardened as he gazed at the beauty that </p><p>even the cruel forcing of the last two days’ </p><p>flight could not eradicate. From an angle </p><p>to the right where the tunnel side-pocketed </p><p>came the faint stamping of horses and the </p><p>reek of their bodies. Then he shifted the </p><p>ray to Remsden’s puffy countenance and, </p><p>stooping, shook him by the shoulder.</p><p> “Eh, what?”</p><p> “Ssh!” cautioned McNeill. “Come with</p><p>me to the cave mouth. 1 want a talk with </p><p>you.” </p><p> His tone was imperative and Remsden</p><p>yielded to it without further grumbling. </p><p>By this time the moon had topped the </p><p>further wall and was whitening the ledge </p><p>outside. By and by its light would steal </p><p>down into the depths and, perhaps, reveal </p><p>the body of Ling, sure sign that the white </p><p>men were beleaguered near by. </p><p> McNeill thought of climbing down and</p><p>either bringing back the body or hiding it </p><p>144 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> beneath loose stones. But, in such dark-</p><p>ness, he could not hope to eradicate all </p><p>marks of the fall from the sharp eyes that </p><p>would surely be seeking for them as soon as </p><p>light permitted. There would be spatters </p><p>of blood and, in the meantime, there were </p><p>other things to do—hopes to work on. </p><p>Remsden was one of these latter. </p><p>McNEILL tackled his employer </p><p>without formality. </p><p> “Remsden, we are in - bad</p><p>shape. They’ve got us cornered. The </p><p>Hoang Lung crowd has just filed along the </p><p>cliff across the way. They are suspicious of </p><p>this place and they’ll hang around till </p><p>morning. There are only two horses fit to </p><p>travel.” </p><p> “How do you know they are the Hoang</p><p>Lung crowd? They may be just a band of </p><p>robbers with whom Ling was in league.” </p><p> “I’ll bet you know it is the Hoang Lung</p><p>outfit better than I do, Remsden. In </p><p>point of fact, it doesn’t matter who they are, </p><p>so long as they are hostile. If they get us— </p><p>well what they do to us two men don’t </p><p>count so much. I’ll take good care they </p><p>don’t get Miss Helen alive, but they are </p><p>nasty devils and their sort of vengeance </p><p>don’t stop at death. Now I am pretty </p><p>certain you’ve got us in this scrape— </p><p>something you’ve done at the temple. If it </p><p>was sacrilege we can’t help it now. If </p><p>you’ve stolen something, you and that sleek </p><p>rat of a Fung-Ti, perhaps they’ll make </p><p>terms with us if you give it up. And it’s </p><p>up to you to do it.” </p><p> Remsden’s beefy face was rigid with</p><p>obstinacy. </p><p> “I’ve done nothing that can be undone,”</p><p>he said. </p><p> McNeill, keeping the ray shaded from</p><p>without, suddenly threw the light on </p><p>Remsden’s face and surveyed him keenly. </p><p>The pop-eyes showed only a sullen dogged- </p><p>ness. </p><p> “It was all right for you to risk your own</p><p>life for whatever you were after,” went on </p><p>McNeill, “but, though you told me and told </p><p>your stepdaughter you only wanted to wit- </p><p>ness the ritual, I don’t believe you. But </p><p>now you are risking her life and mine for </p><p>that matter. You’ve fooled both of us. </p><p>It’s two lives against yours and both of </p><p>them younger ones. Ling somehow slid off </p><p>this cliff a little while ago,” he went on </p><p>moodily. “You might do the same thing.” </p><p> “You mean you would kill me?”</p><p> “If I were sure you had something on you</p><p>that would save the girl’s life by giving it </p><p>up, I would, without compunction.” </p><p>Remsden gulped. </p><p> “You can search me if you like, McNeill.</p><p>I’ve got nothing on me. You can search </p><p>my baggage, destroy it if you like. You’ll </p><p>find nothing. I wanted to see the ritual. </p><p>I	may have offended them, but you’re on</p><p>the wrong track. There must be some way </p><p>out of this. It isn’t just a question of </p><p>money, McNeill. I told you I’d give you </p><p>a bonus if the trip was satisfactory. I’ll </p><p>double that. I’ll triple it if you get me </p><p>safe into Peking. That was in the contract </p><p>—to guard as well as guide. Get me safe </p><p>into Peking, McNeill, and I’ll give you a </p><p>thousand dollars. I’ll give you five.” </p><p> “1 wouldn't accept five cents for trying to</p><p>save your skin,” said McNeill. “I’ll do the </p><p>best I can for you as per contract. Now </p><p>you get back to the end of the cave. I’ll </p><p>need you presently.” </p><p> “You think we can get away?” asked</p><p>Remsden persistently. </p><p> “I said for you to get inside,” said</p><p>McNeill so grimly that the stout man crept </p><p>obediently away. </p><p> Presently McNeill followed him. The</p><p>girl was still sleeping. He switched his ray </p><p>into the rift above his head and clambered </p><p>up the slanting way. It was some four </p><p>feet wide and the sides were damp with </p><p>moisture. It narrowed, but he wormed his </p><p>way on and then backed down again. </p><p> “It goes through,” he said to himself.</p><p>“And it’s all soft earth, I’m fairly certain— </p><p>just a landslide. There’s a chance—for her.</p><p>And, by the Eternal, we’ll open it up if I </p><p>work those Chinks’ fingers to slivers of bone. </p><p> He kicked up the drowsy Mongols, prod-</p><p>ding them with a knife in one hand, threat- </p><p>ening them with his pistol in the other, </p><p>explaining to them what he wanted. </p><p> Soon they were at work with stirrup-</p><p>irons, with pots and metal cups, with jagged </p><p>cans, one above the other in a living ladder, </p><p>digging at the soft soil, passing it down in </p><p>improvised sacks and panniers from the </p><p>pack animals, working desperately under </p><p>McNeill’s supervision. They labored in </p><p>the dark, save for occasional spurts of the </p><p>torch, but they made good progress. </p><p>Remsden watched without speaking to </p><p>McNeill who had no time to spare for him, </p><p>and then the girl awoke and came feeling </p><p>The Dragon’s Claw </p><p>145 </p><p>through the dusk of the cave to see what </p><p>was happening. McNeill spared a minute </p><p>or so to tell her. </p><p> “They’ll locate us by morning,” he said.</p><p>“But they won’t lind us. I was sure I </p><p>noted a current of air passing down this </p><p>shaft that has filled up in some landslide </p><p>during winter rains. It is not at all prob- </p><p>able they know of its existence. Once we </p><p>break through we can get the ponies up </p><p>there and make a clean getaway while they </p><p>are trying to rush the ledge or fooling about </p><p>in the bottom of the ravine. We can hold </p><p>them off from the cave-front indefinitely.” </p><p>“As long as we have water,” she corrected. </p><p>“There’s moisture enough in that shaft </p><p>to keep us going for a while,” answered </p><p>McNeill. “But I’ll make shift to show </p><p>them our Chinese friends we have with us </p><p>and, as long as they think they have us </p><p>trapped, they’ll go leisurely about it. In </p><p>the meantime you and Mr. Remsden will </p><p>be streaking for Peking.” </p><p> “And you, what are you going to do?”</p><p>“Me? I’m going to amuse myself giving </p><p>a lesson in marksmanship to the Hoang </p><p>Lung crowd until I’ve made them very shy </p><p>of doing anything else but try and starve us </p><p>out. You see they won’t figure we have a </p><p>back door and not use it. Then, when </p><p>I’ve got them cautious, I’ll come scooting </p><p>hotfoot after you two. There’s the Piu- </p><p>kiang River ten miles east-by-north, and </p><p>there are little villages here and there. </p><p>You must buy a boat or steal one and take </p><p>to the stream. Steal one if you can, it’ll </p><p>leave less trace.” </p><p> “You keep on saying ‘you,’ ” she said.</p><p>“You get a boat. We shall wait for </p><p>you.” </p><p> “No you won’t,” McNeill answered.</p><p>“I may have to strike quite another trail. </p><p>Once out, we must scatter and join as best </p><p>we can. You stick by your stepfather. </p><p>I’ll show up.” </p><p> She was silent for a minute. Then she</p><p>objected— </p><p> “There are only two horses that can</p><p>travel.”</p><p> “Three,” lied McNeill. “The yellow</p><p>pony is feeling fine again.” </p><p> “Are you telling me the truth?” she</p><p>asked. </p><p> “Ask Mr. Remsden,” said McNeill.</p><p> “Father!” she appealed.</p><p> '‘Yes, my dear, Mr. McNeill knows what</p><p>is best. There are three horses. We must </p><p>10 </p><p>rely upon his judgment. Those coolies are </p><p>slacking up I think.” </p><p> McNeill went after the Mongols, and the</p><p>girl subsided. He did not dare to leave the </p><p>workmen though he dreaded letting the </p><p>body of Ling remain in plain sight in the </p><p>ravine. Not that it much mattered, he </p><p>thought, if they got through the tunnel all </p><p>right. His own chance of getting away on </p><p>the yellow pony was pretty slim, but his </p><p>duty, as he saw it, was to see to the best </p><p>chances of the girl and of the man who had </p><p>indubitably employed him as guard as well </p><p>as guide. </p><p> The current of air was steadily stronger.</p><p>Now and then he climbed Up among the </p><p>men, blinding them with his light, ignoring </p><p>the murder in their faces, making them turn </p><p>their backs while he inspected, whipping </p><p>them with his will and the fear of death </p><p>lest they strangle him in a sudden rush. </p><p>It would not do to let them get too close </p><p>to the ultimate opening. That he must </p><p>clear himself, or they would give the alarm. </p><p> And, after hours of incredible toil, the</p><p>thing was done. It was close to dawn and </p><p>the moon had gone, with the stars paling, </p><p>when McNeill broke through to the open </p><p>and found a fortunate masking of bushes </p><p>and scrub trees all about the hole. Once </p><p>again he herded the bound Mongols to their </p><p>niche and then, with Remsden struggling </p><p>with blistering hands to help him, the two </p><p>white men enlarged the mouth of the shaft </p><p>until it was wide enough to allow the egress </p><p>of the dwarf ponies. All this time the girl </p><p>stood on watch where the horizontal tunnel </p><p>opened on the ledge, above the crushed body </p><p>of Ling, while the mists began to wisp out </p><p>of the ravine and the sunrise was imminent. </p><p>McNEILL got the two horses up the </p><p>incline and saddled them, while </p><p>Remsden gathered such provisions </p><p>as they would need. Then McNeill fetched </p><p>the girl. </p><p> He pointed out to them the lay of the land</p><p>that sloped toward the little river that, in </p><p>its turn, would bring them out on the water- </p><p>highway to Peking. He gave them brief </p><p>instructions as to their course, handing </p><p>them the maps and two rifles with ammuni- </p><p>tion. Remsden could use enough Chinese </p><p>dialect to make his offers of money under- </p><p>stood and, as long as they kept ahead of </p><p>the fanatic priests and their influence, Mc- </p><p>Neill had little doubt that they could buy </p><p>146 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>their safety to Peking. At the last mo- </p><p>ment, when McNeill had crawled off to the </p><p>cliff edge on a reconnoitering expedition, </p><p>the girl rebelled. </p><p> “We shall not go without McNeill,” she</p><p>declared. “At least I shall not. He is </p><p>deliberately sacrificing himself for us.” </p><p>“You are talking foolishly, my dear,” </p><p>answered Remsden nervously. “McNeill </p><p>is not a fool. He is not throwing away his </p><p>own life. I have promised to reward him </p><p>munificiently when we are safe in Peking, </p><p>and-” </p><p> The girl looked at him scornfully.</p><p> “You think everything can be bought</p><p>with gold,” she said. </p><p> “Well,” answered her stepfather with</p><p>smug complacence, “there are few things </p><p>that can not. By the way, you may give </p><p>me back the wallet. It will be safe with </p><p>me now. I was afraid of light fingers while </p><p>the Chinese were with us. I sleep so much </p><p>sounder than you.” </p><p> Contempt still in her eyes, the girl took a</p><p>leather wallet from her bosom and gave it to </p><p>Remsden. The latter furtively fingered its </p><p>bulk and slid it out of sight before Mc- </p><p>Neill came back through the brush. </p><p> “They are down in the ravine,” he said.</p><p>“They have found the body of Ling. </p><p>Soon they will be coming along the ledge. </p><p>I shall use our prisoners as a barrier until </p><p>you have got well away. Then I shall </p><p>come after you, but do not wait for me. I </p><p>am sure you will get through all right, and </p><p>there is no need to worry about me. I shall </p><p>be at the Imperial Hotel within a few hours </p><p>after you—perhaps before. Take the right- </p><p>hand gully. Go slowly at first and be </p><p>careful not to throw up any dust. If you </p><p>find a boat get rid of the ponies. Don’t </p><p>give them away; turn them loose as soon as </p><p>you see your way clear on the river. Now </p><p>off with you; I have got to get back to the </p><p>entrance.” </p><p> He saw the rebellion in Helen’s eyes.</p><p> “/1m revoir, Miss Remsden,” he said.</p><p>“Let me help you mount. I assure you </p><p>that I am in no more danger in remaining </p><p>than you in going—probably less. On my </p><p>word of honor!” </p><p> She looked deep into his eyes and slowly</p><p>blushed. </p><p> “If you do not arrive when you say,</p><p>within a few hours of us,” she said, so low </p><p>that Remsden, for all his straining ears, </p><p>could not catch the words, “I shall come </p><p>back after you.” </p><p> McNeill saw them disappear into the</p><p>gully, his hat off to the girl, and then </p><p>hastened down again to the tunnel. He </p><p>picked out one of the Mongols and pricked </p><p>him ahead with his knife-blade until the </p><p>latter showed himself reluctantly at the cave </p><p>entrance. </p><p> Immediately there was a flash from the</p><p>opposite cliff, the singing of a bullet, the </p><p>spang of its lead on the rocky lintel of the </p><p>cave and the echoing report. The China- </p><p>man shrank back, and McNeill laughed. </p><p> “They meant that for me, Ba-ti,” he said.</p><p>“Presently I’ll return the compliment.” </p><p> He had no intention of firing where he</p><p>was not sure of a target. Every moment </p><p>gained helped Remsden and the girl and, </p><p>when he did fire, he wanted to put the fear </p><p>of his marksmanship into the priests. They </p><p>thought they had him earthed. A good </p><p>shot or so would make them cautious. </p><p> He tightened up the foot-ropes of the</p><p>Mongol and put him back with the rest. </p><p>Then he made a little barricade of loose </p><p>stones and sat down to guard the ledge. </p><p>He did not dare expose himself to harass </p><p>those in the ravine but he hoped that they </p><p>would attempt to rush the narrow path. </p><p> Two hours passed and then a fusillade of</p><p>bullets smashed about the cave mouth and </p><p>buzzed down the tunnel. The comers of </p><p>McNeill’s mouth turned up into a little grin. </p><p>He squinted down the ledge, lying flat in a </p><p>conduit he had made of the rocks, thrusting </p><p>his rifle through a niche. </p><p> As he expected, a rush was on. A cluster</p><p>of racing figures turned a shoulder of rock </p><p>and McNeill began firing rapidly, but with </p><p>definite aim. Two figures leaped up and </p><p>plunged into the gulf; another sprawled out </p><p>on the ledge; a fourth dragged back around </p><p>the buttress. </p><p> “That will keep them thinking for a</p><p>while,” McNeill told himself. “I wonder </p><p>how about the other direction?” </p><p> He turned over and, even as he turned,</p><p>heard the soft pad of swiftly running feet. </p><p>The priests of Hoang Lung had split and </p><p>had meant to attack simultaneously. Some </p><p>inequalities of the path had hindered their </p><p>perfect junction, and once again McNeill’s </p><p>rifle took heavy toll. Two men, shot almost </p><p>simultaneously, whirled, clutched at each </p><p>other and went spinning down. </p><p> “That’ll teach ’em not to be in too much</p><p>of a hurry,” muttered McNeill as he slid </p><p>The Dragon’s Claw </p><p>147 </p><p>fresh cartridges into the chamber while </p><p>stray bullets still sung and splashed above </p><p>him. “I don’t believe they’ve got more </p><p>than a couple of rifles at that,” he told him- </p><p>self. “Now for the next move. I don’t </p><p>believe they’ll try another rush—try and </p><p>starve us out. I don’t fancy they are wor- </p><p>rying much about those Chinks I’ve got </p><p>corraled. Neither am I. I wonder how </p><p>many miles are left in that yellow cayuse.” </p><p> His half-formed plan crystallized as he</p><p>went back into the tunnel and flashed his </p><p>torch over the bunch of bound Mongols. </p><p>One man he selected as close to his own </p><p>build, though lacking in height. This man </p><p>he shuffled back to where the rest of the </p><p>horses were stalled and, at the muzzle of </p><p>his automatic, ordered him to strip. The </p><p>man demurred, and McNeill clipped him </p><p>on the jaw with his pistol, putting him out. </p><p>Then he deftly peeled off the dirty, unsavory </p><p>clothes and reluctantly put these on over </p><p>his own underwear, after investing the </p><p>Chinaman with the outer garb of Neill </p><p>McNeill. </p><p> The battery of his torch was dimming,</p><p>fast as he had worked, and it flickered en- </p><p>tirely out before he had finished. But he </p><p>got the limping pony to the top of the shaft </p><p>and the Chinaman with it. He had col- </p><p>lected the few things he meant to take with </p><p>him^and now, with the wondering, hating </p><p>eyes of the Mongol watching him, he </p><p>crawled through the bushes for a last survey </p><p>of the enemy, crawled back and, with almost </p><p>the last of his water supply, unflinchingly </p><p>scraped off with a dull blade all the sprout- </p><p>ing red growth on his jaws. </p><p> Then he surveyed the lay of the land.</p><p>To one side, where, almost three hours </p><p>before, Remsden and his daughter had made </p><p>for the river, the fissures offered him ample </p><p>cover. To the other the land opened to a </p><p>flat plateau sparsely set with dwarf growths. </p><p> McNeill forced the Mongol to mount the</p><p>tethered yellow pony that was in no way </p><p>anxious to move, tied his feet under the </p><p>animal’s belly and his wrists to the saddle- </p><p>horn. Once again he slid through the bushes </p><p>and fired a random shot across the canon. </p><p>The echoes crashed as answering bullets</p><p>came wildly back. He cut the tether, </p><p>headed the pony for the plateau, pricked it </p><p>sharply on the flank and fired a couple of </p><p>shots beneath it that sent it flying fearfully </p><p>through the scrub bearing a figure in Euro- </p><p>pean costume on its back, crouching to </p><p>avoid the missiles that sped toward it at </p><p>long range, and then McNeill dived swiftly </p><p>into the nearest depression and, making the </p><p>most of his start, fled for the Chang-Li </p><p>stream. </p><p> At nightfall McNeill squatted by the</p><p>wall of a hut. Outside its door the Chinese </p><p>were gabbling the local gossip. The boat </p><p>of Duk Sing had been stolen. Sing had </p><p>found it gone when he started for the eve- </p><p>ning fishing. The boat had vanished, but a </p><p>gold piece was lying by the tether picket, </p><p>wrapped in a scrap of cloth. So Sing was </p><p>lucky, for the boat was old. And Chee Foy </p><p>had found two ponies with their saddles. </p><p>It had been a great day, said Wong Lee, the </p><p>headman. It was good to talk but he </p><p>must be going, for the tide was right and </p><p>they were waiting for his cargo in Peking. </p><p>He envied Sing his luck; money was scarce. </p><p> As Wong Lee started to go aboard his</p><p>cargo-boat where the polers only awaited </p><p>his coming, a figure came out of the darkness </p><p>and asked in the dialect of the district for a </p><p>trip passage. </p><p> “Not free, oh Wong Lee,” said the</p><p>pleader as the headman scowled. “For, by </p><p>the favor of my aunt, I have some small </p><p>matter of money with me, and the trip is ur- </p><p>gent. I am sick.” </p><p> There was a lire burning on an iron plate</p><p>amidships of the long craft with its thatched </p><p>cabin and high prow. By the uncertain </p><p>light Wong Lee looked doubtfully at the </p><p>stranger. The man’s head was bound up in </p><p>filthy cloths that concealed all but a strip </p><p>showing nose and cheek-bones. The brow </p><p>bandage came so low as to hide the eyes. </p><p> “What is thy sickness?” asked Wong Lee.</p><p>“And where is thy money?” </p><p> “It is not catching. Lo, I have been</p><p>suffering long from decayed teeth and the </p><p>night air brings on the pain, so I journey </p><p>to Peking to seek a doctor. Here is half of </p><p>what I possess.”</p><p> Out of the waistcloth in which his auto-</p><p>matic was tucked away handily, McNeill </p><p>produced some copper cash and two small </p><p>pieces of gold. He held these out on a palm </p><p>blackened with dirt. Wong Lee swept all </p><p>of it into his own paw. </p><p> “Get aboard,” he said magnanimously.</p><p>“I will send thee to a cousin of mine who is </p><p>a mighty doctor in Peking. Pole, pole </p><p>swiftly, ye doghearts, the tide runs.” </p><p> As the cargo boat shot out into the</p><p>stream, McNeill, glancing back, saw torches </p><p>148 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>suddenly break out in the village and heard </p><p>the racket of voices that betokened the </p><p>sudden arrival of some cavalcade. Some </p><p>one ran down toward the river-landing </p><p>swinging a flare and shouted, but Wong </p><p>Lee, with an oath, took no notice and the </p><p>craft shot swiftly down the broad stream. </p><p>None but the boatmen had seen McNeill </p><p>and that at the last moment. If the new </p><p>arrivals were the priests of the Hoang-Lung </p><p>they had no reason to suspect the entirely </p><p>regular departure of Wong Lee. There </p><p>came a bend in the stream and the shouts </p><p>and lights died out, and McNeill cuddled </p><p>down on some mats in the cabin, groaning a </p><p>little from time to Lime about the decayed </p><p>teeth that he was forced to protect against </p><p>the night air. </p><p>CHAPTER HI </p><p>THE FEATURES OF FUNG-TI </p><p>AFTER nine years of wanderings in in- </p><p>terior China, prospecting, engineering, </p><p>adventuring, Neill McNeill, with his knowl- </p><p>edge of customs and dialects, was compara- </p><p>tively at home in Peking. He changed his </p><p>filthy rags for Occidental raiment at a </p><p>nalive lailor’s who was lo him more of a </p><p>friend than a mere tradesman and, Lhus </p><p>rehabiliLated, hurried to the Imperial Hotel. </p><p> On the trip of the cargo-boat he had</p><p>found no trouble in picking up the trail of </p><p>the eccentric American and his daughler. </p><p>Remsden, wilh a smallering of Chinese, was </p><p>no fool and, once free from immediale pur- </p><p>suil, he had got together an escort and </p><p>traveled with speed and comfort. </p><p> McNeill’s connection with him would</p><p>soon be over, the latter thoughl regrel- </p><p>fully. He meant to Lake no bonus, for, </p><p>however much he admired the stepdaughler, </p><p>he had a very whilLled-down eslimalion of </p><p>Remsden and his selfishness that would </p><p>deliberately expose the girl to frightful risk </p><p>through his own rash actions. But McNeill </p><p>meant to see them both safely ouL of the </p><p>country. </p><p> The cult of the Hoang Lung, the guard-</p><p>ians of the holiesl of all shrines, was power- </p><p>ful and Remsden's offense, which must have</p><p>been a serious one, would not be lightly </p><p>condoned. Remsden was apt to consider </p><p>himself safe in Lhe foreign quarLer and be- </p><p>come careless. Trouble could easily hap- </p><p>pen, even on lhe train to Shanghai whence </p><p>they would embark for the States, and it </p><p>would be trouble of a kind that could not be </p><p>remedied. </p><p> A fanatic follower of the Hoang Lung</p><p>would think nothing of giving up his own </p><p>life and risking torlure if he achieved his </p><p>objecl. Even lhe arm of lhe American </p><p>government would be hard put to it to pro- </p><p>tect the travelers, and McNeill shrewdly </p><p>surmised that the American minister would </p><p>not be appealed to by Remsden too hur- </p><p>riedly, as the latter knew that confession </p><p>of an attempt on his part to interfere with </p><p>Chinese religious institutions would be met </p><p>with disfavor. </p><p> It was with relief that McNeill passed</p><p>through the arch inlo the holel compound </p><p>and entered the office of the Imperial. </p><p>Miss Remsden was oul, Lhe clerk declared, </p><p>bul Remsden was in his room. A package </p><p>had just been delivered for Mr. Remsden, </p><p>and the Chinese boy who ushered McNeill </p><p>-to the suite carried this parcel with him. </p><p> McNeill was frowning when he entered</p><p>the room. Remsden should not have al- </p><p>lowed his stepdaughter on the streets un- </p><p>escorted, he thought, though of course he </p><p>was nol cerlain lhal this was the case. </p><p>Remsden greeted him cordially enough. </p><p> “I’m glad to see you back, Neill, my boy,”</p><p>he said. “We were both anxious over your </p><p>safety but I assured Helen that you would </p><p>win through. We ourselves had a-” </p><p> “Where is Miss Helen?” broke in McNeill.</p><p>Remsden frowned at the interruption. </p><p>He was looking curiously at the package the </p><p>boy had broughl, a box some eight inches </p><p>square, wrapped in rice-paper on which was </p><p>inscribed in good English Remsden’s name </p><p>and address. </p><p> “She wanted to buy some souvenirs for</p><p>her friends at home,” he said. “I believe </p><p>she has gone to the Rising Sun Bazaar.” </p><p> “Good-, man!” cried McNeill. “You</p><p>don’t mean to say you let her go out </p><p>alone?” </p><p> “The Rising Sun Bazaar is only two</p><p>blocks away,” replied Remsden. “It is in </p><p>the foreign quarter. Have you lost your </p><p>nerve, Neill?” </p><p> “You have taken leave of your senses!”</p><p>said McNeill angrily, taking up his hat. </p><p>He was going Lo Lhe Bazaar wilhout delay. </p><p>“How long has she been gone?” </p><p> “Why, I hardly know,” said Remsden</p><p>leisurely, setling down his cigar and devot- </p><p>ing both hands to the unwrapping of the </p><p>The Dragon’s Claw </p><p>149 </p><p>package. “A little over an hour, I should </p><p>say. I-”	—</p><p> His voice died away in an inarticulate</p><p>choking that made McNeill, half-way to the </p><p>door, turn and regard him sharply. Rems- </p><p>den’s face was blotched, his jaw sagged, </p><p>his pop-eyes seemed actually starting from </p><p>their sockets and they were lit with a horror </p><p>that showed in his mottled, shaking jowls </p><p>and the trembling hands which were </p><p>still suspended above the box that he had </p><p>opened. </p><p> McNeill crossed to him, picked up the box</p><p>and shook out the objects it contained on </p><p>a newspaper that Remsden had been read- </p><p>ing. A scrap of paper closely covered with </p><p>small, beautifully written Chinese script </p><p>fluttered after them. Remsden stared, </p><p>still incapable of action, fascinated by the </p><p>^grisly things before him. </p><p> These were the half-desiccated lips, ears</p><p>and eyelids of a man, the black lashes, </p><p>gummy with dried blood, still clung to the </p><p>latter. </p><p> “What—what?” he muttered as McNeill</p><p>rapidly translated the script. </p><p> With his eyes, his lips, his ears, he betrayed.</p><p> Now can Fung-Ti neither see wrong, nor speak</p><p>falsely nor listen to the voice of the white devil who </p><p>bribes. </p><p> “Fung-Ti?” muttered Remsden and</p><p>looked up at McNeill who towered over </p><p>him menacingly, the scrap of paper in his </p><p>hands quivering. </p><p> “Do you know what the rest of this</p><p>says?” demanded McNeill. “Listen! </p><p> These are the lips and eyelids and the outer ears</p><p>of Fung-Ti, the false priest, the thief, the betrayer. </p><p> Within ten days restore the sacred relic or, what</p><p>has happened to Fung-Ti, who still lives but prays to </p><p>the gods he has betrayed that he may die, shall hap- </p><p>pen to the white woman who returns to the shrine of </p><p>Hoang Lung as hostage. </p><p> First did we test Fung-Ti with the ordeal of the</p><p>Rrazen Serpent. Then did we sever the false mem- </p><p>bers we send to you. It would he hard to tell now </p><p>that Fung-Ti was once a man. Yet he lives. </p><p> The limbs of the white woman are far more frail</p><p>than those of Fung-Ti. They will shrink and shrivel </p><p>in the twist of the Bronze Serpent. </p><p> Ten days we give you. Return the holy relic,</p><p>and the girl shall be delivered to the messenger. </p><p>Fail, and not only shall the girl die many deaths but </p><p>thou and the man who was with thee shall know the </p><p>vengeance of the Hoang Lung though ye hide in </p><p>caverns at the bottom of the sea. </p><p> See that ye do this sccretly. For, if ye appeal to</p><p>the governments or speak to any that the Shrine of </p><p>Hoang Lung has been dishonored, in that same hour </p><p>shall ye all die.” </p><p>SO MENACING was the look with </p><p>which McNeill regarded Remsden </p><p>that the latter threw up his shaking </p><p>hands in a semblance of defense. </p><p> “For the love of God, Neill!” he whim-</p><p>pered. </p><p> “Stop your blasphemy,” said the Irish-</p><p>man. “Do you know what the Brazen </p><p>Serpent means, Remsden? They twine </p><p>copper tubes about your legs and arms and </p><p>waist and then they fill the tubes with </p><p>boiling water. That is what they threaten </p><p>to do to-” </p><p> He struck the heavy table such a smash</p><p>with his doubled fist that the panel split </p><p>and the horrible bits of Fung Ti danced </p><p>on the paper. “Out with that relic, </p><p>Remsden! Out with it!” he demanded. </p><p>“They have got Helen! Give it to me so I </p><p>can go after her!” </p><p> “Ten days, they said—ten days. The</p><p>shrine is only five days’ journey.” </p><p> McNeill gripped Remsden by the shoul-</p><p>ders and, heavy as he was, shook him as a </p><p>terrier would shake a rat. </p><p> “You would temporize with the girl’s</p><p>safety?” he cried. “I’ll tell you this, </p><p>Remsden. If one hair of her head has been </p><p>harmed when I return—and I shall return— </p><p>I will make you wish you had been Fung-Ti. </p><p>Where is this relic?”</p><p> “Wait,” said Remsden, shrinking into</p><p>his chair on his release but with his face </p><p>sullen with the piggish obstinacy he could </p><p>assume. I can not give it to you. I </p><p>haven’t got it. I can’t get it again before </p><p>forty-eight hours. There will be plenty </p><p>of time.” </p><p> “Remsden, you lied to me before in the</p><p>cave. You are lying now.” </p><p> “I did not lie to you. I said that you</p><p>might search me. I did not have it with </p><p>me. Helen had it then, though she did not </p><p>know it. It was in my wallet. I told her it </p><p>bothered me in riding, and she carried it.” </p><p>McNeill’s utter loathing pierced even </p><p>Remsden’s armor. </p><p> “I am not lying now,” he asserted dog-</p><p>gedly. “I may be able to get it back a </p><p>little sooner than forty-eight hours. But </p><p>I haven’t it and that’s the flat truth.” </p><p>McNeill, his eyes burning within a few </p><p>inches of the other’s, told himself that </p><p>Remsden was telling the truth. </p><p> “I am going to give you just twenty-four</p><p>hours to produce it,” he said. “During that </p><p>time I am going to make preparations that </p><p>150 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>will insure the safety of Miss Helen. If </p><p>you haven’t got it back by then you are </p><p>going to be a very unhappy man for the rest </p><p>of your life. You are not my employer in </p><p>this matter; you couldn’t hire me with </p><p>your money to go back. I am going on my </p><p>own account. You can pay me what you </p><p>do owe me, however, as I shall need imme- </p><p>diate cash.” </p><p> Remsden detached certain travellers’</p><p>checks from their sheaf and passed them </p><p>over to McNeill. </p><p> “It is no use threatening me,” he said.</p><p> “I will get it as soon as I can—not later than</p><p> forty-eight hours. That gives us a margin</p><p> of three days. They will not injure her.”</p><p> “What is this relic?” demanded the</p><p> younger man.</p><p> Remsden’s eyes glowed. He seemed to</p><p>recover his self-assurance. The man was </p><p>a trifle mad, with the frenzy of a collector, </p><p>McNeill decided, as Remsden poured him- </p><p>self some whisky and tossed it down with a </p><p>hand not yet stead)'. </p><p> “What do you know about Chinese</p><p>mythology, Neill?” he asked. </p><p> “Not very much.”</p><p> McNeill resented the smug manner of</p><p>Remsden’s speech but he was anxious to </p><p>leam what he could about the relic. </p><p> “Ah! Perhaps you know that they be-</p><p>lieve that originally the land was ruled by </p><p>the dragon kings, lords of air, land and </p><p>sea?” </p><p> McNeill nodded.</p><p> “Well, in the holy shrine of Hoang Lung</p><p> is supposed to be kept an actual claw of the</p><p> last of the dragon kings—a claw set in</p><p> gray jade carved to represent the sheath</p><p> of the claw and also inscribed with runes</p><p> that even the great Lao T’se could not</p><p> interpret. This claw is probably that of a</p><p> great cave-bear; it is of non-retractile type.</p><p> It is evidently very old. It might even</p><p> have come from some monster of prehistoric</p><p> times. The point is that it is believed</p><p> indubitably to be the claw of the dragon,</p><p> and the temple of the Hoang Lung is wor-</p><p> shiped as its repository.”</p><p> “And you got it? How?”</p><p> Remsden almost beamed with self-satis-</p><p> -faction.</p><p> “I got up the expedition to the temple.</p><p> I am not a Mason but I have knowledge of</p><p> the ancient universal rituals and symbols</p><p> from which modern Masonry has borrowed.</p><p> They have been long known to the older</p><p>dynasties of ancient nations, China in- </p><p>cluded. Through their use I was received </p><p>by the priests, as you know, and observed </p><p>their ritual, something but one other white </p><p>man has ever done. I noted that the claw </p><p>was not a myth. Fung-Ti did the rest </p><p>for a very large sum of money that was </p><p>packed in the box carried by the smaller </p><p>camel, the box you, with all the rest, </p><p>thought carried cartridges.” </p><p> “I thought some one had stolen that,”</p><p>said McNeill under his breath. </p><p> “Just how Fung-Ti accomplished the</p><p>theft I do not know. I left the particulars </p><p>to him. He has been frightfully punished, </p><p>but he knew his risk. Under ordinary </p><p>circumstances nothing would have been </p><p>discovered for a full month, by which time </p><p>Fung Ti would have been far away, had it </p><p>not been for that shower of shooting stars </p><p>the night after we left the temple. The </p><p>priests of Hoang Lung imagine such phe- </p><p>nomena the golden scales shaken from the </p><p>dragon gods in anger, and I suppose they </p><p>investigated. It was an unfortunate coin- </p><p>cidence. </p><p> “The claw was without doubt the most</p><p>wonderful curio in the world. It would </p><p>have brought me fortune. I preferred </p><p>fame. Now I have lost both,” he sighed. </p><p> McNeill regarded him keenly. The sigh</p><p>hardly seemed genuine, but he was deter- </p><p>mined that Remsden should not leave his </p><p>sight until the relic reappeared from wher- </p><p>ever it had been deposited. That Remsden </p><p>should have let it leave him for a moment </p><p>seemed incredible, but he was certain that </p><p>in that matter the collector had not lied. </p><p>For the rest he was an incipient lunatic so</p><p>far as curios were concerned. </p><p> “I want you to go out with me for a</p><p>while,” said McNeill. “And I shall take </p><p>the connecting room to this suite.” </p><p> “Where are we going?”</p><p> “To pass the word to certain men that I</p><p>know,” said McNeill. “I am going on this </p><p>return trip with an escort of he-men, Mr. </p><p>Remsden. I take it you would prefer to </p><p>stay in Peking. I should recommend the </p><p>embassy after we have gone, if they will </p><p>shelter you. Come on!” His tone was </p><p>that of sheriff to his prisoner. For a half </p><p>moment Remsden rebelled. </p><p> “Very well,” he said at last. “Anymore</p><p>ftmds that are necessary?” </p><p> “If I run short I’ll borrow some from</p><p>you,” snapped McNeill. “Come on!” </p><p>V </p><p>The Dragon’s Claw </p><p>! jS^.1 THIRTY-SIX hours later McNeill </p><p>seated in his room next to that of </p><p>K.aiJ Remsden whom he could hear im- </p><p>patiently padding up and down, listened </p><p>to a knock on Remsden’s door and to </p><p>Remsden opening it. Some one who talked </p><p>in a voice of high pitch that was almost </p><p>instantaneously hushed to a whisper, was </p><p>admitted. McNeill rose and softly opened </p><p>his own door to the corridor. Presently </p><p>he heard the chink of gold and Remsden’s </p><p>door reopening. </p><p> He gilded to where his own entrance stood</p><p>ajar, the light out in his room, and saw, </p><p>gliding along the passage, the bowed form </p><p>of an old Chinaman who was stowing away </p><p>something in his capacious blouse. The face </p><p>of wrinkled yellow skin, drawn tight as a </p><p>drumhead over the skull, showed little, but </p><p>the eyes, looking furtively from left to </p><p>right, held the look of one who gloats over </p><p>greed satisfied and is yet possessed with </p><p>deadly fear. </p><p> Moreover, McNeill recognized the man</p><p>as the master-craftsman of all Peking’s </p><p>artificers in precious metals and gems, in </p><p>pearl and ivo/y—Ling Yuan, the greatest </p><p>connoisseur of all the Orient in such works </p><p>of art. </p><p> It seemed evident to him where the claw</p><p>had been. For some reason Remsden had </p><p>consulted Ling Yuan as to the authenticity </p><p>of the claw, fearing perhaps that Fung-Ti </p><p>had played him false, though the awful </p><p>mementoes of that false priest had since </p><p>furnished mute proof of his having really </p><p>obtained the actual relic. Wondering a </p><p>little what enormous sum Remsden must </p><p>have demanded from Ling Yuan as pledge </p><p>for the return of the claw, McNeill turned </p><p>on his light and closed the barely opened </p><p>door without noise. The next instant </p><p>Remsden appeared in the entrance between </p><p>the rooms. </p><p> “I have the claw,” he said. “Take it,</p><p>Neill, and save Helen.” </p><p> McNeill took it—a little thing to repre-</p><p>sent the burning, mystical faith of the most </p><p>mysterious nation of the world. The claw </p><p>itself was black with age, and far longer than</p><p>that of any animal that Neill had ever seen, </p><p>sharply curved, set in gray translucent jade </p><p>which was scaled where it gripped the claw </p><p>and, above that, deep cut with hieroglyphs. </p><p>He opened his belt and shirt and put </p><p>the thing away in a pocket of his money </p><p>belt. </p><p> “I shall find a better place for it pres-</p><p>ently,” he said. </p><p> Remsden sighed as he saw it disappear.</p><p> “It was a costly experiment,” he said.</p><p>“How early do you start?” </p><p> “Immediately,” said McNeill. “There is</p><p>not a moment to lose. We shall travel fast, </p><p>but there may be delays. My men are </p><p>waiting for me now.” </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>OCCIDENT AGAINST ORIENT </p><p>THE temple of the Hoang Lung, the </p><p>Shrine of the Dragon’s Claw, lies in a </p><p>natural amphitheater, the buildings of stone </p><p>and sun-dried brick standing in a horseshoe </p><p>of steep hills that are honeycombed with </p><p>caves and fissures, some of which are used as </p><p>dwellings for the priests. The entrance to </p><p>the horseshoe is winged across with stone </p><p>walls that connect with high arches, also </p><p>of stone and carved with weird representa- </p><p>tions of the dragon gods and their lesser </p><p>attendant divinities. </p><p> There are three of these arches and they</p><p>were undoubtedly built to serve as defenses </p><p>against marauders from the north. They </p><p>were built many hundreds of years ago, </p><p>perliaps thousands, and their carvings are </p><p>smudged with the rasp of wind and rain and </p><p>desert sands, and there are deep interstices </p><p>where once the stone blocks met with exact </p><p>precision. </p><p> A modern field gun would knock one to</p><p>pieces in two shots; yet, inasmuch as field </p><p>guns have never neared the shrine, they are </p><p>still considered, in the light of legend and </p><p>dim history, impregnable when the wooden </p><p>gates, reinforced heavily with metal, are </p><p>closed. </p><p> At nightfall of the fifth day after their</p><p>start from Peking, the seventh since the ul-</p><p>timatum of the priests had been delivered </p><p>to Remsden, a party -of white men were </p><p>camped in the hills some three miles from </p><p>the town and temple of Hoang Lung. By </p><p>the light of the fire about which they sat </p><p>at a war-council with their pipes or ciga- </p><p>rets going, they were a hard-bitten, lean </p><p>and capable looking crowd, eighteen of </p><p>them in all—volunteers under McNeill to </p><p>get a white girl out of Hoang Lung. </p><p> Engineers, prospectors, adventurers of</p><p>sorts they were and all were known to Mc- </p><p>Neill personally. They represented every </p><p>152 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>loose and available white man in Peking or </p><p>its vicinity who could get away for such a </p><p>trip. Their ages varied from twenty-two </p><p>to fifty, and they were all as hard as nails. </p><p>Every one of them knew how to handle a </p><p>gun and was not afraid to do so. Better, </p><p>they knew when not to do so. </p><p> McNeill stood apart in talk with a</p><p>bearded man who had built many miles of </p><p>railroad in interior China only to see his </p><p>work undone by fanatic hordes, urged on by </p><p>the priests. Neill’s field-glasses were slung </p><p>at his sides, and he unbuckled the case and </p><p>took them out. </p><p> “The moon’ll be up in a few minutes,</p><p>Wilson,” he said. “It’s lightening over the </p><p>eastern ridge now. Canfield and I are going </p><p>in alone on foot as soon as it rises. After </p><p>we’ve fixed things at the first arch we’ll </p><p>camp in one of the caves. I’ll go in soon </p><p>after dawn—alone.” </p><p> “It seems foolhardy to do that, Neill,”</p><p>said Wilson. “Wouldn’t at least a display </p><p>of force help out? Of course you’re run- </p><p>ning this show.” </p><p> “I’ve gone over it very carefully,” said</p><p>McNeill. “I’ve got to make the play single- </p><p>handed. At eight o’clock, if they are not </p><p>coming through, you know what to expect. </p><p>If I don’t show up here by nine, or you don’t </p><p>see me coming, then you take command and </p><p>do whatever you think best, not forgetting </p><p>that it is more than probable that Miss </p><p>Remsden and myself will be past doing for. </p><p> “Here comes the moon. Now then, take</p><p>the glasses and look about sou’-west-by- </p><p>sou’. There are parallel ridges leading in </p><p>that general direction and Canfield and I </p><p>will keep the valleys, though I don’t think </p><p>there is much fear of a lookout. They are </p><p>expecting us, no doubt, but it is our move </p><p>and they are not likely to be worrying about </p><p>it. We are three days t'o the good. You </p><p>can use the ridges for cover tomorrow if </p><p>things go wrong with me.” </p><p> Wilson, the glasses to his eyes, only</p><p>grunted. The arches, particularly the first </p><p>one, were plain to see, their stones silvered </p><p>by the moon, now clear of the ridge.</p><p> “ ’S up to you,” said Wilson at last,</p><p>“till eight o’clock tomorrow. Then it’s up </p><p>to me. Goin’ to take horses?” </p><p> “No. Less noise, less risk. We can pack</p><p>all we need easily enough. A good deal </p><p>depends on getting our work done abso- </p><p>lutely unobserved.” </p><p> “If you don’t come back,” said Wilson</p><p>gruffly, “or if they’ve done anything to that </p><p>girl, I’m telling you one thing, McNeill, </p><p>before noon tomorrow the inhabitants of </p><p>Hoang Lung are going to think hell, or </p><p>whatever their heathen equivalent for </p><p>Gehenna is, has opened under their feet. </p><p>We’ve got the stuff to do it with and we’ve </p><p>got the boys who know how to use it.” </p><p> They walked back to the rest of the expe-</p><p>dition in silence. McNeill had deliber- </p><p>ately shut off from his mental vision all </p><p>thoughts of what might have happened to </p><p>Helen Remsden. Suggestions of bronze </p><p>tubes filled with boiling water and twisted </p><p>around her dainty limbs, thoughts of </p><p>all the fantastic refinements of devilish </p><p>torture that might be practised upon her, he </p><p>deliberately dismissed as unnerving and </p><p>destructive to the job in hand. </p><p> He did not trust the priests. Once they</p><p>had obtained the claw, they would be likely </p><p>to endeavor to get revenge on those who had </p><p>had any hand in the defilement of the sacred </p><p>relic. He had laid plans accordingly. </p><p> Canfield came forward to meet them, the</p><p>youngest of the troop, a man absolutely </p><p>reckless, once given his head, but possessing </p><p>the rare quality of being able to take orders </p><p>from a man he acknowledged capable of </p><p>giving them. </p><p> “Ready to go, McNeill?” he asked.</p><p> “If you are.”</p><p> “Righto,” returned Canfield, Britisher</p><p>and younger son. “Got all my little duds </p><p>packed for the picnic.” </p><p> “Then we’re off,” announced McNeill.</p><p> The talk stopped, pipes and cigarets</p><p>were taken briefly from mouths that</p><p>quietly wished “good night” and “good </p><p>luck,” and the two started on their hike. </p><p>AN HOUR and a half later two </p><p>figures glided away from the dark </p><p>shadow of the first arch and, blend- </p><p>ing in the inequalities of the cliff face, after </p><p>they had passed the length of the stone </p><p>wall in a low crouch, carefully paying out a </p><p>thin thread as they went, disappeared in a </p><p>niche where the face of the precipice had </p><p>warped apart. There they compared </p><p>watches carefully. </p><p> “We’ll check again in the morning, Can-</p><p>field,” said McNeill. “I want to pull this </p><p>thing off to the second, if possible. It’s </p><p>three o’clock now. These priests are a lazy </p><p>crowd. I won’t start until seven and even </p><p>then they won’t be stirring. That gives </p><p>The Dragon’s Claw </p><p>153 </p><p>us four hours—two apiece for sleep. I’ll </p><p>take the first watch.” </p><p> “You’re on,” said Canfield and curled up</p><p>in the crevice like a tired dog. </p><p> At seven o’clock McNeill left the little</p><p>fissure and descended unnoticed to the flat </p><p>ground in front of the first arch. There was </p><p>no sound of gong, no sign of life within the </p><p>enclosure. The gates were shut, and he </p><p>knew the frowsy sentinel slept inside. The </p><p>holy priests of Hoang Lung were not ascet- </p><p>ics. So far as they could obtain it, they </p><p>lived upon the fat of the land and denied </p><p>themselves nothing, and, by virtue of the </p><p>claw, their tribute was universal and </p><p>munificent. </p><p> At fifteen minutes after seven McNeill</p><p>took a whistle from his pocket and blew on </p><p>it shrilly. A wicket in the upper leaf of one </p><p>gate was drawn back, and the sleepy eyes </p><p>of a watchman peered out, widened as they </p><p>saw the solitary white devil, and suddenly </p><p>disappeared. </p><p> It was fifteen minutes more before the</p><p>gates were opened and a group of yellow- </p><p>robed and shaven priests appeared, escorted </p><p>by a score of so-called soldiery, armed with a </p><p>nondescript array of swords, wide-bladed </p><p>spears, muskets and rifles of all vintages. </p><p>In their midst McNeill walked through to </p><p>the inner courtyard. </p><p> A short, fat priest advanced. He was</p><p>ancient. His avoirdupois spoke eloquently </p><p>of self-indulgence, and his face, projecting </p><p>from the draped hood that puffed about his </p><p>full neck, held no more expression than that </p><p>of a turtle. The small eyes showed merely </p><p>life, no more emotion than if they had been </p><p>insets of jet. </p><p> "Tao Chan?” asked McNeill.</p><p> This had been the name of the writer of</p><p>the letter to Remsden, the name of the head </p><p>priest of Hoang Lung. </p><p> Tao Chan acknowledged the dignity.</p><p>“You have brought back the claw?” he </p><p>demanded. </p><p> "Is the hostage safe?” parried McNeill.</p><p>“To talk in questions is to waste time,” </p><p>replied the priest. “First answer me.” </p><p> “I can make delivery of the claw.”</p><p> "The girl is unharmed.”</p><p> “Then show her to me.”</p><p> “Show me the claw.”</p><p> McNeill laughed, and a red light came</p><p>into the jetty eyes of Tao Chan. </p><p> “It is not wise to make a mock of the</p><p>guardian of the claw,” he said. </p><p> “It is not wise to take a white man for a</p><p>fool, O guardian that has no claw to guard,” </p><p>answered McNeill. “Show me the girl!” </p><p> There had been no apparent sign, but the</p><p>priests fell back and the guards edged in </p><p>toward the Irishman. </p><p> “Touch me and I destroy your temple,”</p><p>he said confidently. </p><p> It was Tao Chan’s turn to laugh, but</p><p>a grin was the nearest he could come to it. </p><p> “You speak boldly,” he sneered.</p><p> McNeill was gaging his time, looking</p><p>covertly at the hands of his wrist-watch. </p><p> “The bargain was to exchange the girl for</p><p>the claw,” he said. “You know I must be </p><p>able to produce the claw or I would not. </p><p>have traveled so far. I must know that </p><p>you can produce the girl.” </p><p> Tao Chan’s immutable face gave no sign,</p><p>and McNeill’s heart sank, then rose again. </p><p>If they had injured her? To them the life </p><p>of a white maiden, save as they could use it </p><p>for torture, was nothing. He tried a lead on </p><p>this line. </p><p> “Also there are many thousands of white</p><p>maidens, O Tao Chan, and but one </p><p>claw.” </p><p> “There is but one maiden for thee, white</p><p>man.” </p><p> “And yet there are thousands, aye mil-</p><p>lions, who hold thee responsible for the </p><p>claw,” challenged McNeill. “If I return </p><p>not with the girl in safety, all China will </p><p>know how. Tao Chan has been outwitted by </p><p>the foreign devils, and I do not think what </p><p>is left of thy life will be happy. Show me </p><p>the girl.” </p><p> Still no visible sign, but the guards inched</p><p>in. It seemed clear to McNeill that the </p><p>whole thing had been planned before the </p><p>gate was opened. They meant to get the </p><p>claw and wreak their vengeance on McNeill </p><p>and the girl, if she was not already sacrificed. </p><p>He looked at his watch. It was five </p><p>minutes of the hour. </p><p> “I have warned you,” he said. “Do you</p><p>think I was fool enough to come here alone </p><p>with the claw upon me? There are yet </p><p>three days within which to deliver it. It is </p><p>not far from here but in a place where you </p><p>can never find it. First I must know </p><p>whether you can keep your side of the </p><p>bargain. Show me the girl.” </p><p> “I think you can be made to tell where the</p><p>claw is,” said Tao Chan softly. </p><p> “I do not know where it is,” said McNeill.</p><p>“So I can not tell you.” </p><p>154 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> He spoke with such utter conviction that</p><p>Tao Chan’s face twitched. He believed </p><p>that the foreign devil might be telling the </p><p>truth. He gave an order. It was repeated </p><p>back to where guards lounged on the steps of </p><p>the quaintly-roofed temple. The lacquered </p><p>doors opened, and the figure of Helen Rems- </p><p>den appeared between two priests, who </p><p>stepped back a little from her. She gave a </p><p>little cry, and McNeill, whimsically conscious </p><p>of the incongruity of the action, took off his </p><p>helmet Then the doors closed again. </p><p> “We shall not torture you the first,” said</p><p>Tao Chan very quietly. “First you shall </p><p>watch us work with the girl. After that </p><p>you may not care to live. But we shall give </p><p>you certain chances from time to time to </p><p>bring in the claw. You foreign devil,” he </p><p>continued almost in a monotone that </p><p>threatened the more with its repression, </p><p>“did you think you could ravish the shrine </p><p>of the dragon god and go unscathed? </p><p>Fung-Ti has been punished. So shall all </p><p>the rest of you be punished. Your prayers </p><p>for pity shall lack lips to utter them.” </p><p> “Touch me,” said McNeill, “and I shall</p><p>shoot you through the belly, Tao Chan. </p><p>Just one tiny touch—I have you covered </p><p>now from my pocket—and you will be ex- </p><p>plaining to your gods why you could not </p><p>keep their claw. I give you one chance. </p><p>Tell your men to fall back, bring out th** </p><p>girl in a palanquin borne by four priests. </p><p>You and four more shall accompany me to </p><p>the spot where the claw will be turned over </p><p>to you. Will you do this?” </p><p> For the last few seconds marked by the</p><p>march of the hands on McNeill’s watch, the </p><p>two men, Occidetal and Oriental, held a </p><p>duel of glances. </p><p>K'^^IN THE fissure Canfield stooped </p><p>f •p""above a little instrument of polished </p><p>rj^kli^wood and brass. For fifteen min- </p><p>utes he had been expecting to hear Mc- </p><p>Neill’s whistle. Now he knew that the </p><p>little lesson they had arranged was to be </p><p>given, and he glanced at his own watch and </p><p>looked over his adjustments with nerveless </p><p>thoroughness. </p><p> “No,” bluffed the high-priest.</p><p> Back of them there was a muffled roar, a</p><p>swift suggestion of exploding gases, a cloud </p><p>of smoke that mushroomed, in which frag- </p><p>ments of masonry lofted and rushed down </p><p>again while the outer arch crumbled and </p><p>dissolved before the eyes of Hoang Lung. </p><p> McNeill had not moved a muscle. Now</p><p>he put the question again. </p><p> “Will you do this? Or shall I destroy</p><p>the shrine?” </p><p> Tao Chan thought rapidly. He guessed</p><p>somewhat of the means employed to level </p><p>the arch. But it had been done very </p><p>cleverly, and he could not offset the terror of </p><p>his ignorant underlings by a talk on dyna- </p><p>mite. To them it was all magic. McNeill </p><p>seemed very confident, and Tao Chan felt </p><p>that the white man might use more of </p><p>this magic wisdom to carry out his </p><p>threat. True, the girl was in lie Temple, </p><p>but- </p><p> He looked at his panic-stricken guards,</p><p>at the uneasiness of his priests, trained as </p><p>they were to avoid emotion, and he looked </p><p>at McNeill, jaunty, nonchalant, all save his </p><p>eyes, which were bits of steel. The white </p><p>devil might sacrifice the girl. They did </p><p>such things when they were desperate, to </p><p>save them from torture. The claw must </p><p>come back. He metaphorically tossed in </p><p>his cards. He was still qualmish in the </p><p>stomach that McNeill had threatened. </p><p> Once more he gave an order, whereupon</p><p>McNeill whipped out his whistle and </p><p>sounded it twice. </p><p> Canfield picked up his battery and con-</p><p>nections and strolled out of his cave. </p><p> “Worked like a charm,” he said to the</p><p>lizards that flickered before him. “A little </p><p>bit of all right, that.” </p><p>A BAFFLED mob clustered about </p><p>the ruins of the outer arch and </p><p>sullenly watched the palanquin borne </p><p>by the priests depart under the command of </p><p>the two white devils. </p><p> McNeill and Canfield walked one on either</p><p>side of the chair and talked through the </p><p>drawn curtains of elaborately embroidered</p><p>silk to the rescued Helen Remsden. McNeill </p><p>and Helen did most of the talking, Canfield </p><p>noticed, and, being a goods sport, he filled </p><p>in the time smoking cigarets. </p><p> So they came to the camp in the hills,</p><p>traveling the crest of the ridge, despite the </p><p>sun, for McNeill wanted to make sure they </p><p>were not followed. Amid the ring of men </p><p>the priests set down the palanquin. </p><p> “Now,” demanded Tao Chan as the</p><p>girl stepped out, “I have kept faith. </p><p>Where is the claw?” </p><p> “What did you do with it, Wilson?” asked</p><p>McNeill. “I told our bloated friend here </p><p>The Dragon’s Claw </p><p>that I did not know where it was, but he </p><p>would not believe me.” </p><p> Tao Chan, not knowing the language of</p><p>the foreign devils, glowered at them sus- </p><p>piciously. </p><p> ‘‘The white men also keep faith, Tao</p><p>Chan,” said McNeill. “Give it to him, </p><p>Wilson.” </p><p> The bearded man solemnly uttered a</p><p>jargon of meaningless syllables. He was in </p><p>his rolled-up shirt-sleeves and he exposed his </p><p>open hands back and front to Tao Chan and </p><p>the priests. </p><p> “Can ye not see it?” he asked, speaking</p><p>fluently the vernacular. “It was hidden in </p><p>the air. Lord of air and land and water and </p><p>of fire was the dragon king. He did but </p><p>return the claw to its own and now, in </p><p>promise kept, we bring it back again. </p><p>Behold!” </p><p> He pointed to a spot just above the level</p><p>of the wondering eyes of the priests. Then, </p><p>between the thumb and forefinger of the </p><p>other hand, suddenly appeared, by clever </p><p>legerdemain, the claw. </p><p> A cry camc simultaneously from the</p><p>priests and all, save Tao Chan, dropped on </p><p>hands and knees in obeisance. But Tao </p><p>Chans who could do some pretty conjuring </p><p>himself upon occasion, frowned and took </p><p>the relic. From his robe he produced a </p><p>case of carven jade lined with golden </p><p>silk, and reverently placed the claw </p><p>within. </p><p> As the priests rose to his order they found</p><p>^hemselves covered by the pistols of the </p><p>expedition. </p><p> “You are going to take a little walk with</p><p>us as far as the bamboo bridge across the </p><p>Wu-liang chasm,” announced McNeill. </p><p>“To the other side of it, in fact. Then </p><p>we’ll say good-by and leave you with the </p><p>claw—after we have destroyed the bridge. </p><p>Doubtless you will find some roundabout </p><p>way to get back to Hoang Lung. Do you </p><p>want to ride in the palanquin, Miss Helen, </p><p>or would you rather have a horse? We </p><p>brought a spare one for you.” </p><p> “A horse, please,” said the girl. “I</p><p>haven’t been treated at all badly, Mr. </p><p>McNeill, but the sooner I can get away </p><p>from everything Chinese the better I shall </p><p>be suited.” </p><p> McNeill translated to Tao Chan, into</p><p>whose face came the suggestion of satisfac- </p><p>tion. He appropriated the abandoned pa- </p><p>lanquin to his own uses, and from there to </p><p>the bridge the priests spelled each other in </p><p>carrying his redundancy. </p><p> It did not take the little corps of experts</p><p>long to destroy utterly the bridge of heavy </p><p>bamboos, ingeniously cantilevered by the </p><p>Chinese across the deep split, and then they </p><p>left the discomfited Tao Chan to lead his </p><p>men back to Hoang Lung as best he could. </p><p>Straight for Peking they headed, well </p><p>mounted, exuberant, losing no time. </p><p> Helen Remsden told them the details of</p><p>her carrying off. As McNeill had sus- </p><p>pected—had practically known—there were </p><p>members of the Hoang Lung affiliated with </p><p>practically every bazaar in Peking, and, </p><p>when she had walked into the Rising Sun </p><p>Bazaar, she had walked into a trap that was </p><p>promptly sprung, a trap that was only one of </p><p>a long line set for her throughout the city. </p><p> “I wanted a mandarin coat or two,”</p><p>she said, “to take home for gifts. I thought </p><p>the Rising Sun, with almost always an </p><p>American or European customer at every </p><p>counter, was safe. Mr. Remsden said </p><p>nothing to the contrary. But, when I left </p><p>the hotel, I fancied a Chinaman who was </p><p>loafing about the compound noticed me </p><p>particularly and when I was in the Bazaar </p><p>I was almost certain that this same man </p><p>came in and spoke to one of the clerks. </p><p>This clerk spoke to the man serving me. </p><p> “I fancy I showed some suspicion, or</p><p>surprize, and it only shows how clever they </p><p>were, for the man who was waiting on me, </p><p>one of the principals of the Bazaar, I fancy, </p><p>who talked beautiful English, asked me al- </p><p>most instantly if I knew the man. I told </p><p>him that I did not know him but thought I </p><p>had seen him before at the hotel. </p><p> “He appeared to get very angry and told</p><p>me that the man wanted a commission on </p><p>anything I bought, claiming he had recom-</p><p>mended me to the Rising Sun. He rated </p><p>the man, who slunk out. I knew, of course, </p><p>that such a thing was very likely to happen, </p><p>and that almost every tourist purchase has </p><p>a squeeze or two behind the price. It </p><p>sounded a natural explanation and I </p><p>thought no more of it. </p><p> “I had especially asked for a pomegranate-</p><p>colored mandarin coat and they had noth- </p><p>ing of that shade, or near it, in the lot </p><p>brought me. Doubtless they took care </p><p>there was not. At all events, the man </p><p>seemed disturbed that he did not have one </p><p>to suit me and called out in Chinese. </p><p>After the answer he smiled and said that a </p><p>Adventure </p><p>consignment from Sze-Chuan province had </p><p>just arrived and was being unpacked and </p><p>priced. Would I come and see them as </p><p>they came out of the bale, and take my </p><p>pick? </p><p> “I went into a room at the back of the</p><p>place. As I passed through the door some- </p><p>thing was clapped to my face, a cloth </p><p>saturated in some pungent drug, and that </p><p>was all I knew until I found myself inside a </p><p>stuffy palanquin on camel-back, crossing </p><p>the desert. </p><p> “The rest you may imagine. I was fairly</p><p>well treated and I knew that Mr. Remsden </p><p>would arrange for my release. I thought— </p><p>I hoped,” she added, a little shyly, “that he </p><p>would send you, Mr. McNeill.” </p><p> McNeill, remembering how he had</p><p>handled Remsden in the matter, smiled a </p><p>bit grimly. </p><p>THEY were traversing a little rocky </p><p>defile that led down to the Chang </p><p>Li stream when a horseman ap- </p><p>proached them. The diminutive pony was </p><p>being pushed to its top speed by a China- </p><p>man who swayed in his saddle from weari- </p><p>ness. When they came up to him, for he </p><p>could not avoid them in the rocky pass, they </p><p>saw he was an old man, far too ancient to </p><p>be attempting such a ride without escort. </p><p> He rode his pony to one side along the slant</p><p>of the piled-up talus of the ravine, staring </p><p>at the party half curiously, half furtively. </p><p>The sight of the girl on the horse seemed to </p><p>fascinate him. Then McNeill, who, with </p><p>Wilson, had been playing rear-guard from </p><p>a possible pursuit and suqjrize, came gal- </p><p>loping up and the Chinaman shrank on his </p><p>saddle to a mere bundle of clothes, hiding </p><p>his mummy face by pulling down the folds </p><p>of the turban-like head-gear he wore against </p><p>the sim. </p><p> But McNeill had recognized him, though</p><p>he did not seek to detain him. It was Ling </p><p>Yuan, the connoisseur, the master-crafts- </p><p>man, the man he had seen in the corridor of </p><p>the Imperial, to whom Remsden had so </p><p>mysteriously entrusted the claw. In the </p><p>Chinaman’s face was the same mixture of </p><p>satisfied greed and furtive alarm. </p><p> “He’ll be a bit late with his news,”</p><p>thought McNeill and dismissed him from </p><p>his thoughts. </p><p> Next nightfall they rode through the out-</p><p>skirts of Peking, the cavalcade gradually </p><p>breaking up as they reached the foreign </p><p>quarter, only Wilson and Canfield riding </p><p>with McNeill and the girl through the arch- </p><p>way of the hotel courtyard. </p><p> McNeill dismounted, went in and came</p><p>out with the news. Remsden had, doubt- </p><p>less by cabled influence, obtained lodging at </p><p>the legation. His daughter was to join him </p><p>there and tomorrow they would start by </p><p>rail for Shanghai. </p><p> “That is bully,” said McNeill. “If I</p><p>remember right, you’ll just catch the </p><p>Cathay. We’ll see you to the legation.” </p><p>“Aren’t you going to stay there?” asked </p><p>the girl. “It’s just as dangerous for you.” </p><p>“I haven’t got the drag of Mr. Rems- </p><p>den,” smiled back McNeill. “I shall be safe </p><p>enough. The bunch of us will celebrate </p><p>our little expedition together. I shall see </p><p>you on the train tomorrow.” </p><p> “Then you are coming to Shanghai?”</p><p>Wilson in his wisdom had drawn Can- </p><p>field aside. </p><p> “I am going across to the States,” said</p><p>McNeill, “if I can get a spare plank to </p><p>bunk on. Bookings are heavy this time </p><p>of year. You—you have no objection to </p><p>my making the trip with you, Miss Helen?” </p><p>“What have I to do with it?” she chal- </p><p>lenged in sprightly fashion. Then her </p><p>lashes fell before something in his gaze. </p><p>“I owe everything to you, Mr. McNeill,” </p><p>she went on seriously. “My life—more </p><p>than that. I do not know how I can repay </p><p>you.” </p><p> “I do,” said McNeill. “I’ll tell you how</p><p>on the trip, perhaps.” </p><p> But the girl, however grateful, was not</p><p>to have her maidenly defenses overrun in </p><p>the first assault. </p><p> “It will be nice to have some one to talk</p><p>to,” she said. “But I thought that your </p><p>profession kept you in China, though I can </p><p>imagine that father’s folly may have jeop-</p><p>ardized your usefulness.” </p><p> “I am not a professional guide and in-</p><p>terpreter, if that is what you mean,” said </p><p>McNeill. “Only upon occasion. I have </p><p>made certain discoveries. I am going back </p><p>to San Francisco to exploit them. Person- </p><p>ally, I shall lie low in their development, </p><p>but I hold a main interest in several proj- </p><p>ects that promise well.” </p><p> “But you—Mr. Remsden thought that</p><p>you—” She broke off in charming con- </p><p>fusion as she sensed his reasons for acting </p><p>as guide to her stepfather. </p><p> “There were unusual reasons for my</p><p>The Dragon’s Claw </p><p>157 </p><p>attachment to your stepfather—and your- </p><p>self,” said McNeill. “Here is the legation </p><p>and there is Mr. Remsden. Good-by until </p><p>tomorrow.” </p><p> He raised his helmet as the girl turned</p><p>from greeting her father and waved her </p><p>hand to him. Then he joined Wilson and </p><p>Canfield, still discreetly in the background. </p><p> “I happen to know that old Chu Lee has</p><p>got some Pommery still stowed away,” he </p><p>said. “Let’s get the gang together and </p><p>celebrate.” </p><p> “Celebrate or congratulate?” drawled</p><p>Canfield. </p><p> “You pay for the champagne, Canfield,”</p><p>said McNeill imperturbably, “and you can </p><p>take your choice.” </p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>SING LEE, LAUNDRYMAN </p><p>THE Cathay was an American ship and, </p><p>aboard her, McNeill soon discovered </p><p>himself a comparative nonentity beside </p><p>Remsden. </p><p> The collector was not only rich but evi-</p><p>dently powerful by the deference shown </p><p>him at the legation and aboard the steamer. </p><p>No bribes of McNeill’s were able to get him </p><p>closer to Helen Remsden than six seats </p><p>away at the skipper’s table and Remsden </p><p>evidently was not disposed to encourage </p><p>communications between an Irish ad- </p><p>venturer whom he had employed as guide </p><p>and his stepdaughter, presumably his heiress. </p><p> He was courteous enough and liberal</p><p>enough with offers of reward that McNeill </p><p>refused,buthepooh-poohedgentlyMcNeill’s </p><p>allusions to his forthcoming exploitation of </p><p>certain discoveries. </p><p> “I hope you’ll make a go of it, Neill,”</p><p>he said. “Anything that I can do—but </p><p>you say you have the capital in sight. It’s </p><p>the concessions that are so doubtful. The </p><p>Chinese government is exceedingly un- </p><p>reliable and the various powers are envious </p><p>of each other in these matters. But I wish</p><p>you the best of luck.” </p><p> There was a sap-headed son of a million-</p><p>aire aboard who vied with several others </p><p>in paying attention to Helen, and to this </p><p>vapid specimen Remsden showed evident </p><p>favor, though McNeill believed Remsden </p><p>had better sense than to consider that </p><p>Helen would accept these attentions seri- </p><p>ously, or that Remsden would use the </p><p>young man for anything more than a cats- </p><p>paw—a convenient and time-serving barrier </p><p>against McNeill. Being free from the </p><p>Hoang Lung pursuit, as he evidently be- </p><p>lieved, Remsden had every intention of </p><p>shelving every one connected with it, in- </p><p>cluding McNeill. </p><p> He developed a slight illness that McNeill</p><p>shrewdly suspected was assumed and took </p><p>advantage of it to keep his stepdaughter </p><p>in close attendance upon him, with the </p><p>young millionaire as a willing aide. At </p><p>Honolulu he took the enamored youth </p><p>and Helen for a long ride during the wait </p><p>of the steamer, and McNeill whistled for a </p><p>chance alone with the girl. Moreover </p><p>the words of Remsden bore some weight. </p><p>McNeill had no right to court the girl </p><p>unless his future was assured instead of </p><p>merely being rosy-hued, as at present. </p><p> And so, in the rare moments when he</p><p>had the girl alone, he did not tell her, as </p><p>he had hinted at Peking, how she could </p><p>repay him for bringing her safely out of </p><p>danger. He was the last man to bid for </p><p>a girl’s love because he had done what </p><p>any red-blooded man would do for a girl </p><p>in peril. Mutual desire was the only thing </p><p>on which to base happiness, he decided. </p><p>If he could avow his love, backed by worldly </p><p>wealth to attend to all her comforts, and, </p><p>if she showed him his love might not be un- </p><p>acceptable, then he would put the matter </p><p>to the test. </p><p> Meanwhile he must attend to his own</p><p>affairs in San Francisco while they went to </p><p>New York by the first train, leaving four </p><p>hours after the Cathay docked. So, with </p><p>their New York address and a snapshot </p><p>taken 011 deck, he was reluctantly content. </p><p> But he did not fail to warn Remsden</p><p>that all danger might not be over. The </p><p>Chinese were clannish and the power of</p><p>the Hoang Lung reached wherever chop- </p><p>sticks were used and punksticks burned. </p><p>They had back their claw, but they had </p><p>been flouted. They might seek revenge. </p><p> “Poppycock, my dear Neill,” smiled</p><p>Remsden. “Not in America—not now- </p><p>adays. Even hatchetmen and tongs are </p><p>out of date. I appreciate your anxiety </p><p>for my health and that of my daughter, </p><p>but once in the United States I can well </p><p>take care of myself—and her. Good-by. </p><p>You must let me know how you come out </p><p>with your schemes. I may be able to help </p><p>you over some hitch—international politics, </p><p>158 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>you know. I am not without some in- </p><p>fluence in such things.” </p><p> Neill McNeill had a desire to tell Rems-</p><p>den just what he thought of his complacent </p><p>selfishness but he repressed it. The train </p><p>was starting and his opportunity for a </p><p>personal farewell was going a-glimmering </p><p>with Remsden’s purposeful chatter. The </p><p>vapid heir was going on the same train, </p><p>it seemed, and buzzing about Helen like </p><p>a hungry bee at sunset. The girl was not </p><p>of Remsden’s blood, McNeill thanked </p><p>Heaven. He did not think many ties </p><p>bound them save the one of duty on the </p><p>girl’s side, duty and a certain gratitude. </p><p>And so he deliberately shouldered aside </p><p>the scion of wealth and won his way to a </p><p>last handclasp. </p><p> “You will let me know how things go,</p><p>won’t you?” she asked, and there was balm </p><p>in the undoubted interest she expressed. </p><p>“You have our address and, perhaps, you </p><p>can make the communication personal?” </p><p>There was a suggestion of a blush and a </p><p>tightening grip of the hand as she said </p><p>this that recompensed Neill for the imme- </p><p>diate bustling up of Remsden and the </p><p>official remorselessness of the porter who </p><p>warned that the train “was just stahtin’.” </p><p>McNEILL took up his affairs in </p><p>earnest, registering at the Palace </p><p>and telephoning the members of his </p><p>syndicate for appointments in a determina- </p><p>tion to be in New York within the week. </p><p> Four days went by and he had the thing</p><p>well in hand. One man, who had been in </p><p>the southern part of the State, remained </p><p>to be seen, and the rest waited for that </p><p>person’s assent before going ahead with </p><p>the development. McNeill had explained </p><p>satisfactorily that he was persona non grata </p><p>with certain elements in China and his wish </p><p>not to superintend the comparatively </p><p>simple problems of exploitation \yas wil- </p><p>lingly granted by those to whom he was the </p><p>means of assured wealth. </p><p> “Fix it with Cox,” they told him at a</p><p>dinner at the Bohemian Club. “Convince </p><p>him—you’ve only to show him what you </p><p>showed us—and we’ll get to work with</p><p>the lawyers tomorrow.” </p><p> They were fine fellows, these Westerners,</p><p>and McNeill felt elated as he left them. </p><p>He went away early, for he had an appoint- </p><p>ment with Cox out at the latter’s big house </p><p>at San Mateo that evening. </p><p> As he swung briskly down town to the</p><p>Palace, where he had ordered a car to take </p><p>him down the peninsula, he fancied, as </p><p>he had fancied more than once in his four </p><p>days in San Francisco, that he was being </p><p>followed. Probably not by Chinamen, </p><p>for he had reflected that, if the Hoang Lung </p><p>had by cable got word across to their </p><p>affiliations on the coast, they would be </p><p>too subtle to use such palpable shadows. </p><p>There were many degraded white men, </p><p>chained to Chinese autocratic dispensers </p><p>of the drugs they craved, who would be </p><p>willing to play the spy. </p><p> It was only the working of a sixth sense</p><p>developed in the wilds, but McNeill, though </p><p>he could pick out no special person on the </p><p>busy streets, thought enough of the hunch </p><p>to slip an automatic in his pocket when </p><p>he took seat in the tonneau of the big car </p><p>that was soon gliding south to the fashion- </p><p>able suburb. </p><p> There were other cars on the road. Many</p><p>they overtook, but none passed them or </p><p>seemed to be trailing. Yet McNeill was </p><p>keenly alive to the fact that the fat priest </p><p>at Hoang Lung might smart for revenge </p><p>and impart that revenge to his proselytes </p><p>as a holy thing to be consummated. </p><p> He had warned Remsden. He had even</p><p>warned, more carefully, Helen. They were </p><p>safer in New York than he was in Cali- </p><p>fornia, but all three were still in jeopardy. </p><p>Presently the thing might die down, he </p><p>thought, as long as the claw had been </p><p>restored. Things changed rapidly in China. </p><p>A new government might frown on even </p><p>the priests of ancient religions who en- </p><p>dangered amicable relations by murdering </p><p>the subjects of a friendly and powerful </p><p>country from whom a new republic might </p><p>need favors. </p><p> For the present he would look out and,</p><p>when he got to New York, he would safe- </p><p>guard Helen as closely as she would permit. </p><p>McNeill had no fear of not convincing Cox</p><p>as to his proposition. Then there would </p><p>be a good sum coming to him immediately </p><p>and, with developments, he would be a </p><p>rich man. </p><p> As they crossed the San Mateo line a fog</p><p>began to thicken, but the driver was used </p><p>to fogs and the road; the lamps were power- </p><p>ful and they kept on their way, making </p><p>good progress, until finally they turned in </p><p>between high walls through iron gates and </p><p>rolled up to Cox’s ornate Italian villa. </p><p>The Dragon’s Claw </p><p>159 </p><p> McNeill could not have been received</p><p>more cordially by a member of his own </p><p>family, though this is not a good simile, </p><p>for McNeill was very much alone as far </p><p>as relatives went. His host’s hearty man- </p><p>ner, evident interest and keen appreciation </p><p>of his doings and their financial possi- </p><p>bilities soon put McNeill altogether at </p><p>ease with the world. Only one untoward </p><p>incident occurred to disturb two hours of </p><p>satisfactory business talk and establish- </p><p>ment of social relations. </p><p> Cox ordered refreshments. The butler</p><p>was a Chinaman. Cox’s menage was largely </p><p>Chinese, he explained, and eminently satis- </p><p>factory. As a butler the man was perfect— </p><p>silent, careful, deferential. Not once did </p><p>he seem to glance from beneath his smooth </p><p>crescent lids at master or guest while he </p><p>did his serving; but, as he left the room, </p><p>McNeill caught one oblique glance from </p><p>those sloe-black eyes directed at him </p><p>through the reflection of a mirror. The </p><p>eyes seemed to appraise, to check up, to </p><p>menace. </p><p> McNeill knew what strange tricks imagi-</p><p>nation plays when one allows any subject </p><p>of peculiar interest to one’s mental or </p><p>physical welfare to once become dominant. </p><p>Still he was glad to find the fog had lifted </p><p>when his car was ordered and he stepped </p><p>out into the quiet Californian night. Cox </p><p>pressed him hard to stay until the next </p><p>morning, when they would motor down </p><p>together and complete the negotiations </p><p>that would set McNeill free to go to New </p><p>York—and Helen. </p><p> But, with the absence of the fog, the</p><p>sense of danger seemed lessened. More- </p><p>over, if any was brewing, McNeill wanted </p><p>to see it through. It was late and the </p><p>driver started back at a good pace for the </p><p>city. In less than half a mile, however, </p><p>the engine began to stall and he got out </p><p>for investigation. They were on the main </p><p>road of the fairly populous suburb. On </p><p>either side were Summer villas standing </p><p>in considerable, well-tended grounds, be- </p><p>hind walls or hedges, as the owners’ fancy </p><p>chose. </p><p> The chauffeur tinkered and overhauled</p><p>and at last investigated the gasoline tank </p><p>in default of better explanation of their </p><p>trouble. He gave a sharp exclamation. </p><p> “Empty!” he said. “I told them to fill</p><p>it up at the garage. We ought to have six </p><p>or seven gallons and there ain’t a drop.” </p><p> “Did you see it filled?” asked McNeill.</p><p> “No, I didn’t. But they never bunked</p><p>me this way before.” </p><p> “What did you do while I was with Mr.</p><p>Cox?” </p><p> “Chewing the rag with his driver. They</p><p>got two touring cars and a big limousine. </p><p>He was in the butler’s pantry. He’s a </p><p>Chink but he sure treated me white. I </p><p>guess I’d better go back and get some gas </p><p>from Mr. Cox’s driver. He won’t be in </p><p>bed yet. Two or three gallons ’11 get this </p><p>boat in.”	. _</p><p> “All right,” said McNeill. “Hurry!” '</p><p> The man started down the road and he</p><p>watched him turn into the gates of the </p><p>villa. There were a few lights in the nearer </p><p>houses and the sound of music came from </p><p>one of them. It was all very quiet and </p><p>peaceful. </p><p>HTHEN, with a rush, they were on </p><p>him. Two figures hurled themselves </p><p>over the low wall to his right; he </p><p>heard the swift patter of footsteps from </p><p>behind as he stood at the rear of the car. </p><p>Instinctively he backed up to it and felt </p><p>for his pistol. The gun was gone. The </p><p>Chinese butler had helped him on with </p><p>his light coat and deftly lifted it. </p><p> The two assailants were coming for him,</p><p>head on. Even in the uncertain light he </p><p>felt sure they carried no weapons. Swiftly </p><p>he reached out his long, sinewy arms, </p><p>cupped a head in. either palm and brought </p><p>them together with a thud that dropped </p><p>the two senseless in the dust of the road. </p><p> Then something flickered about his neck</p><p>from behind. He knew what it was as it </p><p>tightened. Some one had climbed into </p><p>the tonneau and deftly slipped a bowstring </p><p>about his neck. The cord tightened and</p><p>sank into the flesh, beyond his power to </p><p>loosen. A red glare came before him and </p><p>he felt consciousness slipping away. </p><p> Then sudden relief, though he sagged to</p><p>the ground even as he sucked the air into </p><p>his tortured lungs. The glaring headlights </p><p>of a machine dazzled him as the oncoming </p><p>car jarred to a standstill a few feet away, </p><p>and two men jumped out and came toward </p><p>him. </p><p> “What’s up, old chap?” asked one of the</p><p>strangers, giving him a hand. </p><p> McNeill saw that the two whose heads</p><p>he had cracked had disappeared. So had </p><p>doubtless his other opponent. It was a </p><p>ibo </p><p>Adventure </p><p>close shave. Only for these two night birds, </p><p>who had obviously been celebrating, it </p><p>would have been all off with Neill McNeill. </p><p> “We ran out of gas,” he said, with some</p><p>difficulty, for the cord had bitten deeply. </p><p>“My man went back to the house there for a </p><p>supply and I had a touch of vertigo. I </p><p>haven’t been very well.” </p><p> “Vertigo? That’s a new name for it,</p><p>old pal,” said the second man. “I’ll have </p><p>to spring that on my wife. We thought </p><p>we saw a couple of chaps duck out, right </p><p>and left, as we came along and then we saw </p><p>you fall. Maybe we had vertigo our- </p><p>selves.” </p><p> McNeill summoned a laugh. He was</p><p>not inclined to give his confidence now </p><p>that he was well out of it. His driver was </p><p>coming back with the gasoline in a can. </p><p> “I’m all right now, anyway,” he said.</p><p>“Thanks, both of you. And here’s my </p><p>driver.” </p><p> The two got into their car and drove off</p><p>while the chauffeur replenished the tank. </p><p> “See anything of the butler?” asked</p><p>McNeill, as they got ready to start. </p><p> “Met him in the garden just now.</p><p>Taking a stroll with a bit of a dinky pipe. </p><p>Strange lot, them Chinks.” </p><p> “I thought I saw him myself,” said</p><p>McNeill. “If I didn’t, I felt him,” he </p><p>reflected and picked up from the seat </p><p>beside him a souvenir of the occasion. </p><p> It was a slender cord of Chinese silk,</p><p>flexible, singularly soft, but strong as </p><p>catgut and bright yellow. </p><p>CHAPTER VI </p><p>NEW YORK </p><p>N EILL McNEILL walked out of Grand </p><p>1 Central Station, scorning a taxicab. </p><p>The hotel could send for his baggage. With </p><p>all the fervor of one American born—New </p><p>York born, at that—who has been ex-</p><p>patriated for years in a barbaric kingdom, </p><p>he wanted to see, smell and taste New York. </p><p>He bought a paper but did not look at it. </p><p>People interested him more than news so </p><p>far. He was already wondering how soon </p><p>he could call upon the Remsdens—upon </p><p>Helen Remsden, to be exact. It was mid- </p><p>morning and he would have to wait until </p><p>afternoon he decided. But he could send </p><p>some flowers, and did. </p><p>He walked down Fifth Avenue to his </p><p>hotel, got his' room, washed up and went </p><p>out again on the streets. The unread </p><p>paper was still in his pocket. </p><p> Still on the Avenue, enjoying the bustle</p><p>of the crowds, the things in the shop </p><p>windows, he came to Madison Square </p><p>and sat down among the flotsajn and </p><p>jetsam of the city. Presently he pulled </p><p>out the paper and gradually became more </p><p>and more interested. On an inner page </p><p>was a half-tone engraving of two men in </p><p>the most modem of conventional attire, </p><p>silk-hatted yet prominently foreign, Ori- </p><p>ental. The caption read: </p><p> Prince Liu Chi and his cousin, Prince Ten Shin,</p><p>who have foresworn their ancient titles for China’s </p><p>new republicanism. They come to America as </p><p>deputies of the new government to study the </p><p>institutions and policies of the United States. </p><p> It was interesting reading to McNeill,</p><p>though he wondered at the strange turn </p><p>of mind that changed the descendants of so </p><p>old a dynasty to such ardent liberalists. </p><p>But the establishment of the new republic </p><p>upon so firm a basis as to make its envoys </p><p>recognized generally by the United States </p><p>Government, as these princes seemed to be, </p><p>to judge by what they had done and what </p><p>programs were still in store for them </p><p>officially, held a measure of comfort. </p><p> The old powers and traditions of Hoang</p><p>Lung would die hard, but they might, in </p><p>the rush of new thought and an open policy </p><p>toward the Occident, die swiftly. Much </p><p>of their power would be curtailed with their </p><p>prestige. They would lie low awhile until </p><p>the ever turning kaleidoscope of awakening </p><p>China shifted to a new pattern of the same </p><p>varicolored parts. </p><p> There would be a lifting of the ban</p><p>against the desecrators of the shrine, and </p><p>the followers of the old legendary faiths </p><p>would be content with the restoration of </p><p>their relic. He wondered if Prince Liu </p><p>Chi or his cousin had heard of the outrage. </p><p>If so their racial traits would hold the </p><p>memory despite the 'camouflage of New </p><p>World veneer. China’s ancient faith would </p><p>not change with its policies, save out- </p><p>wardly. The two nobles were registered </p><p>at his own hotel, he noted. </p><p> Another article flashed at him as he</p><p>turned the page. It was not a lengthy </p><p>one, but the headlines leaped at him, making </p><p>the half-inch capitals that formed the </p><p>name of Remsden seem as large as wood </p><p>block freak captions. The article read: </p><p>The Dragon’s Claw </p><p>161 </p><p> Howard Remsden, celebrated explorer and col-</p><p>lector of things anthropological, recently returned </p><p>from hazardous adventures in the interior of China, </p><p>was last night unanimously appointed president of </p><p>the Columbian Museum of Philological Research, </p><p>a post of great honor among scientists who strive </p><p>to build the ancient history of the races of the </p><p>world. After making his speech of acceptance, </p><p>Mr. Remsden formally presented the museum </p><p>with a curio that is without parallel—a relic dating </p><p>back to the myths of ancient China, no less an </p><p>object than the long worshipped claw of one of the </p><p>legendary dragon gods of the Flowery Kingdom. </p><p> This morning Mr. Remsden is to deliver an</p><p>address on this unique possession to the members of </p><p>the museum and other invited savants. Among </p><p>the guests will be the two visiting princes, Liu Chi </p><p>and Ten Shin. While Prince Liu Chi, when inter- </p><p>viewed last night at his hotel, laughingly deprecated </p><p>any belief that the claw actually belonged to such </p><p>a mythical demigod, he professed intense interest </p><p>in viewing it and listening to Mr. Remsden. </p><p> “Modem China looks at such things as a modem</p><p>American might the relics of some Indian cairn,” </p><p>said Prince Ten Shin in corroboration of his cousin’s </p><p>attitude. “It is fitting that the most progressive </p><p>of nations should hold such an antiquity. I under- </p><p>stand there are certain characters carven upon </p><p>the jade holder that may be of value to twentieth </p><p>century research, from our standpoint. We shall </p><p>certainly accept the invitation of the museum </p><p>authorities.” </p><p> Both princes speak English fluently and seem</p><p>entirely at home with our customs, which they </p><p>have largely adopted. </p><p> This was a staggering thing and McNeill,</p><p>mechanically folding up the paper, emitted </p><p>so sharp a whistle that the passers-by </p><p>looked at him curiously. But he paid no </p><p>heed to them. </p><p> How could Remsden have presented the</p><p>claw to the museum when, he, McNeill, </p><p>had given it over to Tao Chan as ransom </p><p>for the girl? Some jugglery had gone </p><p>on here—jugglery that increased the danger </p><p>to Remsden and his stepdaughter to tlie </p><p>wth degree. The visit of the two princes </p><p>could not be merely a coincidence. Their </p><p>liberalism was palpably a blind and their </p><p>real mission revealed. They were after the</p><p>claw. </p><p> Yet the claw was with Tao Chan. It</p><p>could not be possible that Remsden had </p><p>regained it. He had literally fled from </p><p>Peking. It was almost absurd to think </p><p>there was another relic like it. McNeill </p><p>was positive there was not. Even if there </p><p>was, the possession of it—the gift of it to </p><p>the museum would be as deadly. </p><p> The interview did not ring true to</p><p>McNeill. It might have been reported </p><p>correctly, but what did an American news- </p><p>paperman know of the subtleties of the </p><p>IX </p><p>Oriental mind? No matter what story </p><p>Remsden might have coined as to his </p><p>obtaining possession of the relic, to exhibit </p><p>such an object of reverence to the princes </p><p>would be, in their eyes, little short of an </p><p>insult—a sacrilege. They must surely know </p><p>all about what had happened at the temple. </p><p> While Americans might think little of a</p><p>Chinese museum having on show specimens </p><p>of early American culture or crudeness, </p><p>the claw had been imbedded for unrecorded </p><p>centuries in the heart of all that was </p><p>Chinese. It was interwoven with the </p><p>very essence of ancestor worship. It was </p><p>holy. No American who had not lived </p><p>years in China could ever hope to see the </p><p>differences of thought in such an affair. </p><p>The racial ideas of the two nations were </p><p>thousands of years apart. Even Remsden </p><p>could not properly sense what McNeill felt. </p><p> Now the claw was in the museum and</p><p>Remsden, in his blind pomposity, was </p><p>elevated to the pinnacle he had been </p><p>willing to spend so much—to risk so much </p><p>—to obtain. But, in the eyes of the princes, </p><p>for all their affectation of Occidental ideas, </p><p>Remsden was a profaner of shrines, a robber </p><p>of China’s holy of holies. McNeill had </p><p>to admit that the museum must have the </p><p>claw, though how this had happened was </p><p>a riddle hard to solve. </p><p> What would be the next move? pon-</p><p>dered McNeill. An attempt to get hold </p><p>of the claw, or swift and horrible revenge </p><p>upon Helen, her stepfather and, perhaps, </p><p>himself, if they knew of his presence in </p><p>New York. </p><p> McNeill strove to unravel what might</p><p>be in the minds of the two princes and then </p><p>he started north for the Remsdens. It </p><p>was vital that he should find out just what </p><p>had occurred—what Remsden had done— </p><p>where the claw came from. He wondered </p><p>whether Helen had been present at the </p><p>reception. The early evening editions came </p><p>out, but there was nothing more in them. </p><p>A Wall Street magnate had collapsed, and </p><p>the market was in jeopardy. The Chinese </p><p>princes were eclipsed, Remsden forgotten. </p><p>THE East Nineties reached and </p><p>the house located, McNeill sent in </p><p>his card by a serving man who ele- </p><p>vated his eyebrows the slightest bit as he </p><p>pronounced the name and then, ushering </p><p>McNeill into a reception room, said— </p><p> “I’ll see if Miss Remsden is at home, sir.”</p><p>162 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> McNeill heard a door shut somewhere</p><p>down the hall. Then he caught faint </p><p>echoes of a voice he recognized as Rems- </p><p>den’s. The man came back, demurely </p><p>apologetic. </p><p> “Miss Remsden is not at home, sir.</p><p>Gone out of town for a few days. Mr. </p><p>Remsden said he would see you some other </p><p>time, sir, regretting that he is very busy </p><p>just now, sir. Yes, sir. T thank you.” </p><p> McNeill had done nothing to render the</p><p>man grateful and he went out to his still </p><p>waiting taxi a little hurt, a great deal dis- </p><p>appointed, and much more worried. At </p><p>his hotel a note was awaiting him that had </p><p>been brought by special messenger. It </p><p>read: </p><p>Dear Mr. McNeii.l: </p><p> Your flowers were beautiful and it was very</p><p>thoughttul of you to send them. I hope I am going </p><p>to see you soon, but father seems for some reason </p><p>opposed at present to your coming to the house. </p><p> I am sure, however, that there will soon come an</p><p>opportunity for thanking you in person better than </p><p>I can by this brief note. </p><p> Sincerely yours,</p><p>Helen Remsden. </p><p> And the note was dated that afternoon</p><p>and superscribed— </p><p>This Afternoon, </p><p> At Home.</p><p> “So that is how the wind blows?” said</p><p>McNeill sotto voce. “The old boy thinks </p><p>I’ll bawl him out whatever yarn he puts </p><p>up about getting the claw. For that I’m </p><p>to be lied to and refused admittance. We’ll </p><p>see about that. I wonder if the fool thinks </p><p>he is not in actual danger?” </p><p> He dressed for his lonely dinner for the</p><p>sheer pleasure of wearing clothes long for- </p><p>eign to him, and the head waiter, recog- </p><p>nizing an out-of-the-ordinary person in Ins </p><p>appearance, gave him a good table just the</p><p>right distance from the music and not far </p><p>from where the Chinese princes were emi- </p><p>nently enjoying an Occidental menu. </p><p> They were with a party of American men</p><p>and women, the latter exploiting foreign </p><p>magnates to their own gratification. No </p><p>one seemed to look his way and he lingered </p><p>over his own carefully chosen meal after </p><p>the eastern royalty had left. His tip duly </p><p>impressed his waiter, as did his word of </p><p>thanks for service. The man lingered. </p><p> “I beg your pardon, sir,” he said, “but</p><p>the man who waited on them foreign chaps </p><p>wanted to find out your name. Of course </p><p>I didn’t know it sir, but-?” </p><p> “He could easily have got it, I suppose.</p><p>Thanks.” </p><p> “Ever been there, sir? China, I mean.</p><p>I’ve got a cousin in Shanghai who sells </p><p>sewing-machines. Doing well, too.” </p><p> “Yes, I’ve been there. He should do</p><p>well. Reserve this table for me tomorrow </p><p>night, will you?” </p><p> “Yes, sir.”</p><p> So one of the princes, or both, had been</p><p>interested in him. Why? McNeill cogi- </p><p>tated over that a long time that night </p><p>before he went to sleep. And, in the morn- </p><p>ing, he fancied he began to see the answer. </p><p> The claw was to the fore in the papers</p><p>once more. The museum had been broken </p><p>into some time between two and three </p><p>o’clock. Only the vigilance of the special </p><p>watchmen had prevented serious vandalism. </p><p>The intruders were masked. Only a glimpse </p><p>had been caught of them in the Oriental </p><p>gallery where the claw of the dragon king, </p><p>presented by the newly elected president, </p><p>was deposited. A protective agency man, </p><p>felt-shod, had seen the marauders bending </p><p>over the case in which the claw had been </p><p>placed. He shouted and fired as the </p><p>burglars rushed for an open window from </p><p>which the netting had been removed. Two </p><p>other watchmen had rushed to his assist- </p><p>ance and a general alarm was turned in. </p><p> Blood was found on the windowsill,</p><p>showing that the bullet of the watchman </p><p>had been well aimed. Traces of a ladder, </p><p>presumably of the extension variety, were </p><p>found in the turf below the windows. It </p><p>was said that a swift car had been seen </p><p>breaking the speed limits in the vicinity </p><p>of the museum. The police believed they </p><p>had an important clew. Special precau- </p><p>tions were to be taken to safeguard the </p><p>curio. </p><p> Prince Liu Chi could not be reached this</p><p>morning, the paper stated, having re- </p><p>tired, but his secretary announced the </p><p>sincere regrets of both their highnesses at </p><p>the occurrence, coupled with an expression </p><p>of thanks that the attempt had failed and </p><p>a hope that the robbers would be given over </p><p>to the justice of American law and order. </p><p> The telephone rang as McNeill was</p><p>reading over the article the second time. </p><p>It was Helen Remsden’s voice he recog- </p><p>nized. </p><p> “Can you come up here, right away?”</p><p>The Dragon’s Claw </p><p>163 </p><p>she asked, and her voice quivered with </p><p>anxiety. “Father is dreadfully upset and </p><p>wants to see you as soon as possible.” </p><p> “I’m starting now,” McNeill answered.</p><p> “Wants to make me his burden-bearer</p><p>once more, I suppose,” McNeill told him- </p><p>self as he hastily finished his dressing. </p><p>“Well, I’m not going without breakfast </p><p>for his sake.” </p><p>CHAPTER VII </p><p>THE GLOVE OF VELVET </p><p>SOMETHING had surely happened to </p><p>Howard Remsden. Gone was his </p><p>attempt at patronizing McNeill, gone </p><p>was his smug assurance. The man seemed </p><p>to have shrunk like a balloon from which </p><p>enough gas has escaped to make the outline </p><p>flabby. His florid complexion was blotched </p><p>and there were sagging pouches under his </p><p>eyes, which themselves held a constant </p><p>appeal. Something had evidently fright- </p><p>ened Remsden badly and he clung to </p><p>McNeill’s hand as would a despairing </p><p>swimmer to the rescuer. </p><p> McNeill was not particularly sorry for</p><p>him and he did not pretend to be. It was </p><p>the request of Helen Remsden and the look </p><p>in her eyes that proclaimed him her cham- </p><p>pion, that made him more than barely civil </p><p>to her stepfather. Moreover, whatever peril </p><p>faced him included her. For his own, he </p><p>was not bothering just then. </p><p> “I want you to read this first, Neill,”</p><p>said Remsden. “I am not good at Chinese </p><p>script, as you know; then I’ll tell you </p><p>everything. They are after the claw!” </p><p> He lowered his voice as a servant entered</p><p>the library where they were closeted, a </p><p>magnificent room of carved paneling, carved </p><p>furniture and gorgeous Oriental hangings </p><p>and rugs. </p><p> “The men have come about putting up</p><p>the bars, sir,” said the servant, the same </p><p>man who had refused McNeill permission </p><p>to see Miss Remsden the day before. </p><p> Neill held nothing against him for obeying</p><p>orders—a flunkey must lie when his master </p><p>tells him, he supposed—-and today there </p><p>was a deference in the man’s manner </p><p>toward the visitor that showed that he </p><p>was universally regarded in the Remsden </p><p>household as the man of the hour. </p><p> “Tell ’em to begin with my bedroom and</p><p>Miss Remsden’s, Jackson,” said Remsden. </p><p>“I’m having the windows all barred,” he </p><p>said. “The house is otherwise protected </p><p>but, one never knows.” </p><p> The hands of the collector and new</p><p>president of the Philological Museum were </p><p>visibly trembling. His cocksureness had </p><p>evaporated but McNeill could not resist </p><p>getting in one dig. </p><p> “Even in America?” he asked.</p><p> Remsden reddened.</p><p> “Even in America,” he admitted. “There</p><p>are subtle forces at work, McNeill. I feel </p><p>them. Those two princes-” </p><p> He shuddered and passed the scroll of</p><p>ricepaper that had been fluttering in his </p><p>nervous hands across to McNeill. </p><p> “I found this pinned to my coverlet</p><p>this morning,” he said. “Pinned by this.” </p><p> He took from a drawer of the massive desk</p><p>at which he was sitting a pin of soft gold, </p><p>exquisitely carved in the shape of a dragon. </p><p> “The imperial dragon,” he said. “Six-</p><p>clawed! How could it have come there, </p><p>McNeill? My servants might have been </p><p>bribed, but they could not lie to me success- </p><p>fully, and the door to my room was locked </p><p>and bolted. 1 had locked the shutters of </p><p>my windows on the outside. I had searched </p><p>my room before I went to bed. I have </p><p>been all nerves lately—since yesterday. </p><p>But there it was.” </p><p> He went with dragging heels to a side-</p><p>board and helped himself to brandy and </p><p>soda, offering some to McNeill, who, study- </p><p>ing the scroll, refused with a shake of his </p><p>head. </p><p> “Want me to read it aloud?” he asked</p><p>Remsden. </p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> The hesitation in his voice was like that</p><p>of a prisoner about to hear a death warrant. </p><p>McNeill studied over the hieroglyphs once </p><p>more. </p><p> “This is a fairly exact translation,” he</p><p>premised. </p><p> “Time holds the eternal balances,</p><p> But man may weight the scales.</p><p> A maid and a flower—both are beautiful.</p><p> Yet, when the wind blows from the East,</p><p> Lo, they perish as straws in the furnace!'’</p><p> “The wind—from the East—from</p><p>China!” groaned Remsden. “The maid, </p><p>that means Helen!” </p><p> There was a real note of anguish in his</p><p>voice that surprized McNeill. He had not </p><p>thought that Remsden was capable of </p><p>such genuine affection for the girl. He </p><p>Adventure </p><p>himself plainly understood the subtle threat </p><p>and his jaw set hard before he took up the </p><p>reading: </p><p>“Who shall stay the hand of the Reaper? </p><p>Only he who hath a clear conscience need not fear </p><p> him.</p><p>Yet restitution may purge the soul, </p><p>But the path of the perverse one shall be sown with </p><p> knives.</p><p>Wo, wo unto him who mocks the ghosts of a thou- </p><p> sand generations!</p><p>The gods are great—and awful is their vengeance! </p><p>They strike, and we see not whence comes the blow, </p><p>nor when. </p><p>Neither do their hearts soften to the stubborn evil- </p><p> doer.</p><p>Terror shall go down with him into the Place of </p><p> Shadows!"</p><p> “Well?” asked Remsden. “What do you</p><p>make of it?” </p><p> “It is not time for me to talk yet,” said</p><p>McNeill. “I want some explanations from </p><p>you. To save your stepdaughter from the </p><p>fanatic priests, I took back the claw to </p><p>the temple, not with any eagerness on </p><p>your part, at that. I saw the claw turned </p><p>over to the priest and I returned with </p><p>Helen—with Miss Remsden. Now, in New </p><p>York, I read that you have presented the </p><p>claw to the museum and now, for the </p><p>second time,' you tell me that she is in </p><p>jeopardy on account of it, and on account </p><p>of your own infernal ambition,” he added </p><p>grimly. </p><p> “Now, Remsden, you concealed from me</p><p>your first depredations from the temple. </p><p>Don’t hide anything from me this time. </p><p>I warn you that if your stepdaughter’s fife </p><p>hangs by a thread, as I believe it does, </p><p>yours is still closer to annihilation.” </p><p> He saw in the dilated eyes of Remsden</p><p>that he, too, realized this. It was not </p><p>terror for liis stepdaughter as much as for </p><p>himself that had shaken him. She was a </p><p>pawn seized in the game whose capture left</p><p>him, the king, open to attack. </p><p> “Now then,” McNeill went on, “is this</p><p>claw you have given the museum another, </p><p>inferior specimen that somewhere you have </p><p>got hold of or is it a fake that you have </p><p>perpetrated after having to restore the </p><p>original. And what cock-and-bull story </p><p>have you foisted off on the museum con- </p><p>cerning it? If it is so, while the princes, </p><p>knowing the true claw safe and sound, </p><p>have laughed at you and all America in </p><p>their Oriental sleeves, you have never- </p><p>theless exposed yourself as the man who </p><p>ravished their sacred shrine, and now they </p><p>preshadow their revenge. </p><p> “Or, is there something deeper? What-</p><p>ever it is, come clean with it. Helen, </p><p>whom I love, is in danger. I am included </p><p>in all likelihood. They tried to bowstring </p><p>me in California. As for yourself, your </p><p>death is certain unless intervention comes. </p><p>And it will not be a pleasant death, Rems- </p><p>den, for all your vaunt of New York police </p><p>protection, for all your steel bars, I am </p><p>the only one who might help you, who </p><p>must help you, for Helen’s sake. But you </p><p>must tell me the truth—the whole truth </p><p>and nothing but the truth.” </p><p> Remsden moistened his lips. Once more</p><p>he lowered his voice to a whisper, took a long </p><p>sip of the brandy and water and glanced </p><p>fearfully about the room. </p><p> “It is the original,” he said. “The claw</p><p>in the museum, I mean.” </p><p> McNeill’s jaw began to protrude and his</p><p>forehead to knit. Remsden hurried on: </p><p>“I’ll tell you everything, McNeill. It’s </p><p>due you, in a way, I’ll grant that. Of </p><p>course you came out all right. There was </p><p>no chance of a slip, and I offered you extra </p><p>compensation for the risk. </p><p>“WHEN I told you in Peking that </p><p>I didn’t have the claw and couldn’t </p><p>get it for two days, it was because </p><p>I had entrusted it to a Chinese jeweler </p><p>for duplication. A wonderful craftsman, </p><p>the only man in China, I think, who could </p><p>have copied it, and you know what wonders </p><p>the Orientals are at duplication. I had to </p><p>pay him an enormous sum to overcome his </p><p>superstitions—almost as much as I paid</p><p>Fung-Ti in the first place—but he did it </p><p>He brought the two to me at the Im- </p><p>perial-” </p><p> “I saw the man,” said McNeill shortly.</p><p>"I thought you had referred it to him for an </p><p>opinion. Go on.” </p><p> “The facsimile was perfect. I couldn’t</p><p>have known them apart and I made the </p><p>closest examination. I doubt if the old </p><p>craftsman himself would have known the </p><p>difference, once they were juggled, if I </p><p>hadn’t taken the precaution to impregnate </p><p>the original with ambergris. The perfume </p><p>sank into the jade and the claw, and some </p><p>of it still clings. The copy, of course, was </p><p>unscented.” </p><p> He sat back with a glint of satisfaction</p><p>on his features at the cleverness he had </p><p>The Dragon’s Claw </p><p>165 </p><p>shown, but this faded at the sight of </p><p>McNeill’s face. </p><p> “So you deliberately sent me back to</p><p>the Hoang Lung with a duplicate when </p><p>Helen’s life was hanging in the balance! </p><p>Her honor, the prospect of horrible degrada- </p><p>tion and torture all depended on it—not </p><p>to speak of my own safety or my own honor. </p><p>I swore to Tao Chan that I had kept faith </p><p>with him. Remsden, there are no words </p><p>that I am capable of to tell you what I </p><p>think of you—a man so besotted by his </p><p>own puny chance for fame that he </p><p>would-” </p><p> “I tell you there was no chance of a slip.</p><p>The two could not be told apart.” </p><p> “And what if I had been delayed upon</p><p>the trip? Your master-craftsman, whose </p><p>dread you thought you had bought over </p><p>with your gold, was still the slave of his </p><p>superstitions. We met him hurrying to </p><p>Hoang Lung to confess to the trickery. </p><p>I thought he was merely bearing the news </p><p>of the theft and laughed at the poor fool. </p><p>He was death incarnate riding to our de- </p><p>struction! Twenty-four hours after he had </p><p>passed us Tao Chan knew what you had </p><p>done. </p><p> “I wouldn’t give the seed of a dried fig for</p><p>your life, Remsden, for all your bars and </p><p>your protection. You have deserved the </p><p>death of Fung-Ti, in my estimation, you </p><p>vile imitation of a pariah! If it wasn’t </p><p>that your dirty chicanery involved Helen </p><p>I would beat you to a pulp and leave this </p><p>house in the sure knowledge that, if you </p><p>don’t die of heart failure from cowardice, </p><p>it is because the gods they write of in this </p><p>script have reserved you for something more </p><p>appropriate in the way of punishment.” </p><p>He had risen and was towering over the </p><p>crumpled Remsden, who was whining in his </p><p>chair. </p><p> “Don’t go back on me, McNeill! For</p><p>Helen’s sake! I did not dream of the </p><p>jeweler’s going to Hoang Lung. </p><p> “The fives of the three of us are in</p><p>jeopardy. Yours is forfeit.”</p><p> “There must be some way out, McNeill—</p><p>some way.” </p><p> “There is one chance—to make restitu-</p><p>tion of the claw. It is possible they may </p><p>make terms—may keep them. I can see </p><p>these two princes. They have evidently </p><p>been communicated with by cable from </p><p>China. For all their avowal of modem </p><p>thought, they have still to play politick at </p><p>home. I have reason to believe that they </p><p>can be treated with.” </p><p> “Yes, I think so. But I can’t give them</p><p>back the claw, McNeill.” </p><p> “Why not?”</p><p> Remsden gulped the rest of his liquor.</p><p>A stubborn look was on his face. </p><p> “Because I can’t, and I won’t. I’ve</p><p>been upset a bit. That paper, and some- </p><p>thing that happened yesterday—but,- </p><p>it, this is America and bigger men than I </p><p>have been safeguarded for years against </p><p>greater perils. I’ll—I’ll go to sea, if </p><p>necessary, and stay there. I have my own </p><p>yacht. I’ll take Helen with me. You can </p><p>come along too, if you are so afraid of the </p><p>vengeance of Tao Chan or whatever his </p><p>name is. But I won’t give it up.” </p><p> Back of the man’s bluster, that yet was</p><p>not all bluff, for it was backed by deter- </p><p>mination, McNeiU read accurately the </p><p>reason for his stiffening. He would not </p><p>sacrifice his own presidency, so long coveted. </p><p>In all probability it had been obtained by </p><p>his promise of the relic to the museum. </p><p>Such arrangements were not uncommon. </p><p>To take back the claw would mean his </p><p>resignation, an awkward explanation, per- </p><p>haps making him the laughing stock of the </p><p>scientific world. Far rather would Rems- </p><p>den sacrifice any one near and dear to him, </p><p>even run the chance of death for himself. </p><p> “I am not afraid,” said McNeill. “It is</p><p>quite possible that you may be able to safe- </p><p>guard yourself for a time, but I am going </p><p>to do one tiling. I am going to convince </p><p>Prince Liu Chi and Prince Ten Shin of the </p><p>absolute innocence of Helen and myself </p><p>in this matter. After that you can do as</p><p>you please. If I can’t convince them </p><p>I shall give out the true story of the claw.” </p><p> “Ah-ha! To whom? The press? Do</p><p>you think they would believe you—take </p><p>the word of a penniless adventurer against </p><p>Howard Remsden? I would say you were </p><p>attempting to blackmail me.” </p><p> “You would be very sorry if you did,</p><p>Remsden,” replied McNeill quietly. “Very </p><p>sorry, I assure you, but there is no use </p><p>wrangling. I’ll see the princes. As for </p><p>yourself, you seem to have changed your </p><p>attitude since I arrived. It may be the </p><p>brandy or perhaps your nerves react </p><p>swiftly. If I can get what I deem satis- </p><p>factory assurance from Liu Chi and Ten </p><p>Shin as to the safety of your stepdaughter </p><p>and myself, why, you can take your own </p><p>Adventure </p><p>measures for protection. They may be </p><p>quite sufficient, if expensive. Good morn- </p><p>ing.” </p><p> “Hold on a minute, McNeill. There is</p><p>no good wrangling, as you say. I’m getting </p><p>on a bit. Never used to know what nerves </p><p>were, like you. It’s indigestion; that’s </p><p>what it is. But you’ll let me know how </p><p>you come out with the princes, won’t you?” </p><p> Neill reflected. It would give him a good</p><p>reason for coming back—a chance to see </p><p>Helen. </p><p> “You said something happened yester-</p><p>day,” he said. “At the meeting when </p><p>you gave your address, I suppose. What </p><p>was it?” </p><p> “Doubtless I exaggerated it,” said Rems-</p><p>den. </p><p> The colossal conceit and egoism of</p><p>the man had already restored him from </p><p>the fright caused by the finding of the </p><p>paper pinned to his counterpane. Now a </p><p>shadow of fear was visible. He hesitated. </p><p> “It was awkward—unexpected,” he be-</p><p>gan, “I mean the presence in New York </p><p>of Liu Chi and Ten Shin. Then some of </p><p>the committee asked them to be present </p><p>and the press took it up. It was em- </p><p>barrassing. I had to change the talk </p><p>I had prepared in some measure.” </p><p> Remsden got fiery red under McNeill’s</p><p>shrewd look. </p><p> “But it went off well enough until it came</p><p>to meeting the princes. I say well enough, </p><p>though I had felt all through my speech </p><p>that they were laughing at me—you know </p><p>what I mean, McNeill, those ivory faces, </p><p>motionless, the smooth lids that don’t </p><p>open like a white man’s, they just slit apart </p><p>and you see their black eyes laughing at you, </p><p>like mocking devils. And, when they </p><p>shook hands, it was like touching the skin </p><p>of a snake! </p><p> “ ‘Hands across the sea,’ that’s what</p><p>Liu Chi said, ‘we are not so far apart, </p><p>Mr. Remsden, after all.’ That was a </p><p>threat, all right—a touch of the velvet </p><p>glove. Nothing of the hatchetman method</p><p>about those two slick yellow devils, Mc- </p><p>Neill. And they smiled when they handled </p><p>the claw. I had a wild idea that they </p><p>might try to claim it. I would never </p><p>have made the presentation if I had known </p><p>of their presence in the country, but they </p><p>just smiled with their eyes and gave it back </p><p>to Forsythe, our curator, who was watching </p><p>them as he does every one, even me, with </p><p>the eyes of a hawk. The gift belongs to </p><p>the museum and he is responsible. Every </p><p>one is a possible thief in his eyes.” </p><p> “I suppose,” commented McNeill, “that</p><p>all ancient curios may be styled stolen </p><p>goods. The dead and their habitations </p><p>have been ravished of jewels; temples of </p><p>their carvings and inscriptions-” </p><p> “That’s it exactly, Neill,” broke in</p><p>Remsden. “That’s the point of view you </p><p>must take. Science must not be judged, </p><p>however, by the rules applied to the living. </p><p>I do not consider myself a thief but a—■ </p><p>a-” </p><p> “A benefactor.” The sarcasm was lost.</p><p>“It was the way the prince said ‘we are </p><p>not so far apart,’ that impressed me. </p><p>They are both in it. They mean to get it. </p><p>They were at the bottom of the attempted </p><p>robbery last night.” </p><p> “If it had been possible for the duplicated</p><p>claw to get across,” said McNeill, “they </p><p>might have made a shift. That would </p><p>have eased matters. But it would take </p><p>some powerful influence to make Tao Chan </p><p>let even the copy go. The shrine has </p><p>worshipers and he will not let the common </p><p>people know of the substitution. It would </p><p>spell peril for him to be without the </p><p>fetish. </p><p> “But I will let you know the result of my</p><p>interview. Now, for my own business. </p><p>I would like to see Miss Helen. I might </p><p>tell you that those affairs of mine are no </p><p>longer in the air. They are being exploited </p><p>with ample capital and protection.” </p><p> “I am glad to hear it, glad to hear it,</p><p>I am sure. Wish you every success.” </p><p>Remsden touched a bell. “Tell Miss Helen </p><p>that Mr. McNeill would like to see her, </p><p>Jackson.”</p><p>McNEILL found Helen Remsden </p><p>in her own parlor. Thankful that </p><p>she was not the type that required </p><p>reservations, he told her frankly that there </p><p>was a certain menace concerning the claw. </p><p>That her stepfather had fallen in her esti- </p><p>mation was evident. She had thought the </p><p>present he had made to the museum was </p><p>merely a clever substitution and, though </p><p>she said nothing as to the risk to which </p><p>they had been exposed at the Hoang Lung </p><p>temple, her manner conveyed her opinion </p><p>of the man who had prompted it. </p><p> “I think I can remove the menace,” said</p><p>McNeill, “but your father-” </p><p>The Dragon’s Claw </p><p>167 </p><p> “My stepfather,” she corrected point-</p><p>edly. </p><p> “Your stepfather must be made to return</p><p>the claw.” </p><p> “He will not do that,” she affirmed.</p><p>“He would have to degrade himself in his </p><p>own light. The museum would have to </p><p>acknowledge having been deceived. He </p><p>would lose his presidency.” </p><p> “I think there may be a way out,” said</p><p>McNeill. “I am to come again tomorrow. </p><p>Shall I see you?” </p><p> “Certainly. I shall be glad.”</p><p> McNeill went off happily, but he had</p><p>all his wits about him and he did not fail </p><p>to see a man, who had been lounging at </p><p>the corner, slouchingly follow. Neill had </p><p>dismissed his taxi and now he swung into </p><p>the park. His shadow persisted and Mc- </p><p>Neill led him on at a smart pace, turning </p><p>a corner abruptly and hiding behind some </p><p>shrubbery. He saw the man go by and </p><p>saw also, stamped on his skull-like face, </p><p>the evidence of opium. </p><p> “I shall have an interesting interview</p><p>with our Oriental potentates, I fancy,” </p><p>he told himself as he caught a bus to return </p><p>to his hotel. </p><p> His room was made up. Pinned to the</p><p>pillow-sham was a gold dragon, six-clawed, </p><p>made into a stick pin. McNeill shrugged </p><p>his shoulders. </p><p> “Nothing small about their methods,”</p><p>he said aloud, then deliberately removed </p><p>the pearl from the scarf and replaced it </p><p>with the emblem of the dragon-kmg. </p><p>CHAPTER VIII </p><p>THE HAND OF STEEL </p><p>THE suites allotted to Princes Liu Chi </p><p>and Ten Shin were costly according </p><p>their capaciousness, running the full </p><p>length of one corridor of the famous New </p><p>York hostelry. A private elevator was </p><p>part of the equipment and to this McNeill,</p><p>having arranged his appointment, was </p><p>ushered by the urbane secretary of the </p><p>imperial entourage that, despite their </p><p>affectation of democracy, still retained </p><p>the attributes of Chinese aristocracy and </p><p>accompanying wealth. </p><p> A Chines boy was elevator pilot and,</p><p>once on the floor of the suite, America </p><p>gave place to the Flowery Kingdom. </p><p>There was no suggestion of anything </p><p>Occidental, save in the electric fixtures, </p><p>disguised beneath oiled-silk lanterns, and </p><p>the telephones. Either brought with them, </p><p>or secured from New York Oriental mer- </p><p>chants, the furniture, the rugs, the hangings </p><p>—every detail were those of an imperial </p><p>apartment in the Forbidden City. </p><p> The secretary, in American clothes, dis-</p><p>appeared in the ante-chamber and pres- </p><p>ently a giant Chinaman, whose silken garb </p><p>bore the insignia of the royal house, ushered </p><p>McNeill into a room where Liu Chi and </p><p>Ten Shin, arrayed in magnificent brocades, </p><p>rose to meet him and bade him be seated </p><p>upon a lounge tapestried with sprawling </p><p>dragons. </p><p> McNeill still wore the dragon pin,</p><p>dressed as he was for the morning appoint- </p><p>ment, and a compact automatic was ready </p><p>to his hand. It would not be hard to </p><p>dispose of him, he reflected, if he gave </p><p>them the chance. He had come up in a </p><p>private elevator. No one would know </p><p>when he went down, if he ever did, save a </p><p>Chinaman. His body could be smuggled </p><p>out in some trunk and got rid of quietly. </p><p>McNeill was not morbid about this possi- </p><p>bility. It was quite on the cards and he </p><p>prepared for it as best he could. </p><p> “I expect an important call in some</p><p>fifteen minutes,” he said after the due </p><p>ceremonial of greeting had been gone </p><p>through. “Would it be too much if it was </p><p>transmitted to me here?” </p><p> Liu Chi smiled and gave orders in his own</p><p>language to that effect. </p><p> “To what do we owe the pleasure of this</p><p>visit, Mr. McNeill? We have heard that </p><p>you have visited our country, have, in fact, </p><p>lived there for several years. That is inter- </p><p>esting. You will realize, for one thing,</p><p>the difficulty of assimilation that besets </p><p>a land like ours in taking up Occidental </p><p>thought and ideas, when my countrymen </p><p>are so steeped with ignorance and super- </p><p>stition. But we must do the best we can.” </p><p> The idea of these two imperious beings,</p><p>bred of a thousand years of despotic </p><p>measure, being seriously inclined to sim- </p><p>plicity of any sort that bespoke equality, </p><p>struck McNcill as absurd. It would take </p><p>many generations for China to become a </p><p>true republic. Liu Chi and Ten Shin </p><p>were merely going with the current and </p><p>taking good care of themselves mean- </p><p>while. He decided to match Oriental </p><p>guile with Yankee-Irish bluntness of attack. </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “I have come here to tell you a straight</p><p>tale,” he commenced and recited, omitting </p><p>no detail, the history of the claw from the </p><p>time he had first met Remsden and, at- </p><p>tracted by Helen, agreed to act as guide </p><p>and interpreter. Through it all the two </p><p>princes sat like statues, immutable, their </p><p>eyes only shown by narrow bars of glitter- </p><p>ing jet between their narrowed lids. So </p><p>did the imperial mandarins sit in justice. </p><p>At the close Ten Shin started to exchange </p><p>a few words with his cousin, but McNeill </p><p>interrupted: </p><p> “I understand the Mandarin dialect,”</p><p>he said. </p><p> Ten Slain and Liu Chi gravely nodded</p><p>an acknowledgment. </p><p> “That is very honorable of you,” said</p><p>the latter. “And honor does not dwell in </p><p>unclean places.” </p><p> But, for all their politeness, McNeill</p><p>believed the tiling had been a test. Anyway </p><p>he had scored. </p><p> “Your tale is well told,” said Liu Chi.</p><p>“Yet we can not think why you should </p><p>think us especially interested. The mu- </p><p>seums of England, of France, of all coun- </p><p>tries hold relics of past races. Our own </p><p>country has long been overrun by con- </p><p>querors; it is the most polyglot of nations, </p><p>of mixed blood, mixed faiths. ‘The old </p><p>order changeth, yielding place to new,’ as </p><p>Tennyson writes. And we, my cousin and </p><p>myself, are of the new order. </p><p> “We can not hold any responsibility for</p><p>Mr. Remsden’s emotions. The Hoang </p><p>Lung is a far-reacliing organization, linked </p><p>by mysticism as it is. It is possible that </p><p>some of their members may have attempted </p><p>to threaten Mr. Remsden and play upon </p><p>his fears, but, of a surety, we do not wish </p><p>the claw. We were curious to see it, yes, </p><p>but there our interest ceases. We came </p><p>here for things concerning this generation </p><p>and those to come, Mr. McNeill, long </p><p>before Mr. Remsden visited the temple of </p><p>Hoang Lung. You must be aware of that. </p><p> “You seem to make it very plain that</p><p>neither Miss Remsden nor yourself were </p><p>implicated in this matter or in the sub-</p><p>stitution. I sincerely trust that, if any </p><p>members of the Hoang Lung are in doubt </p><p>as to this, they may be convinced before </p><p>they carry out any threats, if they so </p><p>intend.” </p><p> McNeill, listening to the smooth syllables,</p><p>with all the difficult r’s sounded perfectly, </p><p>knew that Liu Chi was lying, but he could </p><p>do nothing. They also thought that he had </p><p>lied concerning the innocence of Helen </p><p>and himself in the affair, or they did not </p><p>care. Ten Shin took up the talk. </p><p> “We can not pretend to influence such</p><p>of our countrymen who may still cling </p><p>to superstition,” he said. “We have de- </p><p>liberately severed ourselves from such. </p><p>We shall hope, of course, to teach them </p><p>better in time. We are sorry we can do </p><p>nothing for you, glad to have listened to </p><p>you. We would suggest that, for Mr. </p><p>Remsden’s peace of mind, he might open </p><p>up negotiations for the return or exchange </p><p>of the claw, speaking merely as those having </p><p>knowledge of the workings of the Chinese </p><p>trend of thought. One unfortunate national </p><p>characteristic of ours is revenge, particu- </p><p>larly when allied to faiths, however loosely </p><p>foimded. </p><p> “You evidently, from the style of the</p><p>communication conveyed to Mr. Remsden, </p><p>have to do with a clever mentality. I </p><p>would suggest that any reprisal that might </p><p>be intended would be divided into two </p><p>parts—punishment and insistence upon the </p><p>return of the true relic. As long as Mr. </p><p>Remsden seems the key, the only key to </p><p>that return, so long will he be safe from </p><p>punishment. As to the reference to Miss </p><p>Remsden, speaking again from the general </p><p>understanding of my more bigoted and </p><p>ignorant countrymen, I fear, I greatly </p><p>fear that, even if we could interfere, it </p><p>would be too late.” </p><p> “Just exactly what do you mean?” asked</p><p>McNeill. </p><p> The absolutely unemotional, even pro-</p><p>nunciation, like drops of water falling on </p><p>the bar of a xylophone, the mask-like faces, </p><p>the atmosphere of the room with its dim </p><p>lights, masked windows, a hint of incense, </p><p>had gradually chilled him. These men </p><p>were pitiless.</p><p> “Mr. Remsden was warned yesterday.”</p><p> Then Helen had been already struck in</p><p>some mysterious way. McNeill’s fingers </p><p>gripped his automatic. His muscles tensed. </p><p> A telephone sounded.</p><p> “Your call, I think, Mr. McNeill.”</p><p> He had asked Helen to call him, partly</p><p>to assure her that he was working in her </p><p>interests, partly as a bluff to the princes. </p><p>His spirit lightened as he heard her </p><p>voice. </p><p> “And I suppose I have you to thank for</p><p>The Dragon’s Claw </p><p>the magnificent roses,” she was saying. </p><p>“You mustn’t be so extravagant.” </p><p> “It was not I,” he answered. “But I’ll</p><p>see you this afternoon.” </p><p> He hung up the receiver in relief. He was</p><p>certain that the two princes were watching </p><p>him covertly, as cats might watch a mouse. </p><p>But Helen was safe, despite their covert </p><p>threats. </p><p> Again he tried the direct method.</p><p> “If I succeed in getting Mr. Remsden</p><p>to relinquish the claw,” he said, “could </p><p>I count upon your influence to have the </p><p>news transmitted to those most inter- </p><p>ested—to Tao Chan for example?” </p><p> “You may be assured, Mr. McNeill,</p><p>that we will do all that we can. For your </p><p>own warning, if you so regard the pin you </p><p>found on your pillow, we can hardly better </p><p>recommend you than to the wonderful </p><p>protective methods of your great city, </p><p>many of which we hope to ultimately adopt </p><p>or adapt. Before we leave we hope to </p><p>give a banquet to those with whom we have </p><p>come in close contact. May I hope that </p><p>you will be present?” </p><p>RjS DISMISSED, down in the private </p><p>elevator and back into America </p><p>again, McNeill went chagrined to his </p><p>own room. He knew that he had failed, </p><p>that he had touched only the shell of the </p><p>consciousness of the princes. Not one </p><p>shade of doubt, of surprize, of anger or </p><p>pity, not one atom of any emotion had they </p><p>shown. He might as well have spoken </p><p>to the lacquered images in the temple at </p><p>Hoang Lung. But from that minute he </p><p>would watch the safety of Helen. She </p><p>must be made to understand her danger. </p><p>The infinite sarcasm of his reception </p><p>burned within him. He had been as im- </p><p>potent as a small boy blowing bubbles at </p><p>the feet of the great statue of Buddha at </p><p>Laiting. </p><p> He was before his time at the Remsden</p><p>residence, but Helen was expecting him. </p><p>The roses she had spoken of were in a tall </p><p>vase of metal—gorgeous American Beauty </p><p>roses several feet tall. </p><p> “The most exquisite, royal things,” she</p><p>said. “And the thorniest! But you have </p><p>to pay for them by the length of the stem, </p><p>I understand. I thought they were from </p><p>you and I was going to scold you for the </p><p>pricks I got in arranging them.” </p><p> “I wish I had thought of them,” said</p><p>McNeill regretfully. “And I am very </p><p>sorry for the damaged fingers. Was the^e </p><p>no card with them?” </p><p> “No. I looked carefully. But they</p><p>came from your hotel.” </p><p> McNeill looked thoughtful for a moment.</p><p>“I have promised to see your father </p><p>before I go,” he said. “I failed to convince </p><p>the princes. They pleaded lack of interest </p><p>and, in almost the same breath, emphasized </p><p>the threat. You have got to be careful </p><p>of your comings and goings, Helen. Promise </p><p>me that you will?” </p><p> She noted his first free use of her name</p><p>as she blushed and then answered: </p><p> “Very well, Neill, what do you suggest?”</p><p>CHAPTER IX </p><p>THE WHITE DEATH </p><p>THE next day the princes went to Wash- </p><p>ington by invitation to see the' sights </p><p>of the Capital City. Their suite was still </p><p>reserved, but McNeill breathed a little </p><p>more easily. The menace hanging over </p><p>Helen seemed less imminent though he </p><p>could neither dismiss nor fathom the sug- </p><p>gestion of Ten Shin that it had already fal- </p><p>len, and it had been an assertion rather than </p><p>a suggestion. But the days went by and she </p><p>appeared as blooming as ever, while Rems- </p><p>den himself completely regained his poise. </p><p> No national president was better safe-</p><p>guarded than was he night and day; the </p><p>protection extending to his stepdaughter. </p><p>He no longer affected to hold McNeill at a </p><p>distance. The Irishman’s polite covering </p><p>of the contempt in which he held Remsden </p><p>may have enraged him, but it also forced </p><p>him to at least an equal politeness, as a lion </p><p>will go through tricks it hates from fear of </p><p>the tamer and his whip. </p><p> There were few allusions to the claw.</p><p>Twice McNeill urged Remsden to do some- </p><p>thing toward the restoration of the claw, </p><p>to communicate with the princes at their </p><p>hotel in Washington, but, confident in the </p><p>power of his little army of protectors, he </p><p>stubbornly refused to discuss the question. </p><p> It was a week after the departure of</p><p>Liu Chi and his cousin that Helen made a </p><p>complaint that struck fear into the heart </p><p>of McNeill, ever alert for danger against </p><p>the girl he loved and, who, he had reason to </p><p>believe, returned his love. In the shadow </p><p>that he still feared hung over them all, he </p><p>170 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>had not spoken to her openly, but there </p><p>were a hundred signs that cheer even </p><p>despairing lovers, and McNeill was far from </p><p>being despondent. </p><p> He had definitely made up his mind to</p><p>force Remsden’s hand upon the princes’ </p><p>return, scheduled for the tenth day after </p><p>they left for Washington. Their banquet </p><p>had been set for the following evening and </p><p>all New York, especially that part of its </p><p>social center that had not been invited, </p><p>was agog over the rumored extravagance </p><p>of the affair. </p><p> It was to be an Arabian Nights enter-</p><p>tainment, it was said. There would be </p><p>magic wrought in more ways than one, </p><p>and all the fabled magnificence of Aladdin’s </p><p>gardens would fade before the spectacle </p><p>of the feast to be spread in the private suite </p><p>of their imperial highnesses as the society </p><p>columns, still secretly delighting in titles, </p><p>styled these two Chinamen who claimed to </p><p>be representatives of a new republic. </p><p>Guests had been asked to attend in Oriental </p><p>garb, and all the glamour of a fancy-dress </p><p>affair fascinated the fashion-writers and </p><p>stimulated the curiosity and envy of those </p><p>not fortunate enough to receive invitations. </p><p> Remsden, rather in fear than bravado,</p><p>McNeill thought, had accepted for himself </p><p>and Helen, and Neill himself had likewise </p><p>signified his intention of being present. </p><p>Helen and he were discussing costumes </p><p>when she presented her finger for his </p><p>inspection. </p><p> “It is numb, Neill,” she said. “First</p><p>it was the upper joint and now it is the </p><p>second—the same finger I pricked so badly </p><p>with those roses 1 thought you sent me. </p><p>I can’t bend it between those twT joints at </p><p>all. Look at it.” </p><p> As McNeill took the tapering finger a</p><p>strange fear gripped his heart. The men- </p><p>tion of the roses seemed to have promoted </p><p>the presentiment. Helen’s hand was white, </p><p>well kept, the texture of a gardenia petal, </p><p>though the tips showed the faint rose-hue </p><p>of perfect health. The index finger of the </p><p>right hand was the one she complained </p><p>about, and McNeill noticed that it was</p><p>subtly different from the rest. </p><p> He could bend it between the first and</p><p>second joints but there was no reflex action. </p><p>The nail lacked color and the pinkness of </p><p>the tip was entirely missing. The flesh </p><p>was unshriveled, but it had a frozen look; </p><p>it was like a finger carved in alabaster, </p><p>a finger of Galatea with all the rest of the </p><p>beautiful statue come to life. </p><p> A tiny, light-brown speck marked where</p><p>the sharp thorns of the American beauties </p><p>had punctured the skin and drawn blood. </p><p>There was a smaller mark lower down, </p><p>made in the same way. He strove to hide </p><p>his premonition. He dared not gaze into </p><p>her face, though presently he would have </p><p>to force himself to that inspection, he knew </p><p>quite well. </p><p> “How long have you noticed this?” he</p><p>asked. </p><p> “Since the morning after the thorns</p><p>pricked me,” she answered. “I thought </p><p>nothing of it, but it has steadily grown </p><p>worse. I asked Dr. Hastings about it and </p><p>he thought there might be some slight local </p><p>infection, but it has not swelled; it has </p><p>simply lost all sensation. He didn’t seem </p><p>to consider it very serious. It is my sewing </p><p>finger, and I do sew occasionally,” she </p><p>laughed, “so I have noticed it.” </p><p> “By the way,” asked McNeill casually,</p><p>though he made a strong effort to control </p><p>his voice, “you never found out who sent </p><p>you those roses?” </p><p> “No—no one has claimed the honor.</p><p>You,are quite sure you didn’t leave a stand- </p><p>ing order, Neill? It would be like you.” </p><p>“Quite sure. I wouldn’t worry about </p><p>this if I were you. It will probably pass.” </p><p>“Oh, I won’t worry about it. It is </p><p>probably a matter of circulation. I’ll have </p><p>to be more careful of my diet and cut off </p><p>candy I suppose.” </p><p> Neill laughed with her and then, de-</p><p>liberately forcing back all emotion, he pro- </p><p>ceeded to the test he dreaded. </p><p> “Won’t you play something?” he asked,</p><p>steadying his voice. </p><p> She went over to the piano and Neill</p><p>made a point of choosing something that she </p><p>must play by note. To aid her in this he </p><p>turned on the piano lights and then settled </p><p>himself in a chair that gave him a good </p><p>view of her face, turning it, as she did </p><p>occasionally, toward him. To the ordi- </p><p>nary observer there would have seemed </p><p>nothing out of the ordinary, save that the </p><p>face was very fair to look upon with its </p><p>perfect oval, the scarlet lips and the steady, </p><p>large eyes beneath curving, delicately pen- </p><p>ciled brows. It was at these latter that </p><p>Neill directed his closest attention, though </p><p>he managed to hide it from her, smiling </p><p>when he met her gaze. </p><p>The Dragon’s Claw </p><p>171 </p><p>PPJI WHEN he left her that night, his </p><p>|Oj|a nails had cut deeply into his palms. </p><p> “The cowards!” he said. “The</p><p>curs! And there is no remedy!” </p><p> At the hotel he made discreet inquiries</p><p>at the flower stand—inquiries sped by a </p><p>jovial talk and augmented with a liberal </p><p>tip. He traced the flowers. There had </p><p>been no special attempt to hide their source, </p><p>save from the lack of a card—a matter </p><p>easily explained by blaming an underling </p><p>secretary who would shoulder the responsi- </p><p>bility in case of inquiry. They had been </p><p>ordered by the secretary of the two Chinese </p><p>princes. A not too unusual compliment </p><p>from the distinguished foreigners to the </p><p>daughter of the president of the museum </p><p>whose soiree they had attended, and who </p><p>had been placed on the list of guests at their </p><p>banquet. </p><p> The flowers and their deadly thorns had</p><p>faded and long since been cast away, not </p><p>to be recovered. </p><p> But they had accomplished their purpose.</p><p>Achieved the deadly end of the fiends who </p><p>had sent them. How had the Chinese </p><p>scribe written? </p><p>A maid and a flower—both are beautiful. </p><p>Yet, when the wind blows from the East, </p><p>Lo, they perish as straws in the furnace! </p><p> The wind had blown from the East.</p><p>Helen was doomed. Doomed with the </p><p>living death, the White Death of China— </p><p>leprosy! </p><p> McNeill had suspected it in the numbing,</p><p>thorn-pricked finger, had confirmed it in </p><p>the slight but unmistakable leonine cast </p><p>of her brows, a suggestion of furrows and </p><p>puffed flesh that is one of the symptoms </p><p>of the disease. Leprosy was infectious </p><p>and the thorns had been impregnated by </p><p>the deadly virus.- The evidence was de- </p><p>stroyed, but the girl was sentenced to a loath- </p><p>some, ever encroaching dissolution, from </p><p>which there was no cure. Only a horrible </p><p>segregation under the law.</p><p> Black murder welled up in McNeill,</p><p>but he forced it down. Remsden was the </p><p>one to blame primarily and he, too, would </p><p>be hard hit, for Neill felt that he loved </p><p>his stepdaughter. As for the Orientals, </p><p>they had been hit and they had struck </p><p>back according to their lights. And Helen? </p><p>His clear brain reeled for a few moments </p><p>as he contemplated the awful fate ahead of </p><p>her—a fate that he determined to share </p><p>as nearly as he would be allowed. Yet </p><p>there must be, should be, a reckoning. </p><p>First doctors must be privately consulted, </p><p>Helen must be persuaded to see them on </p><p>some pretext, the stiffening of her finger, </p><p>the lack of circulation, but she must not be </p><p>allowed to suspect. It would drive a girl </p><p>of her vitality, her love of life, her sensitive- </p><p>ness, insane. </p><p> For himself he could only determine one</p><p>course. He could bluff up some evidence, </p><p>confront the princes. To what definite </p><p>avail he knew not but he must find some </p><p>vent for his own overmastering fury at the </p><p>unfair blow. And Remsden should not be </p><p>spared. His selfish pride should be humili- </p><p>ated. The claw should be returned. Per- </p><p>haps- </p><p>CHAPTER X </p><p>McNEILL </p><p>McNEILL had gone up in the private </p><p>elevator by sheer force of arms. </p><p>Hiding behind portieres, he had seized the </p><p>moment when a visitor descended from the </p><p>suites of Liu Chi and Ten Shin on the night </p><p>of their coming back from Washington, </p><p>waited until the man had disappeared and </p><p>the Chinese operator lounged waiting for a </p><p>call, and then he had come out, shoved the </p><p>muzzle of his gun against the Chinaman’s </p><p>blouse and ordered him to ascend. </p><p> The secretary' met him at the top and</p><p>to him McNeill applied the same treatment. </p><p>His lean face, bossed with muscles from his </p><p>set jaws, aided the imagination of the secre- </p><p>tary, who walked before him, death joggling </p><p>his ribs, into the anteroom and so into the </p><p>reception room where the two princes sat. </p><p>This time they were in conventional evening </p><p>dress, their faces strangely incongruous in </p><p>the setting.</p><p> McNeill faced them with a crisp demand</p><p>for an audience. </p><p> “Certainly,” assented Liu CM with the</p><p>-briefest glance at his cousin. “But there </p><p>was, there is no need for violence, Mr. </p><p>McNeill. You can put that pistol away. </p><p>We are quite adequately protected.” </p><p> “That is where you are mistaken,” said</p><p>Neill McNeill. “I do not represent vio- </p><p>lence, only force, and that is quite necessary. </p><p>And I am amply backed. I do not give a </p><p>poppy petal for my own life at the present </p><p>moment,” he wTent on, speaking in the </p><p>172 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Mandarin dialect, “save as it may accom- </p><p>plish an end and, if it is wiped out, there </p><p>are others who possess the actual evidence </p><p>I am about to present to you.” </p><p> Again there was that hint of a look, the</p><p>swift shuttling of agate eyes, but the </p><p>princes said nothing. </p><p> “I do not know how intimate you have</p><p>become with the workings of American </p><p>justice—” Neill went on, his voice as cold </p><p>as ever theirs had sounded—“the justice </p><p>that you spoke of adapting to your own </p><p>new republic. But there is such a thing </p><p>as international law and you have made the </p><p>mistake of supposing Mr. Remsden to be </p><p>purely a private citizen without influence </p><p>at Washington. You can easily assure </p><p>yourselves of this mistake by discussion </p><p>with your embassy, I am very certain. He </p><p>has a great deal of power. </p><p> “You affect to disdain the matter of the</p><p>claw in your affectation of new Chinese </p><p>policies which you are forced to adopt by </p><p>the trend of the times in China. You are </p><p>particularly anxious, not merely to remain </p><p>upon good terms with the United States </p><p>and her allies, but also to negotiate a loan </p><p>of considerable magnitude. This has not </p><p>been made public and my knowledge of it </p><p>should show you that I have not been idle </p><p>and that Mr. Remsden, from whom I ob- </p><p>tained the information, is in touch with </p><p>international affairs. </p><p> “You sent some roses to Miss Remsden.</p><p>I have the full evidence. You will be held </p><p>responsible for the actions of your secretary, </p><p>despite any denial he may make. The </p><p>thorns were impregnated with the virus of </p><p>leprosy, which was communicated to Miss </p><p>Remsden, as you hoped, by the pricking </p><p>of her hand. Those thorns have been sub- </p><p>jected to analysis, not thrown away, as </p><p>you expected. I know the symptoms of </p><p>leprosy. </p><p> “To that and the fact that the virus was</p><p>so strong as to bring out swiftly those </p><p>symptoms, is due Uie fact that the roses </p><p>were rescued in time. Your rank may keep </p><p>you from imprisonment, but your failure </p><p>to make the loan, the general loathing and</p><p>suspicion that will be cast upon all Chinese </p><p>diplomacy and personality will not serve </p><p>to make you popular with your govern- </p><p>ment. The evidence is in the hands of our </p><p>Secret Service, or will be turned over to </p><p>them either upon my order or in case I do </p><p>not leave these rooms unscathed or am in </p><p>any way interfered with. I have spoken.” </p><p>McNeill stopped talking, unable to tell </p><p>from those impassive masks what effect his </p><p>powerful indictment had made. It was </p><p>largely bluff. Remsden did have influence </p><p>and the wires had been busy ever since </p><p>he had disclosed to Remsden the state of </p><p>his daughter’s health. But they had been </p><p>unable to recover the roses. Still the cards </p><p>were hidden and the stakes were big. </p><p> “We will converse in English,” answered</p><p>Ten Shin imperturbably. “You have de- </p><p>livered your tirade, Mr. McNeill. If such </p><p>a misfortune has overtaken Miss Remsden, </p><p>we can understand your feelings and those </p><p>of her father, powerless as we may be to </p><p>avert them.” </p><p> “Remsden is not her father,” said</p><p>McNeill. “No blood of his is in her veins </p><p>and she is innocent of any complicity in his </p><p>affairs.” </p><p> “She is not his own daughter?”</p><p> “No.”</p><p> There was silence for several moments.</p><p>The two princes seemed to be, in some </p><p>occult way, transferring thoughts. </p><p> “You play a good game, Mr. McNeill,”</p><p>said Liu Chi at last. “And you place </p><p>your cards on the table, but they are not </p><p>face up, and some of them may be spurious. </p><p>I may say, without prejudice to our own </p><p>disclaimer in this matter, that the question </p><p>of Chinese vengeance lies largely in the </p><p>permanent punishment of offenders, even </p><p>to the third and fourth generation. The </p><p>fact that Miss Remsden is not of Howard </p><p>Remsden’s own blood is, I should imagine, </p><p>quite a factor. It is a pity it was not </p><p>known before—to Tao Chan, for example. </p><p> “As for your threats against us, we will</p><p>dismiss them as quite natural under the </p><p>circumstances. It is true that China is</p><p>anxious, through all her representatives, </p><p>to stand well with America; to prove to </p><p>your people that we are not utter bar- </p><p>barians, that we can even look at things </p><p>from the same standpoint of humanity, </p><p>the principles upon which your country is </p><p>so deeply founded. </p><p> “If you, with Mr. Remsden and Miss</p><p>Remsden, will attend the banquet to- </p><p>morrow evening—twenty-four hours will, </p><p>not alter the medical situation—we may be </p><p>able to assist you. We shall expect Mr. </p><p>Remsden to come half-way. We accept no </p><p>responsibility in this. We act merely as </p><p>mediators. We can understand that Mr. </p><p>The Dragon’s Claw </p><p>173 </p><p>Remsden wishes to, as we say in China, </p><p>save his face. We can perhaps arrange </p><p>that also. </p><p> “You will convey our sentiments to Mr.</p><p>Remsden. For yourself: Chinese doctors </p><p>have long been held up to the ridicule of </p><p>the western pharmacopoeia as believers in </p><p>charms, users of strange ingredients such </p><p>as those mentioned by the witches in </p><p>‘Macbeth.’ There may be merit in these </p><p>things. All diseases of the body are not </p><p>cured in the body. We are expecting a </p><p>notable guest. With us he holds great </p><p>merit as a herbalist though that is not his </p><p>profession. You shall meet him. And </p><p>remember—for every virus there is a </p><p>serum—not always generally known as yet, </p><p>but we Orientals have our secrets. We </p><p>can not prolong this interview. We have </p><p>an appointment.” </p><p> He clapped his hands and the secretary</p><p>appeared. </p><p> “Show in the gentlemen,” ordered Liu</p><p>Chi. </p><p> McNeill, hope affecting him like a palsy,</p><p>found himself acknowledging introductions </p><p>to several Americans, some of whom he </p><p>thought he knew. Soon he found himself </p><p>on the ground floor, his hope growing. </p><p>Could it be that the Chinese had found a </p><p>cure for leprosy? </p><p>CHAPTER XI </p><p>THE FORTUNE TELLER </p><p>THE banquet that was to be the talk of </p><p>New York for many a day had pro- </p><p>gressed with wonderful eclat. The costumes </p><p>of the guests, the elaborately bizarre </p><p>decorations, the strange music, the unusual </p><p>dishes spiced with a bountiful supply of </p><p>occidental vintages, the courtesy of the </p><p>hosts, the exotic atmosphere—all had made </p><p>the affair a success from the start. Rare </p><p>souvenirs, not to be priced,«had augmented </p><p>the entente cordiale. </p><p> With the cessation of gastronomies came</p><p>an entertainment of wizardry, of parlor </p><p>acrobatics, of indoor fireworks, until the</p><p>bewildered beholders were brought to the </p><p>tiring point. </p><p> Then, at the sound of a gong, a booth</p><p>was brought in—a hooded tent of silken </p><p>brocades, and Ten Shin arose. </p><p> “Much of which you have so courteously</p><p>shared with us tonight,” he said, “belongs </p><p>to the past—the passing China soon, we </p><p>hope, to be revivified with lessons learned </p><p>from American ingenuity and advancement. </p><p>But there is one element that always </p><p>appeals, particularly to the fair sex. That </p><p>element is the future. A member of our </p><p>little embassy has arrived today from China, </p><p>bringing important matters and, while he </p><p>has been too fatigued from his long and </p><p>accelerated journey to join us, he has con- </p><p>sented to give some manifestation of his </p><p>skill as a diviner.” </p><p> There was a murmur of anticipatory</p><p>delight and again the gong sounded. </p><p>From behind high curtains four Chinamen, </p><p>dressed in vivid emerald silk, brought </p><p>forward a palanquin of brightest scarlet </p><p>lacquer on which were illuminated golden </p><p>dragons in raised and lustrous metal work. </p><p>Six-clawed they were, noted McNeill, tense </p><p>with the sense of something pregnant. </p><p>This they placed by the tent and disap- </p><p>peared. </p><p> A weird chant, high pitched, nerve</p><p>thrilling, came from unseen musicians, </p><p>the shrill piping of the Chinese clarionet </p><p>and the twang of the gekken. The room </p><p>was very quiet and the lights grew gradually </p><p>dim. Then the scarlet curtains of the </p><p>palanquin glowed fiery red, faint streaks of </p><p>fight appeared through the folds of the tent </p><p>and a figure emerged from the carriage. </p><p>It was clad in silk of the vividest yellow </p><p>and the robes, McNeill noticed, as his fingers </p><p>gripped those of Helen next to him, were of </p><p>priestly cut. The figure was squat. In </p><p>its rotundity it might have been ludicrous, </p><p>save for a certain dignity that emanated </p><p>from it and because of that of the two </p><p>princely hosts. The face, projecting from </p><p>the folds of the hood, was that of a turtle— </p><p>was that of Tao Chan, high-priest of the </p><p>Hoang Lung. </p><p> McNeill was not surprized. But he</p><p>marked the effort Helen made to suppress</p><p>her feelings of astonishment and, perhaps, </p><p>of terror, though there was, as he assured </p><p>her, no fear of anything out of the way </p><p>happening there with so many American </p><p>guests present. Yet there was something </p><p>that thrilled him with a sense of hidden </p><p>power—of mystery. He glanced at Rems- </p><p>den. Remsden was staring at Tao Chan </p><p>as he might have looked at a basilisk, his </p><p>eyes projecting, his lower jaw sagging. </p><p> Tao Chan had evidently arrived with</p><p>the duplicate, leaving some excuse, or </p><p>174 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>perhaps a second replica, behind him. This </p><p>one was to be exchanged for the original. </p><p>Everybody’s face was to be satfed. Helen, </p><p>by Chinese drugs, to be cured, Remsden </p><p>to be left as president, and relieved of his </p><p>Damoclean fate. Only the museum would </p><p>suffer and be none the worse for it, thought </p><p>McNeill, knowing other spurious objects </p><p>venerated there as real. </p><p> He, Neill McNeill, had brought this</p><p>about by taking advantage of China’s </p><p>position as the Sick Man of Asia, looking </p><p>to America for aid. The princes had come </p><p>with a dual purpose—to get the claw and </p><p>to establish friendly relations. Which cause </p><p>they held the greater McNeill did not </p><p>venture to imagine. He did not care, </p><p>feeling certain that the evening would see </p><p>the end of their troubles unless Remsden </p><p>proved obstinate. In this case McNeill </p><p>promised himself that he would devise a </p><p>little pressure on his own account. </p><p> Ten Shin turned to the ladv on his right.</p><p>“Would you read the future?” he asked </p><p>her. “I am sure that for you it will be </p><p>rosy.” </p><p> Tao Chan had entered the little tent and</p><p>taken his seat before a stand of dark wood, </p><p>the legs formed of writhing dragons. There </p><p>was a dish in front of him. </p><p> “You will not be spirited away, I assure</p><p>you,” went on the prince. “I will not </p><p>guarantee that you will not be enchanted, </p><p>but turn about is fair play.” </p><p> The guest laughed nervously at his</p><p>raillery but consented to enter the tent. </p><p>The curtains closed and there was only </p><p>a low murmur to be heard, drowned largely </p><p>by the rising notes of the orchestra. In </p><p>less than two minutes the woman came out. </p><p>' “Your wizard is a flatterer, prince,” she </p><p>said. “I wish I could believe half he </p><p>promised, though he does not speak very </p><p>good English.” </p><p> “He has learned it for the occasion,”</p><p>said Ten Shin gravely. </p><p> Liu Chi next asked his dinner partner</p><p>and she disappeared. McNeill could hear</p><p>the first visitant answering questions. </p><p> “I can’t describe it,” she replied. “Wait</p><p>till your turn. He showed me a funny plate </p><p>first and then—I don’t remember really </p><p>what happened. It was all over so quickly, </p><p>but he told me a lot of strange things that </p><p>might come true. I hope so.” </p><p> “Chinese hypnotism,” whispered McNeill</p><p>to Helen under cover of the chatter. “He </p><p>read her own wishes. It will be your turn </p><p>next. Don’t be afraid. It is going to help </p><p>us. I can guess what they are after.” </p><p> At Liu Chi’s request Helen went into the</p><p> booth, remaining there a little longer than</p><p> the rest. When she came out she was</p><p> pale, and McNeill handed her a glass of</p><p> wine.</p><p> “Don’t talk now,” he said. “Tell us</p><p>later.” </p><p> , She nodded brightly at him.</p><p> “It sounded like good news,” she said.</p><p> Some of the fairer guests refused; others</p><p> accepted and the novelty began to wane.</p><p> Tao Chan pleaded, or pretended to plead,</p><p> exhaustion, and withdrew in the palanquin.</p><p> Then the lights went up. Ten Shin arose</p><p> with a toast to the United States and</p><p> another orchestra, typically American,</p><p> broke spiritedly into the “Star Spangled</p><p> Banner.” The brilliant assemblage rose.</p><p> As the strains died, Liu Chi made his</p><p> peroration.</p><p> “Heliogabalus,” he said, “smothered his</p><p> guests to death with rose petals. Tonight it</p><p> is my cousin and myself who are smothered</p><p> with your good-will, but not to death.</p><p> And, though roses grow in China, we have a</p><p> more typical flower that bears the charm of</p><p> sweet forgetfulness—the faculty of dream-</p><p> less sleep. The lotus! May its petals</p><p> bring to all of'you that boon to end the</p><p> night.”</p><p> The canopy above the table divided</p><p>and a shower of fragrant blossoms fell </p><p>while all the room was filled with mystical </p><p>perfume. Laughing, congratulating, the </p><p>guests departed, the princes standing to bid </p><p>them farewell.</p><p> “We shall see you once more before</p><p>we leave, I hope,” said Ten Shin to McNeill </p><p>and Helen. Then as they passed on he </p><p>touched Remsden on the arm. </p><p> “A word with you, sir,” he said pleas-</p><p> antly, and envious guests marked Remsden</p><p> as one given spacial favors.</p><p>□ THE two waited for Remsden in </p><p>the anteroom. He came to them </p><p>at last with the face of one who has </p><p>seen his own ghost—his features twisted </p><p>like a man who has suffered a stroke. All </p><p>the way back to the limousine he did not </p><p>speak but plucked clumsily at his own </p><p>fingers. At the house he achieved speech </p><p>with an effort, as if his lingual muscles had </p><p>suffered paralysis. </p><p>The Dragon’s Claw </p><p>175 </p><p> “Neill and I will join you when you have</p><p>taken off your wraps, Helen,” he said. </p><p> She looked anxiously at him and then</p><p>nodded. </p><p> “In the drawing-room,” she replied.</p><p> The men went into the library. Remsden</p><p>poured brandy and gulped it down. Then </p><p>he sank into the cushions of a big chair </p><p>like a man of ninety. </p><p> “What is the matter with Helen, Neill?”</p><p>he asked thickly. </p><p> “Leprosy,” answered McNeill bluntly.</p><p>Remsden clawed at the arms of the chair, </p><p>gasping for breath and speech. </p><p> “My God!” he said. “I never thought—</p><p>Ten Shin said—he said that—as a bruised </p><p>plum is to a rotten fruit, as a stained pearl to </p><p>a bowl of slime, so should my punishment </p><p>be compared to hers. Oh, my God, Neill!” </p><p> “Brace up,” snapped McNeill. “What</p><p>else did he say? About the claw?” </p><p> “I am to show it him at the museum</p><p>tomorrow—Tao Chan I mean. He is to </p><p>handle it. The princes will be there. </p><p>We—we may adjust matters. I do not </p><p>know. I can not trust them. I must see </p><p>Helen.” </p><p> McNeill guessed what the adjustment</p><p>would be. A little legerdemain, such as </p><p>Wilson had shown in the desert, this time </p><p>with Tao Chan as the prestidigitator. </p><p>But had Remsden already been inoculated? </p><p>How was he to be cured? And Helen? </p><p> “There are various degrees of leprosy,</p><p>of course,” he said. “Do you fancy that </p><p>you are already infected?” </p><p> Remsden nodded.</p><p> “I know it,” he groaned. “Something</p><p>pricked my palm when I shook hands </p><p>with Ten Shin, and he smiled when I </p><p>started. But Helen—Helen has an anti- </p><p>dote. I shall receive one tomorrow</p><p>after-” </p><p> “The claws are exchanged,” supplied</p><p>McNeill. “Let us go into the drawing- </p><p>room.” </p><p> They found the girl waiting and McNeill,</p><p>answering a plea in Remsden’s eyes, put </p><p>the question to her: </p><p> “What happened in the tent? I can</p><p>imagine that Tao Chan hypnotized you </p><p>and questioned you. By so doing he </p><p>could confirm my statement to the princes </p><p>of your innocence in the stealing and sub- </p><p>stitution of the claw. But what did he say </p><p>that you remember?” </p><p> “Why he told me that I had been suffering</p><p>from some trouble with my hands but </p><p>that I should soon be entirely well again. </p><p>He gave me this.” </p><p> She showed a tiny phial of gray jade</p><p>wonderfully carven in the shape of a dragon </p><p>and stoppered with a dragon’s claw of gold </p><p>that held a tiny ball of crystal. Within </p><p>were some pellets of dull orange color. </p><p> “These are to be taken one every hour,”</p><p>she said, “dissolved in hot water. I have </p><p>already taken one and I can feel a tingling </p><p>in my numb finger.” </p><p> She held it out for inspection. Remsden</p><p>looked at it with a shudder. </p><p> “And he said that Mr. Remsden was in</p><p>danger of sickness that was to be averted </p><p>by the medicine that he, Tao Chan, would </p><p>give him tomorrow. Are you to see him </p><p>tomorrow?” </p><p> “Yes,” answered Remsden. “Thank</p><p>God I am. Good night, you two. Good </p><p>night.” </p><p> They watched him leave the room, feeble,</p><p>bowed, a man old before his time. </p><p> Then youth turned to youth.</p><p> Our Camp-Fire came into being May 5, 1912, with our June issue, and since then</p><p>its fire has never died down. Many have gathered about it and they are of all classes </p><p>and degrees, high and low, rich and poor, adventurers and stay-at-homes, and from all </p><p>parrs of the earth. Some whose voices we used to know have taken the Long Trail </p><p>and are heard no more, but they are still memories among us, and new voices are </p><p>heard, and welcomed. </p><p> We are drawn together by a common liking for the strong, clean things of out-of-</p><p>doors, for word from the earth’s far places, for man in action instead of caged by cir- </p><p>cumstance. The spirit of adventure lives in all men; the rest is chance. </p><p> But something besides a common interest holds us together. Somehow a real com-</p><p>radeship h;is grown up among us. Men can not thus meet and talk together without </p><p>growing into friendlier relations; many a time does one of us come to the rest for facts </p><p>and guidance; many a close personal friendship has our Camp-Fire built up between </p><p>two men who had never met; often has it proved an open sesame between strangers </p><p>in a far land. </p><p> Perhaps our Camp-Fire is even a little more. Perhaps it is a bit of leaven working</p><p>gently among those of different station toward the fuller and more human understand- </p><p>ing and sympathy that will some day bring to man the real democracy and brotherhood </p><p>he seeks. Few indeed are the agencies that bring together on a friendly footing so many </p><p>and such great extremes as here. And we are numbered by the hundred thousand now. </p><p> If you arc comc to our Camp-Fire for the first time and find you like the things we</p><p>like, join us and find yourself very welcome. There is no obligation except ordinary </p><p>manliness, no forms or ceremonies, no dues, no officers, no anything except men and </p><p>women gathered for interest and friendliness. Your desire to join makes you a member. </p><p>as “Unde Frank” Huston has put it, to </p><p>press-agenting. Of course he was press- </p><p>agented; even his best friends must admit </p><p>that. But whether it was to a degree that </p><p>really affected the validity of his claim to </p><p>came is another matter and I don’t believe </p><p>we want to start another Drannan discus- </p><p>sion at Camp-Fire. </p><p>Elyria, Ohio. </p><p> I have just been reading about Custer, Buffalo</p><p>Bill and Calamity Jane. There has been so much </p><p>bunk written and told concerning Custer, Reno, </p><p>Buffalo Bill, etc., that I thought it might be that </p><p>you would like to read a more truthful account con- </p><p>cerning those men.</p><p> My regiment, the 7th U. S. Infantry, was ordered</p><p>into the fight where Custer fell, but the order being </p><p>counlcrmanded, the 7th Cavalry, Custer’s com- </p><p>mand, was ordered into the fight while the 7th </p><p>Infantry were detailed to guard the wagon-train. </p><p>Reno was not to blame for the massacre of Custer </p><p>and his men, for Reno obeyed Custer’s orders as </p><p>well as he could under the circumstances, while </p><p>Custer, disobeying his own orders, caused the </p><p>deaths of himself and his men. Custer had been </p><p>COME more testimony concerning the </p><p>^ Custer Massacre, from a comrade who </p><p>was formerly of the 7 th Infantry, which </p><p>barely missed being in the fight itself. </p><p> What Dr. Arnold said about Buffalo</p><p>Bill was mild enough in tone but, well, </p><p>takes the general point of view that to a </p><p>certain degree Buffalo Bill’s fame was due, </p><p>The Camp-Fire	177</p><p>vvamed for days before that the Indians were out </p><p>in very great numbers, but, paying no attention </p><p>to his scouts, he ordered Reno to go down the </p><p>Little Big Horn a ways, cross over, and. after </p><p>circling around to the back of the Indians’ camp, </p><p>to fire a signal shot, upon which Custer and his </p><p>men were to charge upon the camp from the front. </p><p>Custer, however, bull-headed as ever, never waited </p><p>for Reno to get back of the camp and fire the signal </p><p>shot, but dashed right in, when, as Chief Gall said </p><p>when showing a party over the field in 1886, the </p><p>Indians were as thick as the leaves of the forest, </p><p>springing up from the ground and in lots of in- </p><p>stances clubbing the cavalrymen off from their horses. </p><p>(''USTER went into the fight with long hair, all </p><p>stories to the contrary, and it is no doubt all </p><p>bosh about his having committed suicide. He was </p><p>certainly killed by either Rain-in-the-Face or some </p><p>other Indian. It was a massacre, all right, for </p><p>their carbines were mostly fastened to their saddles </p><p>and, their horses breaking away, they were left </p><p>with only a few carbines, about a half dozen sabers </p><p>and their revolvers with which to defend them- </p><p>selves. </p><p> In the meantime Reno and his men were sur-</p><p>rounded on a hill by Indians, and the 7th Infantry </p><p>and a small outfit of cavalry, the 8th, if I remember </p><p>right, rescued Reno and his men. Afterward the </p><p>7th Infantry and the 8th Cavalry helped to bury </p><p>Custer and his men. Reno would have been wiped </p><p>out with his men if they had not been rescued just </p><p>in time. </p><p>gUFFALO BILL used to scout with my regiment </p><p>and ... I used to know Calamity Jane. Calamity </p><p>Jane was certainly a very noted woman. She was </p><p>full of life and vigor, and when she looked at a </p><p>person her eyes would almost bore holes through </p><p>them.—Dr. William E. Arnold (formerly Musi- </p><p>cian, Co. B, 7th Infantry, U. S. A.) </p><p>A WORD from Harold A. Lamb in con- </p><p>nection with his story in this issue: </p><p>New York. </p><p> A few points about “Said Afzel’s Elephant.” It</p><p>may seem improbable that three men could do </p><p>what Abdul Dost and bis friends tackled. In India </p><p>at that time, however, a noble from the court trav- </p><p>eled with a Large following of slaves, personal </p><p>attendants, eunuchs, wives, buffoons, liafis, or </p><p>poem-readers, bearers, etc. </p><p>"pEW of such gentry were fighting men by inclina-</p><p>tion or training. And even today the hillmen </p><p>of Afghanistan such as the Afridis are excellent </p><p>combatants when so inclined. At that time tribal </p><p>warfare was the rule and the hillmen were skilled </p><p>in weapons. They had to be. </p><p> As to Said Afzel. The character of the opium-</p><p>using poet is not overdrawn. Drugs of varied sort </p><p>were in general use, and it was the fashion to remaiff </p><p>stupefied for certain lengths of time. The Rajputs </p><p>were addicted to opium in very large quantities. </p><p>One passage in the memoirs of Baber relates tnat </p><p>he kept sober at a drinking party of his friencis in </p><p>order to see what the bout world be like. He </p><p>watched them drink wine, then change to bhang </p><p>and distilled spirits, ending up with ooium and </p><p>more wine until “they became senseless or began </p><p> 12</p><p>to commit all manner of follies, whereupon I had </p><p>myself carried out.” </p><p>A GOOD deal has been written of the treasure </p><p>of the Moghuls. This was hardly so very </p><p>great in money, but consisted of enormous quan- </p><p>tities of jewels, especially diamonds and rubies, </p><p>horses, cloth-of-gold, etc. The amount of an </p><p>amir’s treasure measured the number of fighting- </p><p>men he could buy; hence the possession of a store </p><p>of riches as in this story was more valuable to an </p><p>ambitious noble than a small kingdom.—H. A. </p><p>Lamb. </p><p>THANKS to our comrade Ira A. Thomp- </p><p>son of El Paso I have a copy of “Poi- </p><p>sonous Animals of the Desert,” by Charles </p><p>T. Vorhies, which is Bulletin No. 83 of the </p><p>Agricultural Experiment Station, College </p><p>of Agriculture, University of Arizona, </p><p>Tucson, Arizona. The Bulletins, Timely </p><p>Hints and Reports of this Station will be </p><p>sent free to all who apply. Among other </p><p>things, it seems to give us a final and </p><p>authoritative decision on our old, old </p><p>friend, the Gila Monster. It is poisonous, </p><p>but the effects ol its bite are variable and </p><p>there seems to be no established case of </p><p>the death of a hun an being from its bite. </p><p> Here is Mr. Thompson’s letter:</p><p>El Paso, Texas. </p><p> In your issue of August 18th you list 13 kinds of</p><p>rattlesnakes. </p><p> As Arizona '? the home of J1 kinds, I take-the</p><p>liberty to send you Lins booklet issued by Arizona </p><p>State University, wtn :n state' there are 19 known </p><p>varieties of rattlesnakes, 4 of which inhabit </p><p>U. S. A. and 11 of these art found in Arizona. </p><p>My .45 Colt (single-action, i' you please) has </p><p>finished many a rattler. </p><p> Re coral snake. A Mexican woman at a mine</p><p>about 60 miles south of the line lived abou*- 10 or </p><p>15 minutes after being bitten by coral snake. </p><p> You will also find something about Mr. Gila</p><p>Monster. Nothing like the bunk one sometimes </p><p>reads in stories, nor for that matter is it much like </p><p>the stuff I have handed out to entertain some of </p><p>the new comers, who as a rule will believe the lies </p><p>but not the truth.—Ika A. Thompson. </p><p> And here is a quotation from the Bul-</p><p>letin: </p><p> Just one other poisonous reptile belongs to our</p><p>fauna—the Gila Monster (Heloderma suspectum, </p><p>cover cut). This and a closely related species, </p><p>Heloderma horridum, found only in Mexico, are </p><p>the only poisonous lizards in the world. Abso- </p><p>lutely no other lizards (these including the so-called </p><p>“horned toad?”) are poisonous. The Gila Mon- </p><p>ster has Dois*&gt;; -glands, but in the lower instead </p><p>a he upper jaw, the secretion oozing out between </p><p>the teeth and the lower Ups. It has no poison </p><p>fang&lt; however, and therefore no definite mechan- </p><p>ism for •j’-dbly injecting poison with a stroke as </p><p>does the rattlesnake. It will snap and bite if </p><p>Adventure </p><p>178 </p><p>irritated, and will cling like a bulldog when it gets </p><p>hold, and poison may enter the wounds made by </p><p>its numerous small sharp teeth as a result of the </p><p>tenacious grip of the animal. </p><p>'T'HE effects of its bite are variable, owing doubt- </p><p>less to the impcrfect application of the venom- </p><p>ous saliva. Though some reports have it that </p><p>human deaths have resulted from the bite of this </p><p>animal, these reports arc but hearsay and fade away </p><p>to nothing upon investigation. The writer is in- </p><p>debted to a reputable physician of Tucson who has </p><p>made considerable effort to authenticate a single </p><p>case of death caused by the Gila Monster, and has </p><p>failed to do so. An exhaustive report on “The </p><p>Venom of Hcloderma,” by Leo Loeb, published </p><p>by the Carnegie Institution, as well as the re- </p><p>searches of other investigators, shows that the </p><p>venom produces fatal results in various small ani- </p><p>mals, such as rats, mice, frogs, guinea pigs, etc. </p><p>As to effects on man, we find no local data to dis- </p><p>countenance the following statement from Loeb’s </p><p>report: </p><p>“ NJO DEATH of a human being has come to our </p><p>knowledge that can be attributed to the bite </p><p>of a Gila Monster. A bite from this animal is in </p><p>man cither followed by no symptoms at all or by </p><p>a local swelling, perhaps extending to the shoulder, </p><p>if the bite affected the upper extremity. In </p><p>all the reports concerning the local effect of the </p><p>bite of the Ileloderma in man, mention is made </p><p>of the rapid appcarancc of swelling and hcm- </p><p>morrhagic discoloration of the skin at the site of </p><p>injury. We found that when fresh venom was </p><p>injected subcutaneously into an animal, no swelling </p><p>or hemorrhage .appeared at the site of injection; </p><p>and when venom was injected intramuscularly, no </p><p>hemorrhage was noted.....It is impossible, </p><p>however, to absolutely rule out mechanical injury </p><p>as a factor in causing the appearance of these local </p><p>symptoms when an individual is bitten by a Helo- </p><p>derma. The animal has very powerful jaws and </p><p>its bite would easily bruise a large area of flesh and </p><p>skin. When the animal bites it clings tenaciously, </p><p>and in endeavoring to extricate a wounded part of </p><p>the injury might easily be increased." </p><p>WHETHER potassium permanganate is destruc- </p><p>tive to Helodcrman venom is not determined. </p><p>Therefore we can not recommend it as of value </p><p>in case of a bite by this animal. We would only </p><p>suggest releasing the bitten part as rapidly and</p><p>yet as coolly and carefully as possible and then </p><p>seeking a physician, perhaps first inducing some </p><p>bleeding and then washing the wound with an anti- </p><p>septic. The venom is not to be regarded as deadly </p><p>to man, hence there is no need for hysterical fear. </p><p> In closing on Heloderma we would suggest that</p><p>there is no good reason for remorselessly slaying </p><p>every Gila Monster encountered. Rather should wc </p><p>class it with the road runner and the jxxcary as </p><p>unique features of our fauna, a part of the charac- </p><p>teristic landscape of Arizona, like the giant cactus </p><p>among the flora of the State. </p><p> Also, in addition to a detailed statement</p><p>of treatment for snake-bite and poisonous </p><p>insect bites the Bulletin takes up another </p><p>subject that has produced much argument </p><p>—the “hydrophobia skunk.” Its conclu- </p><p>sion is that there is no particular species of </p><p>skunk which can be designated as the </p><p>“hydrophobia skunk,” but that skunks </p><p>are rather more likely to bite sleepers than </p><p>are coyotes, wolves and dogs and that </p><p>perhaps a larger proportion of bites from </p><p>skunks produce rabies. Mr. Vorhies arrives </p><p>at one “unavoidable conclusion”—in case </p><p>of skunk-bite take the Pasteur treatment. </p><p>WHEN Captain Smith wrote the fol- </p><p>lowing letter he was in France. </p><p>Some of you are sure to give him the in- </p><p>formation he wants, so will he, when he </p><p>sees this, kindly give us his home address </p><p>so I can forward letters to him? </p><p>Angers, France. </p><p> I noticed in one of your recent numbers a request</p><p>for a poem from some party, and one of your </p><p>other readers had supplied him with it, through </p><p>your Camp-Fire pages. A number of years ago </p><p>I read a poem called “The Ballad of Boastful Bill” </p><p>in a book of cow-country ditties, and have never </p><p>been able to get a copy of it since. All I can </p><p>remember of it is as follows: </p><p> THE BALLAD OF BOASTFUL BILL</p><p> At a cow camp on the Gila,</p><p> One sweet morning, long ago,</p><p> Ten of us was throwed right freely</p><p> By a hoss from Idaho.</p><p> And it looked as though he’d go a begging</p><p> For a man to bust his pride,</p><p> Till a-hitching up one legging,</p><p> Boastful Bill cut loose an’ cried:</p><p> “I’m an ornery proposition for to hurt,</p><p> I fulfill my earthly mission with a quirt.</p><p> I can ride the highest liver</p><p> Twixt the Gulf and Powder River,</p><p> An’ I’ll ride this thing as easy as I’d flirt.”</p><p> If any of you readers can supply the balance of</p><p>this I would feel obliged. I will watch your Camp- </p><p>Fire pages for results. Thanking you for your favor. </p><p>Adios.—Herbert R. Smjth, Capt. Signal Corps. </p><p> AS TO water-proof coating, here’s a</p><p> receipt:</p><p>Mound House, Nevada. </p><p> I see in the last “Ask Adventure” that Mer—</p><p>(can’t recall the name now) gives parrafine and </p><p>benzine as a waterproofing mixture. I would like </p><p>to say that beeswax dissolved in turpentine beats </p><p>this all hollow. I also want to say for the benefit </p><p>of the uninitiated that any waterproofing compound </p><p>should be applied to canvas in more than one coat </p><p>for the best result. Far better to take a thinner </p><p>mixture and use it twice.—Joseph Gray. </p><p>TN THE language of the poet, you can </p><p>search me. Remember the strange </p><p>manuscript picked up in a bottle on the </p><p>Nova Scotian coast, which, passed on to </p><p>The Camp-Fire	179</p><p>Camp-Fire, brought forth a number of </p><p>interesting translations? Yes, and remem- </p><p>ber that Edgar Young confessed he and </p><p>a friend had thrown it overboard in the </p><p>South Atlantic as a hoax? Well, that </p><p>seems to settle it, doesn’t it? Only it </p><p>doesn’t. For the original sender writes </p><p>indignantly that Young’s message could </p><p>not be the one he has because the latter </p><p>was found before the date on which the </p><p>hoax was pulled off. </p><p> Here’s the letter from our Nova Scotian</p><p>comrade—at least such part of it as it </p><p>seems right to make public. I pointed out </p><p>to the writer that Edgar Young’s address </p><p>appears in every issue of the magazine. </p><p>-, Nova Scotia. </p><p> While not disputing Edgar Young’s veracity or</p><p>intentions, I note that he says he did this in 1910 </p><p>and 1 was a miner full grown and earning men’s </p><p>wages at a coal-face at that time. It was in 1909- </p><p>1911 we Nova Scotia miners had our twenty-two </p><p>months’.strike for U. M. W. recognition. </p><p>KJ OW to the point I can not understand. Edgar </p><p> Young says he wrote a message purporting to</p><p>be from Hlackbume in 1910. Well, this old chart </p><p>was found when I was a school kid and I left school </p><p>when 16, and am 36 years old now. My uncle </p><p>died in 1894 and he and a chum found this old </p><p>bottle in 1889. So how does that rhyme with </p><p>Comrade Young’s statement? </p><p> It’s queer that there are two old - about</p><p>the !jcality of the bay and rivers indicated; also </p><p>a good clear spring in a line with that tree and </p><p>the anchorage; also that tree, which I have found </p><p>and identified—by markings, which are similar </p><p>to some on the old chart which Edgar Young no </p><p>doubt can describe. What I can not understand </p><p>is how he wrote it in 1910 and it was found in </p><p>1889, as I have ascertained by going over some files </p><p>of old letters. </p><p>JsJOW, I’m not boosting this thing for publicity. </p><p> I’m on the “lone” trail in this thing and have</p><p>reason to believe that there is a rich find for some </p><p>one. If, however, Edgar Young can describe that </p><p>old chart and explain how it was written in 1910 </p><p>and found in lhe Fall of 1889; also how I knew of </p><p>it and took it to the high school principal here when</p><p>a school kid of 14 or so and was a man of 27 when </p><p>it was written, that’s too psychological for me to </p><p>comprehend. I would like to get hold of that old </p><p>account of that pirate Hlackbume as I think I’ve </p><p>located Lhe old fellow’s favorite rendezvous. </p><p> I wonder if Edgar Young can tell me where to</p><p>get it. Also I’d like to correspond with him to see </p><p>if he can fully describe the locality drawn on that </p><p>chart in my possession. If his. claim is authentic </p><p>and true, then the whole thing is a hoax perpe- </p><p>trated and invented for the purpose of misleading </p><p>and deceiving. It certainly accomplished its pur- </p><p>pose if so, for I know I’ve spent hours untold in </p><p>corresponding about it and had offers to buy it </p><p>from folks who could decipher part of it and not </p><p>all (so they said), but were particularly anxious to </p><p>see the original. </p><p> This has been no joke in our family.---.</p><p> And here is Edgar Young’s reply:</p><p> Brooklyn.</p><p> The first thing that occurred to me when I read</p><p>what that fellow had to say about the Capitan </p><p>Blackbume manuscript was to shut up like a clam. </p><p>He has his dates wrong and seems set on making </p><p>a liar out of me. My first decision was to let that </p><p>MS. remain a mystery and I was advised by a </p><p>close friend to say nothing about it, even if I had </p><p>written it. Fate seems to be mixed up in this and </p><p>I was unable to follow my better judgment and </p><p>remain silent. </p><p>'"THERE happens to be living proof to support the </p><p>details I gave you in the former letter. This </p><p>is the man who was with me and helped concoct </p><p>the MS. Right here a funny tiling comes in. </p><p>This man and 1 parted in anger in Nicaragua in </p><p>1913 and have not spoken or written each other </p><p>since. The cause of our disagreement was very </p><p>slight and I have always kept track of him through ~ </p><p>others, for he was a true-blue pal, one of the only </p><p>two I met up with. We made the trip from Colon </p><p>down the cast coast of South America and back </p><p>up the other side, working in all the countries en </p><p>route. He remained to work in Ecuador and I </p><p>came to Panama to work for the Panama Railroad </p><p>until he arrived. We both went to Nicaragua, </p><p>where we worked as officials of the National Rail- </p><p>ways, I as auditor and he as general storekeeper. </p><p>We separated after some seven months. </p><p> He blew up first and came to New York and I</p><p>blew up later and came to San Francisco. Later </p><p>he returned to Panama and went into the con-</p><p>tracting business and was civil engineer for some </p><p>Panama Government work. I understand he is </p><p>now employed by the Panama Railway, or was the </p><p>last time 1 asked about him. I am pretty sure he </p><p>has kept track of me, in fact, 1 know he has, for </p><p>a friend has passed along comments he has made </p><p>on stories of mine that appeared in magazines. </p><p>I POSSIBLY owe him an apology for the words </p><p> passed between us in Nicaragua, for he was</p><p>really trying to keep me from making a- fool </p><p>out of mvself, which I later did. But I do not </p><p>intend to write him an apology now at the present </p><p>time to get him to uphold a statement in regard </p><p>to a fool MS. we placed in a bottle in 1910. Even - </p><p>if I did, proof obtained in this manner would be </p><p>worthless. The best tiling I can think of is to run </p><p>the explanation I have given in Camp-Fire and </p><p>right with it run the later letter of the man who </p><p>has the MS. at the present time which makes a </p><p>liar out of me. I am willing to appear in the </p><p>role he has placed me. I am pretty sure that- </p><p>will come forward with a statement if he happens </p><p>to see the letters, which he no doubt will see. If </p><p>he does not, I will still be satisfied. However, I </p><p>feel pretty sure he will not let that fellow put the </p><p>Kobie on me. </p><p>TN THE meantime I have framed the card in a </p><p> little frame I got at the five-and-ten and have</p><p>it hanging on Lhe wall over my desk. I remember </p><p>the exact words that passed when lhe MS. was </p><p>wrillen. Part was writlen by each of us. I </p><p>made the arrow pointing down stream,-made </p><p>the little house in the comer and the anchor. I </p><p>i8o </p><p>Adventure </p><p>don’t remember whether we showed.it to Captain </p><p>Funcke or not. If we did he may see the discus- </p><p>sion and come forward with further corroboration. </p><p>He will no doubt remember the two strange pas- </p><p>sengers who refused to eat on the latter end of the </p><p>voyage and whom he came to visit in the room of </p><p>the best hotel in Rio after we landed, in company </p><p>with a ship’s chandler of the city. </p><p> It may be that some of the shipmates of this</p><p>man’s uncle will write in and stale that the dates </p><p>he has are in error, for they certainly arc. I was </p><p>bom in 1883 and I am sure I did not write that </p><p>before I was six years old. I am saying it was </p><p>written with a Waterman's fountain-pen bought </p><p>from the Panama Railroad newsstand at Gatun, </p><p>of which Mrs. Nolte was in charge, on board the </p><p>good ship Merkador between the 12th and 31st of </p><p>December, 1910, and thrown overboard between </p><p>Barbados and Rio. </p><p> These are the facts. If proof comes naturally,</p><p>let it come. I have always been something of a </p><p>fatalist. I don’t know what reason Fate had for </p><p>making me get mixed up in this. From present </p><p>circumstances it looks as if she wanted to make </p><p>a liar out of me. It may be that the MS. - </p><p>and I wrote was intended to bring us together </p><p>after we had split up. Quien sabc? and again </p><p>Quien sabc? </p><p>JJIGHT here I rest my case. If you wish to use </p><p>this letter, please use blank spaces for the </p><p>names of-and-. For the love of M iguel. </p><p>what reason would I have to claim authorship of </p><p>a MS. the sea has returned? Don't the editors </p><p>return enough of them? That’s a good one! “Due </p><p>to the supply of MSS. we have on hand from the </p><p>Mermen and Mermaids, we herewith return as </p><p>unavailable, etc.” </p><p> It has just occurred to me that......Let's</p><p>find out. Let’s get some dope on the other bottles </p><p>that were thrown over at the same time and some </p><p>of which I am sure have been found. Perhaps the </p><p>ink, paper, etc, of these other messages contain </p><p>proof. —I am Idling the truth and have nothing to </p><p>fear from later developments.—Edgar Young. </p><p> So there we are—or aren’t. As I said</p><p>in the beginning, you can search me. Two </p><p>documents instead of one? Perhaps. A </p><p>scheme to arouse interest and capital in a </p><p>treasure-hunt? Doesn’t sound so on the </p><p>face of it. Quite a number of possible </p><p>solutions offer themselves but no one of </p><p>them proves itself. </p><p> But I’m not holding out on you, except,</p><p>of course, the man’s name and address, </p><p>which he gave me in confidence. I can </p><p>add only the fact that I never met him </p><p>and know no more about him than _you </p><p>do, and the minor detail that when Edgar </p><p>Young first wrote me that he had set that </p><p>bottle adrift I replied asking whether he </p><p>were kidding me and was assured that he </p><p>was not. If the two men have corresponded </p><p>since the above letters, I have not heard </p><p>the results. But I’m writing to both and </p><p>asking, so maybe there’ll be more news </p><p>later. </p><p> At least let’s hope that Edgar Young’s</p><p>old pal comes across. The kind of man </p><p>Mr. Young describes would hardly fail </p><p>to toe the scratch in such a case if it comes </p><p>to his attention._ </p><p>OWING to something I don’t remem- </p><p>ber but which was quite likely my </p><p>own fault, Henry Leverage’s introduction </p><p>to Camp-Fire doesn’t reach us in the same </p><p>issue with our first story from him, but be </p><p>easy on me and meet him now. If there are </p><p>any of the old Karluk men among us they </p><p>can write Mr. Leverage in care of this </p><p>office. </p><p>New York. </p><p> In introducing myself to the Camp-Fire, I’m</p><p>going to lie down, fill up my old cord-wrapped pipe, </p><p>reach for a brand and between pulls, say: </p><p> “The Iron Dollar,” my first story to sell to</p><p>Adventure, is almost fact. I can see the picture </p><p>now, coming home to San Francisco. A dirty, </p><p>sawed-off whaler—twenty-four in the fo’cas’le— </p><p>and only two American-born among them. </p><p> We had beans for all three meals over the period</p><p>of two months. Beans—topped with salt-horse. </p><p>The crew started promising certain things which </p><p>were gomg to happen to the skipper. They sharp- </p><p>ened knives and mentioned the hrst time they got </p><p>the old man ashore.</p><p>WE LANDED and all hands went with the skip- </p><p>per into the nearest dive—it was called the </p><p>"Blubber Room” in those days. He bought a </p><p>round of steam beers, everybody shook hands with </p><p>him. and he went out—without a knife in his back. </p><p> I dug in my dungaree trousers, fished forth a</p><p>five-dollar gold-piece, and offered to buy a square </p><p>meal. Twenty-three whalemen followed me into </p><p>The Home Dairy Restaurant. They glanced at </p><p>the menu card, coughed, stared at the wall where </p><p>signs hung inscribed: “Roast-Becf, Very Rare; </p><p>“Chicken Fricasee”; “Liver and Bacon.” </p><p> They passed these up, grinned sheepishly, and</p><p>all ordered baked beans. </p><p> The next day I signed off, received an Iron</p><p>Dollar for eight months’ labor, and bade good-by </p><p>to the sea. </p><p> I wonder if any of the Camp-Fire readers were</p><p>aboard the Karluk with Captain McGregor during </p><p>the season of 1897? I would like to hear from </p><p>them.—Leverage. </p><p>IN SOME of Hugh Pendexter’s earlier </p><p>stories in our magazine we met the </p><p>Oneidas pretty frequently and now here </p><p>comes a comrade with their blood in his </p><p>veins to talk with us. When he wrote, </p><p>two days before the armistice was signed, </p><p>he was serving on the U. S. S. Roanoke, so </p><p>you see it has been a long time coming to </p><p>the surface in our mail-bag. Perhaps by </p><p>The Camp-Fire	181</p><p>this time he is at the headwaters of the </p><p>Amazon, according to his desire. But if </p><p>Walter R. Johnson remembers him and </p><p>will write him care of this office, Mr. Ben- </p><p>ton will probably get it sooner or later, for </p><p>he sits in at our Camp-Fire whenever he’s </p><p>where he can get to it. Or I can for- </p><p>ward to the name and address of friend </p><p>registered for Mr. Benton’s identification </p><p>card. </p><p> I	omit a small bit of his letter merely</p><p>because it endorses the idea of a badge for </p><p>us to wear and that badge has since then </p><p>been adopted and come into use. </p><p> Mr. Benton spells it “Oniedoes,” not</p><p>“Oneidas,” and, as his spelling is O.K. in </p><p>the remainder of his letter, I’m wondering </p><p>whether that is the French form or whether </p><p>I’m all wrong as to Oneidas being the </p><p>same tribe.

Perhaps </p><p>my looks justified his offer, for at the time my sole</p><p>possession was a dungarie suit and a suit of serge </p><p>in the clothing line.- But my most carefully </p><p>guarded secret was 27 English pounds at that date. </p><p>Four hours previous to our meeting I was beached </p><p>from the English tramp Union for getting too </p><p>affectionate with a pinch-bar. I was just barely </p><p>in my teens then, and I haven’t grown but one inch </p><p>and gained four or five pounds since, so perhaps </p><p>Mr. Johnson would still know me if we chanced </p><p>to meet again, which I hope will be in the near </p><p>future. </p><p> I may add that I have passed the expert rifle</p><p>course since that time, and I long for the war’s </p><p>end. I crave a trip far up the headwaters of the </p><p>Amazon and over the borders of Bolivia. After- </p><p>ward I still expect to return to the States and </p><p>become a settled “hombre.” But I would be glad </p><p>to hear from Mr. Johnson, and would appreciate </p><p>meeting him again very much. I would also like </p><p>to hear from Mr. Young. </p><p> So why not give it a trial? I have met many in</p><p>my years at sea. The most famous of the places </p><p>I Like to go to (when I call there) is Wilcox’s in </p><p>Colon. I still cast a longing eye and heart in the </p><p>direction of the San Bias country. </p><p> And I may say for the interest of all concerned</p><p>that I am a haLf&lt;east of the famous old tribe of- </p><p>the Oniedoes (as we were called by the French) </p><p>and now known as part of the “praying Indians” of </p><p>the North Country, and the other half Scot- </p><p>English.

S.—Please excuse my penmanship, as my</p><p>nerves are shattered. </p><p>182 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>ONE of you suggested the old Indian </p><p>sign as a kind of greeting or sign for </p><p>members of Camp-Fire when they meet or </p><p>when one of them wants to know whether </p><p>some other fellow is a member. (I sup- </p><p>pose there is still need to explain that any </p><p>one is a member who wishes to be.) I </p><p>wrote to “Uncle Frank” Huston to be sure </p><p>of just how the sign is made. He says: </p><p> Hand up, palm fonvard, thumb and fingers</p><p>joined. You’ve made the sign often and never </p><p>knew what it was. Of course, made casually and </p><p>quickly, the fingers are not always stuck and glued </p><p>together. Sometimes the hand is not raised above </p><p>the shoulder; again, level with ear; again, top of </p><p>head. </p><p> So there is the sign if any of you ever</p><p>care to use it. If you do, you’d better </p><p>say so, so that we can mention it at Camp- </p><p>Fire now and then to be sure that all mem- </p><p>bers, new and old, understand what it </p><p>signifies in our case. </p><p>CACTUS, barrel and giant. Some more </p><p>about it from one of our Southwestern </p><p>comrades: </p><p>Prescott, Ariz. </p><p> Just move .along a bit, will you, and make room</p><p>for me to sit next you at the Camp-Fire circle? </p><p>TN THE Camp-Fire of your Sept. 3rd issue </p><p>is a letter which 1 found interesting and also </p><p>somewhat a bit in error. The barrel cactus, which </p><p>is a source of water for the desert wanderer, is </p><p>quite accurately described by him; the thorns are </p><p>hooked slightly and are rather more elliptical in </p><p>cross section than flat, as he describes. These </p><p>thorns are about 3 in. in length. The cactus grows </p><p>from 3 to 4 ft. in height. The best way to procure </p><p>the water it contains is to cut off the top as one </p><p>cuts the top of a soft-boiled egg when set in an </p><p>egg-cup, dig out a bowl-shaped hollow, take a </p><p>long-bladed knife or a clean, sharp stick and jab </p><p>it up and down in the pulp, thus freeing the water </p><p>which will accumulate in the bowl prepared. </p><p>Quite a quantity of refreshing liquor will thus be </p><p>secured and it is a God-send to the man on the </p><p>desert whose water supply has been exhausted. </p><p> The otlier cactus he refers to is the giant cactus,</p><p>properly called saguaro (pronounced in this part </p><p>of the country and in Mexico “sah-hwar-ro” and </p><p>generally incorrectly spelled by the story writers). </p><p>I have seen this cactus attain p. height of 40 to 50 </p><p>ft. in many localities of the Southwest. I am </p><p>enclosing a photo of a comparatively small one </p><p>beside which I had my driver stand for a com- </p><p>parison. Being a bit nearer the camera than the </p><p>cactus, he is a little larger in perspective than his </p><p>true relative height would be. The other small </p><p>photo is of a group of young saguaros, which was </p><p>so unusual an occurrence for the number grouped </p><p>that I thought the photo worth taking. The large </p><p>photo is of a young saguaro and behind it is an </p><p>ocotillo (pronounced “o-ko-teel-yo”). </p><p>'VTOW a bit of criticism. If the comrade whose </p><p>letter I read walked from “Meyer” (Mayer) </p><p>to Phoenix, he probably took the Black Canon road, </p><p>which passes east of the Black Canon proper and </p><p>between it and the Agua Fria RlVer, crossing the </p><p>latter at Canon, where it takes a short turn to the </p><p>west just below the mouth of the Black Canon, </p><p>before continuing its southerly course. I hardly </p><p>think he would have walked through the Black </p><p>Canon unless prospecting for mineral. And cn </p><p>route to Phcenix from Mayer he does not get any- </p><p>where near Cave Creek, which is quite some miles </p><p>to the east of the Agua Fria, but he will cross Cave </p><p>Creek Wash after he has got down on to the desert </p><p>which is a continuation of the Salt River Valley, </p><p>to the west.—Chas. Edward Major. </p><p>LOOKING </p><p>AHEAD </p><p>FOR </p><p>DEMOCRACY </p><p>T^HIS Summer, at the National Classical Confer- </p><p>ence at the National Education Association’s </p><p>convention in Milwaukee, the dean of Princeton </p><p>University voiced the aim of the Conference—the </p><p>study of the classics must be maintained “because </p><p>they are vitally important to our own language." </p><p>“And,” said the dean, “to insist that there is no edu- </p><p>cation worth the name unless it involves training </p><p>Looking Ahead for Democracy </p><p>183 </p><p>the mind7 not for the sake of money, place or </p><p>power, but in order to develop our boys and girls </p><p>to their highest mental and moral excellence, to </p><p>make them masters in thought and in expression, </p><p>and thus to send them out equipped for lives of the </p><p>highest usefulness.” </p><p> ‘‘Highest mental and moral excellence,” token in</p><p>its broadest sense and given fullest application, is a </p><p>sufficiently high and comprehensive aim. But </p><p>when stated as justification for an organized move- </p><p>ment to maintain the study of Latin and Greek in </p><p>our schools and colleges it crumbles into dry scholas- </p><p>tic dust, proclaiming a vision of man’s place and </p><p>usefulness in the social order that is academic in </p><p>the worst sense of the word, narrow, hopelessly be- </p><p>hind the march of real civilization. </p><p>I ATIN and Greek. I had five years of one and </p><p>four of the other and to my own testimony I </p><p>I can add that of ninety-odd per cent, of all other </p><p>“classically educated” men and women whom I have </p><p>questioned that such expenditure of time and train- </p><p>ing on these subjects is misguided waste. Except </p><p>for the extremely small proportion of students who </p><p>fit themselves for the clergy, professorships or cer- </p><p>tain scientific lines. </p><p> Mind training? Why not get the same kind of</p><p>training by learning modern languages that will be </p><p>of infinitely more, and more practical, use? These </p><p>do not demand the same stiff mental labor? Wherein </p><p>is Greek stiffer than real study of academic Spanish? </p><p>And is Russian such child’s play? </p><p> And is it definitely established that the study of</p><p>any language os necessary to proper training of the </p><p>mind? </p><p> The excuse of “training” is a childish one.</p><p> Is it, then, that we should have some knowledge</p><p>and understanding of the customs, history and </p><p>genius of the two peoples who so greatly shaped </p><p>civilization? That is worth having—unless it </p><p>crowds from the boards more vital things. But </p><p>which gives more of it—time given to conjugations </p><p>and struggling translation, or a direct, intensive </p><p>study of the thing itself instead of its medium of </p><p>expression? </p><p>(~}ULTURE? What is culture? Our own con- </p><p>ception of it is as narrow and as selfish as the </p><p>Hun’s conception which he calls Kidtur. He </p><p>frankly tramples on the.rights and welfare of others;</p><p>ours is more dainty and anemic and merely turns </p><p>its back upon these things. </p><p> With us culture is a matter of learning, not of</p><p>wisdom or understanding or even of common sense. </p><p>To most Americans “culture” connotates litera- </p><p>ture, painting, sculpture, music, history, the niceties </p><p>of social attitude and behavior. I grew up in that </p><p>atmosphere and yet there always arises to me one </p><p>smashing question—what right has any one to </p><p>“culture” while a stone’s throw from him people are </p><p>being starved or maimed in body, mind or soul who </p><p>need not be thus starved and maimed if their </p><p>brothers and sisters would think less of this artificial </p><p>culture and vastly more of their obligations in mak- </p><p>ing human beings happier and more comfortable? </p><p>How do you answer that question? </p><p> Some day our whole selfish, cold conception of</p><p>culture will crumple up and vanish before the de- </p><p>mands of the facts of life. Just as our whole stupid, </p><p>selfish, inherited conception of education has al- </p><p>ready begun to crumple under the blows of life </p><p>itself. </p><p>1 ATIN and Greek. Yes, they have their values. </p><p> But with preventable human misery every-</p><p>where staring us in the face, with our politics filthy </p><p>in corruption, our economic fabric black with </p><p>selfishness and cruelty, and the very pillars of our </p><p>whole social structure shaking, then the culture and </p><p>training from Latin and Greek become small things </p><p>in the scheme of life. </p><p> Present culture and education have but one excuse</p><p>to offer and either too little or too much brains to </p><p>offer it, the excuse of Cain, the first murderer—“Am I </p><p>my brother’s keeper?” Some day they will realize </p><p>that they can have but one sound cxcuse, one pos- </p><p>sible purpose—making the Golden Rule more and </p><p>more a practical part of real living. </p><p> A fantastic dream? Not if you understand the</p><p>Golden Rule to be not a vague text from a book in </p><p>which you may not believe but the one and only </p><p>practical, work-a-day principle that can bring the </p><p>greatest good to the greatest number. </p><p>T ATTN and Greek! What good to teach a boy </p><p>Latin and Greek when you fail to teach him to </p><p>be a good citizen? Is the purpose of public schools </p><p>merely to teach each individual how best he can ad- </p><p>vance his own selfish interest? Or is it to teach each </p><p>one how each profits from all and all from each and </p><p>that the “public welfare” is not an empty phrase </p><p>but a direct and practical obligation lid upon</p><p>him? </p><p> And until we Americans learn that truth and begin</p><p>to practise it neither Labor nor Capital, Republicans </p><p>nor Democrats, Socialism, Bolshevism nor democ- </p><p>racy, nor any other class, party or theory can get </p><p>for us what every one of these claims it will get for </p><p>us. You can not build a sound house out of rotten </p><p>bricks, nor a sound government out of bad citizens. </p><p> There is no magic remedy. There can be no real</p><p>democracy except in the minds of the people. You </p><p>can put it there only by education.

We hope you will be patient if their answers are </p><p>at limes delayed: Capt.-Adj. Joseph Mills Hanson; Major A. M. Lochwitzky. </p><p>Ask Adventure </p><p>187 </p><p>Winter Hunting in Alaska </p><p>THERE is game a plenty for the man who </p><p>is used to roughing it; and game of the </p><p>sort one can seldom find in any other part of </p><p>North America. Then there is the joy of </p><p>the vast, silent places—the inimitable </p><p>wilderness: </p><p> Question:—“I should like to get some information</p><p>regarding the best place in Alaska, or northwest </p><p>Canada, to spend several months. I mean a place </p><p>where is plenty of big game, and far enough from </p><p>civilization that one will not be molested by others. </p><p>Would I have to employ a guide for such a trip? </p><p> What is the regulation regarding hunting in</p><p>Alaska, also in regard to .38 Colt Revolver and .351 </p><p>Automatic Winchester Rifle? Do you think that </p><p>one could find enough excitement to spend a whole </p><p>Winter up there; if so, could two men carry enough </p><p>equipment for the Winter? As we are accustomed </p><p>to traveling light we would expect rough conditions. </p><p>Could the trip be made in a canoe? </p><p> Any information concerning the route, place and</p><p>equipment (clothing rations, etc.,) will be thankfully </p><p>received. </p><p> What would you estimate the cost of the trip for</p><p>two fellows?”—W. E. Wentworth, U. S. Army. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Solomons:—You only have to</p><p>employ a guide on the Kenai Peninsula, south of the </p><p>new railroad that is being built. Elsewhere a guide </p><p>is unnecessary and a nuisance. The country is so </p><p>big and services of guides so little in demand that </p><p>there are no such things that are reliable. Any </p><p>weapons dependable in the States here are usable </p><p>and satisfactory in Alaska, except that for bull </p><p>moose and the Alaska grizzly—a not very frequently </p><p>met animal—you want a pretty fairly heavy bore </p><p>gun of high power. Otherwise, as to firearms in </p><p>general, I advise light ones to meet the difficulty of </p><p>getting over the ground, which is not inconsiderable </p><p>in the north, and which calls for as light equipment </p><p>as possible. </p><p> I couldn’t promise you “excitement” for a Winter</p><p>in Alaska, as it’s a rather quiet country and you do </p><p>quite a bit of traveling for what you see and get. </p><p>But if you’re looking for a change, and solitude and </p><p>wildness, and a fair amount of game, that’s the place. </p><p> You could ascend or descend a river to a suitable</p><p>place, in a canoe, taking enough essentials for a </p><p>Winter in the country. But I do not advise this </p><p>unless you’re bridle-wise to the undertaking. It </p><p>means Living mostly on the country. </p><p> You’d need little equipment. That part would be</p><p>all right. But the grub end of it might “give you </p><p>pause.” </p><p> An Alaskan Winter is a long time and you eat a</p><p>great deal, and your canoe, to be handily handled, </p><p>will not land you where you want to be with a great </p><p>deal of grub, after your other impedimenta is de- </p><p>ducted. But a steamer will land you anywhere on </p><p>either of the several big rivers, and with enough grub </p><p>to be comfortable. A very short distance from some </p><p>such point you could probably obtain the surround- </p><p>ings and habitat you seek and could get your outfit </p><p>there quite easily. </p><p> For a Summer’s trip a canoe trip would be very</p><p>nice, or one with a poling boat, and you might run </p><p>into some game—some small game, of course. But </p><p>as you do not specify your preferences, I could not </p><p>advise any definite part of Alaska as your objective. </p><p> As to the cost of the trip—there is not much to</p><p>pay after you leave the last transi&gt;ortation company </p><p>with your outfit. The cost of the latter you can </p><p>estimate for yourself. The cost of getting it into </p><p>the country will be about equal to the fare of one </p><p>man (outfit for two) to wherever you go. But if </p><p>you buy all your heavier stuff in Alaska, as you </p><p>should, it will probably come to somewhat less. </p><p>Thai’s all I can give you without specified inquiries </p><p>as to “routes, place, equipment, clothing, rations.” </p><p>Planting the South Sea Islands </p><p>HERE is some information which Mr. </p><p>Mills could not give you while the </p><p>war was on. Do you want a plantation </p><p>where the climate is glorious; where nearly </p><p>every conceivable kind of fruit and grain </p><p>can be raised; where one can choose, tem- </p><p>perate, semitropical, or torrid lands; where </p><p>the fishing is unsurpassed and the hunting </p><p>fine? There’s plenty of elbow-room still </p><p>in the world where one can make more than </p><p>a mighty good living: </p><p> Question:—“I am greatly interested in the South</p><p>Sea Islands as a money-making proposition; I </p><p>mean planting and also adventure. 1 am a motor </p><p>mechanic by trade, nineteen years old. My ques- </p><p>tions are: </p><p> 1.	What is the best and cheapest way to get</p><p>there? </p><p> 2.	What arc the licst islands to settle in?</p><p> 3.	What are the lxst things to plant for quick</p><p>results? </p><p> 4.	IIow much capital would be required?</p><p> 5.	What is the per cent, profit one could reason-</p><p>ably expect? </p><p> 6.	What is the white population of most South</p><p>Sea Islands? </p><p> 7.	Are motor tractors used at all, and how is the</p><p>planting done?”—Leonard J. Richards, Bendigo, </p><p>Australia. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Mills:—Now that the war is</p><p>over, you can get much information op the islands </p><p>that was forbidden during the course of the war. </p><p>By the way, if you will allow me the interpellation, </p><p>this is a good tip, too, for the other readers of </p><p>Adventure who have asked me for details which </p><p>were forbidden by the War Censor. It will interest </p><p>all and sundry to learn that when I started answer- </p><p>ing questions for “Ask Adventure” I recommended </p><p>my correspondents to write to the Union and other </p><p>shipping companies trading in the South Seas, </p><p>asking them to send copies of their very interesting </p><p>pamphlets on tours of the Islands. Some of my </p><p>replies were opened by the Censor, and then I </p><p>got an intimation from the Union S. S. Co. that </p><p>their pamphlets had been withdrawn from circu- </p><p>lation during the war period. I think that you </p><p>can apply to the Melbourne office of the Union </p><p>Steamship Company or the office of the Bums </p><p>Philp Company, Sydney or Brisbane, for a copy </p><p>of their pamphlets describing tours of the Islands </p><p>and on the conditions prevailing there. They </p><p>i88 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>are highly infqrmative publications. Now let me </p><p>get at your seven queries seriatim: </p><p> 1.	The best and cheapest way to the islands</p><p>from Bendigo will be either from Sydney or Bris- </p><p>bane, according to the group you decide upon. </p><p>That you should fix upon after perusing the sug- </p><p>gested pamphlets. Fares have altered so much </p><p>during the war period that I can not answer as to </p><p>cheapness. Here again the pamphlets will be of </p><p>value. Be sure lo tell the shipping company just </p><p>what you want. </p><p> 2.	Write to the Honorable the Minister of the</p><p>Interior, Melbourne, and ask him whether any </p><p>special inducements are on offer for settlers in </p><p>the.New Guinea (Papua) Group and other parts </p><p>of the South Seas that Australia now occupies. </p><p>Make sure of the climates, picking one that will </p><p>suit you. </p><p> 3.	Depends upon the group you choose. You</p><p>have a choice between oranges, bananas, copra </p><p>(coconuts)—and what about cotton? </p><p> 4.	Have your (&gt;ocket pretty well lined. Money</p><p>makes money even in lhe islands. Here again I </p><p>must be general, not definite. The money needed </p><p>depends upon the area you desire to take up. </p><p> 5.	As in other parts of the world, profits arc</p><p>according lo persistence. </p><p> 6.	Not many white folks on any of the groups.</p><p>Off the beaten track the whites are very few. </p><p>There is quite a settlement of whites on Raro- </p><p>tonga, in the Cook Group, and in Samoa. </p><p> 7.	The Islands have many of the conveniences</p><p>of modern lii'e, but I have not heard that they are </p><p>up to date with motor tractors. The plowing is </p><p>done in the good old-fashioned way. </p><p>Prospecting the Andes </p><p>IN THAT wild, little kuown country on </p><p>the eastern slope of the Andes, in Ecua- </p><p>dor, many believe bonanzas are to be found. </p><p>It’s a land where only the daring and the </p><p>strong can succeed—the 'kind of the savage </p><p>Jivaro. One man brought out a bag of </p><p>gold, but was insane. Other parties have </p><p>gone in, never to return. Still, fortunes </p><p>are being made there: </p><p> Question:—“[ am anxious to obtain some infor-</p><p>mation on the advisability ol a trip to the west </p><p>coast of South America, under the conditions men- </p><p>tioned. </p><p> There are two of us who will make this trip.</p><p>Our training and experience consists of many years </p><p>of roughing it in the Yukon territory and Alaska, </p><p>and a university training in geology at one of the </p><p>best universities. Have had a wide practical </p><p>knowledge of metal mining, including placer and </p><p>mining geology. </p><p> The primary object of this proposed trip would</p><p>be lo prospect for gold and silver, and due to a </p><p>lack of knowledge of the mineral resources of the </p><p>country, you might state the most advantageous </p><p>section, which would be free from malaria and </p><p>other diseases and still possess some good possi- </p><p>bilities. </p><p> What would be the cost of such a trip from San</p><p>Francisco, including fare and equipment? Please </p><p>mention the caliber and make of any firearms we </p><p>would need, considering the laws of the country </p><p>in question with regard to the importing of fire- </p><p>arms, the size, of the game and the ch.nee o£ secur- </p><p>ing ammunition. </p><p> Would you advise the purchase of burros upon</p><p>our arrival, to carry equipment and provisions? </p><p>What would be their cost? Would the hostility </p><p>of the natives hinder us in any way in the section </p><p>you would suggest?”—Victor E. Ekholm, Strawn, </p><p>Texas. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Young:—Possibly the richest</p><p>country in minerals of all South America is the </p><p>republic of Colombia, said to be the richest bound- </p><p>ary of land above water in the entire world. Since </p><p>1739, 12,728 gold mines have made good, and fcr </p><p>the past year the average in gold exported has </p><p>been over 300,000 dollars’ worth per month. The </p><p>amount of silver that has been exported staggers </p><p>the imagination. Colombia also furnished the </p><p>world with the bulk of its emeralds, mainly from </p><p>the famous Muzo district, from which emeralds </p><p>have been mined since immemorial times. </p><p> The platinum of Colombia is much purer than</p><p>the Russian metal and the supply "is increasing </p><p>yearly. Formerly this metal was thrown away </p><p>and was a source of much trouble to the miners </p><p>to get rid of it from the gold. Now they are dig- </p><p>ging up the streets where it was formerly thrown </p><p>and panning the dirt. Copper, tin, lead, zinc, </p><p>mercury, antimony, arsenic, sulphur, coal, asphalt,</p><p>petroleum, iron, rubies, sapphires, garnets, ame- </p><p>thysts are being extracted and exported. </p><p> However, for the prospector, due to the fact that</p><p>Colombia has been fairly well prospected over, I </p><p>would suggest Ecuador as a more likely spot to </p><p>make a rich strike. This is the same kind of </p><p>country and the minerals have scarcely been </p><p>touched. I was talking last week to a man who </p><p>made the trip from Rio Bamba by foot to the </p><p>Napo, and on down to Iquitos by boat, and he </p><p>told me he saw the Indians with lots of dust to </p><p>trade. </p><p> There is a tribe of very hostile Indians called</p><p>the Jiveros, or Jivaros, up above where he struck </p><p>the river, and it is impossible to get up into their </p><p>country, due to the fact that they will not allow </p><p>a white man nor neighboring Indians to enter. This </p><p>man’s name is Walter R. Johnson. </p><p> When I was in Ecuador a few years ago I met</p><p>up with a Mr. Morley at Huigra and he also told </p><p>me about rich gold country over there. There </p><p>was a party went in and the lone man who came </p><p>out, a negro, the ninth man of the party, who </p><p>came out at Para, brought a huge bag of very </p><p>large nuggets out with him. He was crazy as a </p><p>loon, but drew a map after he got back here in </p><p>the United States. Another party came down </p><p>with the map this negro had made and after they </p><p>went in nothing was ever heard ol them. Walter </p><p>Johnson told me they were above the little village </p><p>of Napo. which is Jivero, and bad country. He </p><p>says there &gt;s no danger below this village, but </p><p>plenty of it above. Also he claimed the Indians </p><p>were very'tame after you leave Napo going down- </p><p>stream. The way he put it, he said he would </p><p>guarantee that a man struck good placer ground </p><p>on this river. The Ecuadorian people are buffa- </p><p>loed by those Indians over there, and there is a </p><p>chance that there is a bonanza located there. You </p><p>can take that with salt if you want to; you know </p><p>Ask Adventure </p><p>how visionary we old prospectors get to be, and </p><p>Walt is as bad as I am. </p><p> That is the country I would pick if I went back</p><p>in South America to prospect, due to the following </p><p>reasons: Colombia has been pretty well located </p><p>up, Peru was worked Out fairly well by the Incas, </p><p>Bolivia is solid full of mineral, and has many com- </p><p>panies looking it over, Chili is mostly nitrates, and </p><p>water is scarce. </p><p> My next bet would be either Venezuela or the</p><p>Guianas, and then northern Brazil. </p><p> There is a railroad operated by an American</p><p>company running up into the interior of Ecuador </p><p>to Quito from Duran, just across the river from </p><p>Guayaquil. Guayaquil is a hell-hole for fever, </p><p>but after an hour’s ride you arc above the fever </p><p>line and it begins to get cool. You can go from </p><p>sea level to perpetual snow. </p><p> The climate after you get into the high plateau</p><p>about 10,000 feet high, is delightful. The good </p><p>prospecting country is on the eastern slope of the </p><p>country, to my notion, in the extreme headwaters </p><p>of the rivers flowing into the Amazon. Right at </p><p>Rio Bamba you cross a stream that could float a </p><p>canoe which flows into the Amazon. It could </p><p>float one, but it would be hard work, for it’s just </p><p>a few feet across at this point. I looked at it with </p><p>this view in mind and believe by wading part of </p><p>the way until a man reached more water he could </p><p>run a canoe right from Rio Bamba, if he took it </p><p>easy and did not get smashed up. </p><p> There is a road running back into the Archidona</p><p>district from Quito, and the trip can be made by </p><p>mule to Papallacta. There is a man in Papallacta </p><p>who sends mules to Quito to bring people out. </p><p>From there it’s pack work with Indian packers. </p><p>I think they charge five dollars (U. S.) for the </p><p>eighteen days pack (per Indian) from Papallacta </p><p>to Napo, packing about a hundred pounds. These </p><p>Indian packers are wonders. I just came across </p><p>a note in “Quito to Bogota,” by A. C. Veatch, </p><p>which mentions them sending a message one hun- </p><p>dred miles in a day by an Indian runner through </p><p>rough country. There are other records of runs </p><p>of 250 and 300 miles that are unbelievable by a </p><p>white man. They have been bred for the purpose </p><p>from ancient times. They work for little pay and </p><p>will stick until the cows come home. </p><p> The first class fare from San Francisco to Guaya-</p><p>quil is about $140. Second class is much less, </p><p>and with a hammock and a few dollars to the</p><p>steward, is not bad. I prefer a freight boat, and </p><p>if you could make connection with a captain who </p><p>would sign you on as super-cargo or purser, and </p><p>then accept about fifty dollars, it is much better. </p><p>I never saw a captain of a tramp yet who wouldn't </p><p>carry a man if approached right. </p><p> Firearms: .30-30 rifle or carbine; .38 or Colt</p><p>standard; .22 single shot, or repeating, for a ..able gun. </p><p> Game: Puma, jaguar, bear, tapir, armad llo,</p><p>anteater, opossum, capybara, deer (red and white), </p><p>hare, rabbit, monkey, birds of many kinds, fish </p><p>of many kinds (will not bite a hook, but are killed </p><p>with berries by the Indians). In the lowlands </p><p>on both eastern and western side there are many </p><p>reptiles, but these disappear in the highlands. </p><p>In the extreme highlands game is scarce. </p><p> Pack with Indians instead of burros. You can</p><p>get burros or llamas (sulky brutes) in the high </p><p>country. An Indian can travel ten times as fast </p><p>and is less trouble. </p><p>189 </p><p> I am giving you a line on a rainbow end that</p><p>I would tackle if I had prospecting in my head </p><p>just at present. </p><p> Write Pan-American Union, Washington, D. C.,</p><p>for the booklet, “Ecuador.” </p><p> There are a number of American outfits working</p><p>in Colombia up around Medellin and all of them </p><p>are good for a job if a man blows in. It’s no use </p><p>to write them from this end, though. If you </p><p>stopped in Colombia and looked these mines over </p><p>it might give you an idea of the formations to be </p><p>met with in Ecuador, but it's a hard trip to get </p><p>back up to them in Colombia, due to lack of trans- </p><p>portation. </p><p> You can get all provisions necessary in Quito,</p><p>Rio Bamba, or other cities and towns. Gold </p><p>pans, etc., should be taken from this end, for the </p><p>wooden bowls the Indians use are unwieldy for a </p><p>white man. I have used a large frying-pan in </p><p>place of a pan. </p><p>Orange Growing in California </p><p>THE great exodus from city to farm </p><p>seems to be under way. At least our </p><p>“Ask Adventure” experts are deluged with </p><p>letters asking how and where one can ^et </p><p>a living from the soil and make a real ho.uc. </p><p>If you are one of those who contemplate</p><p>such a move, don’t forget that oranges </p><p>yield often $400 per acre. Mr. Harriman </p><p>gives some sound advice about raising cit- </p><p>rus fruits: </p><p> Question:—In the near future my parents and I</p><p>intend moving to southern California. Therefore </p><p>I should like any information you can give regard- </p><p>ing this part of your State, especially the section </p><p>lying near Los Angeles. </p><p> Is orange raising profitable? What books can</p><p>I read on orange culture? Is orange land expensive? </p><p> How large are the ranches usually owned in</p><p>southern California? </p><p> I understand there are agents who undertake</p><p>the sale of one’s oranges, and who also buy them </p><p>on the trees. Is this true? </p><p> We would like to board in Los Angeles while</p><p>looking over the ground. Can one rent a five-acre </p><p>farm with the intention of buying later? And how </p><p>much clear profit might be expected from a good </p><p>crop on such a farm? </p><p> What is the fare from this city, and how long</p><p>would travelling time be?”—Francis J. Zoeller, </p><p>Brooklyn, N. Y. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Harriman:—Yes, orange culture</p><p>is very profitable to experts. I have no lists of </p><p>books with me here, for I am !KX) miles from home. </p><p>Yes, the land is expensive. About all available </p><p>land fit for citrus fruit lias been set to trees now. </p><p> An orange ranch in full bearing brings from</p><p>S2,000 to $15,500 an acre. Young trees on new </p><p>land, with five years still to wait before bearing, </p><p>bring from $1,200 to $1,500 an acre. Land with </p><p>one-year-old trees brings from $750 to $1,000 an </p><p>acre. </p><p> The orange orchards average around 15 to</p><p>25 acres each, though some are larger, even up to </p><p>100 acres. </p><p>Adventure </p><p>190 </p><p> The otange growers have associations that handle</p><p>the entire crop in any particular section, but the </p><p>growers do their own picking mostly. </p><p> The best thing you can do about a boarding</p><p>place is to go to some hotel like the “Trenton” on </p><p>Olive Street, and stop there while you hunt up the </p><p>kind of place you like. </p><p> No owner of a citrus orchard would consider</p><p>renting it to any man who was unused to citrus </p><p>culture, because an inexperienced man would ruin </p><p>it. As for the clear profit, that depends upon soil, </p><p>the man in charge, the use of fertilizer, etc., but </p><p>growers expect about $300 to $450 an acre profit. </p><p> See your Brooklyn railway agent about fare and</p><p>time of travel. No use in writing clear across the </p><p>continent to learn what is at your own door, nor </p><p>is there any use in my bothering a local agent to </p><p>hunt up information you should get there. </p><p> Be careful how you trust real estate agents.</p><p>Raising Ginseng </p><p>MANY herb experts are now success- </p><p>fully raising this valuable plant in </p><p>the United States. But Korea seems to be </p><p>the boss land for ginseng. As for cultivat- </p><p>ing it in the tropics, there are many con- </p><p>flicting opinions. Has any of you ever </p><p>seen the plant grown in a hot climate? </p><p> Question:—“I am desirous of experimenting on</p><p>my plantation with ‘Ginseng,’ and as I know </p><p>nothing whatever about this root I will be very </p><p>thankful for any information which you may be </p><p>able to send regarding same. </p><p> We have good soil and a splendid rainfall, and the</p><p>temperature varies from 83 to 90 degrees the year </p><p>round, so you see we have no Winter or extreme </p><p>heat.”—CnAS. E. Hamilton, Misima Island, Papua, </p><p>Australasia. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Ritchie:—As to trying the experi-</p><p>ment of raising ginseng in the Papuan group, I can </p><p>only give you the broadest first-hand information. </p><p>But I am writing the U. S. Department of Agri- </p><p>culture at Washington, D. C., to ask if they have </p><p>any bulletins on ginseng culture; if they send me </p><p>any material on the subject I shall forward it at </p><p>once to you. </p><p> As you know, doubtless, Korea leads in the pro-</p><p>duction of ginseng, though a small amount comes </p><p>from Manchuria, and in some of the Southern </p><p>States of this country ginseng is raised with more </p><p>or less success. The climate of Korea is temperate, </p><p>with snows in Winter and rarely higher tem[&gt;era- </p><p>ture than 90 degrees in Summer. The Korean </p><p>root is collected after the first frost, when the sap </p><p>of the plant has all gone to the root. It is pre- </p><p>pared after an elaborate native formula of macera- </p><p>tion in rice water and drying in a closed pot over </p><p>a slow fire. </p><p> Offhand, I should say that the great difference</p><p>in your climate over the Korean would prohibit </p><p>the success of its growing with you. It is dis- </p><p>distinctly not a tropical plant; whether it can be </p><p>grown successfully in a tropical climate I can not </p><p>dare say. I hope that the Agriculture Department </p><p>may have a bulletin which will give you much more </p><p>specific information than I can. </p><p>Ancient Ruins of Central America </p><p>f | 'HAT a highly civilized race, the Mayas, </p><p>existed in that region just south of </p><p>Mexico, is a proven fact. Their cities and </p><p>temples are fast being excavated. But even </p><p>yet many remain undiscovered in the depths </p><p>of dark Central American jungles. By rail- </p><p>road or boat one can be carried almost to </p><p>the doors of these ancient ruins. And the </p><p>great mysteries of this early race will no </p><p>doubt soon be solved: </p><p> Question:—“I have read with much interest your</p><p>notes on “Central America As It Is” in Adventure of </p><p>eighteenth April issue, but I would like some direct </p><p>information on British Honduras, Guatemala, etc., </p><p>in regard to the ruins of the Maya period. </p><p> What is the best way to reach them and are the</p><p>principal ruins far from the beaten path? From the </p><p>little practical knowledge I have on the subject, I </p><p>assume the United Fruit Co. steamers are best way </p><p>of reaching British Honduras and Guatemala. </p><p>But how near one can get to the best known ruins is </p><p>what I wish to know, and any information you can </p><p>give me on this subject will be gratefully received.” </p><p>—Wentworth G. Field. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Young:—Quirigua ruins, where</p><p>extensive excavations have been made, is within a </p><p>mile of the railroad that crosses Guatemala. Copan </p><p>which has been excavated, revealing a city of great </p><p>magnitude, is about sixty miles from the Guatemalan </p><p>Railway, which is about as good a way to get there </p><p>as any other. I think the road leaves from Zacapa</p><p>for this i&gt;oint. </p><p> Professor Marshall H. Saville, Department of</p><p>Anthropology, Columbia University, has taken </p><p>several scientific expeditions down to Central </p><p>America. Another American who spent the greater </p><p>part of several years making excavations in Copan is </p><p>Mr. George Byron Gordon. He wrote some articles </p><p>for Century on this subject, which were published </p><p>about 1904 or 1905. </p><p> Less extensive operations have been carried on in</p><p>the ruins of Tical, Quiche, Tehuacan, Ciudad An- </p><p>tigua, Sebaco, Matagalpa, Boaca Viejo, San Pedro </p><p>de Lovago, Leon Viejo, Granada,Nandaimo,Diriomo, </p><p>Pearl Lagoon, Omelepe Island and other islands of </p><p>the Gran Lago, and the Chiriqui ruins of Panama </p><p>and Costa Rica. </p><p> The ruins in Nicaragua arc fairly easy of access,</p><p>but the work done there has been slight. The </p><p>interior of Honduras has only been scratched in this </p><p>respect. I have not heard of any discoveries being </p><p>made in British Honduras, the principal ones that </p><p>have come to my notice being in Spanish Honduras. </p><p>However, I have no doubt ruins of this kind exist in </p><p>British Honduras, also. </p><p> The best way to reach Guatemala is via United</p><p>Fruit boat to Puerto Barrios, and up by rail to the </p><p>interior. Spanish Honduras is reached by mule </p><p>from the end of a small railroad running inland from </p><p>Puerto Cortez. It is about an eight-day trip to the </p><p>capital. There is an auto bus running up to Teguci- </p><p>galpa from Amapala, on the Pacific side. I believe </p><p>better time can be made by crossing Guatemala by </p><p>rail and then making the trip up from Amapala </p><p>than by taking the mule trip from the Atlantic </p><p>side. </p><p>LOST TRAILS </p><p> Note—We offer this department of the "Camp-Fire" free of charge to those</p><p>of our readers who wish to get in touch again with old friends or acquaintances </p><p>from whom the years have separated them.
