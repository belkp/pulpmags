In the act of unceremon- </p><p>iously breaking in on the scene below, his </p><p>captain’s uplifted finger held him, and he </p><p>waited thus, staring across the smoke- </p><p>blurred forecastle triangle, waiting for the </p><p>forefinger of the brown sea-fist to fall. </p><p> It was a huge fist he' watched, and the</p><p>frame behind, lolling on a bunk, fully </p><p>matched the fist.

I thaought you aought to lcnaow!” </p><p> “Confound it all, Hughie—you’re right</p><p>I ought to know!” cried his Viking captain. </p><p> He sprang from his bunk as he spoke and</p><p>rushed for the ladder, yelling for his men to </p><p>follow. </p><p> “Tumble up, boys!” he exhorted. “Out</p><p>of the way, Hughie—I’ll go first! Oh, yes— </p><p>Lance, come on if you want to!” </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>THE FREIGHTER AUK </p><p>TAYLOR was up the ladder and on deck </p><p>with amazing agility for one of such </p><p>great frame, and on his heels tumbled </p><p>Hughie and all the crew with the Reverend </p><p>Lance hastily ascending in the rear. </p><p> From the deck of the Graywing the</p><p>captain looked out across the heaving </p><p>Strait of Belle Isle, across the green-blue </p><p>waters streaked with frozen froth, jeweled </p><p>with pale-emerald floating ice and overlaid </p><p>with the mother-of-pearl of a rising moon. </p><p>Southeastward, between him and Belle Isle </p><p>Island, wrapped ghost-like in Atlantic fog, </p><p>yawed the freighter Hughie Hay had</p><p>sighted, not an ocean-going cargo steamer </p><p>but a sixty-ton schooner carrying Labrador </p><p>stationers to their Summer fishing-stations. </p><p> Too poor to own their own schooners,</p><p>the stationers were freighted down the </p><p>coast to their rooms every Spring and </p><p>herded up again like cattle in the Autumn </p><p>on vessels belonging to the firm with which </p><p>they dealt. </p><p> “Yonder she is!” the captain pointed out</p><p>to Reverend Lance. “And a fine little </p><p>plague-ship for your ministering, Lance!” </p><p>The Foaming Fore Shore </p><p>5 </p><p> “What ship is it?” demanded Lance,</p><p>peering short-sighted over the shimmering </p><p>sea. </p><p> “The Auk, over from Bay of Islands on</p><p>Newfoundland,” Taylor told him. “Be- </p><p>longs to old Peter Laval and doing business </p><p>from Chateau to Chidley.” </p><p> “H’m. H’m. Laval, eh? One of my best</p><p>church supporters,” commented Lance. </p><p> “Sanctimonious old whelp,” corrected</p><p>Taylor. “Good heavens, his old wagon </p><p>will ruin my eight-hundred-dollar cod trap! </p><p>Where’s the French fishery cruiser? </p><p>Where’s Admiral Pellier and his Groix?” </p><p> “Yaonder off’n York Point, Cap’n!”</p><p>spoke Hughie Hay. </p><p> He pointed where, almost invisible be-</p><p>hind a jumble of low icebergs deep azure </p><p>in the shadows, the long black hulk of the </p><p>Fishery Protection Service cruiser lay at </p><p>anchor together with the admiral’s private </p><p>yacht Esperance, which he used as an </p><p>auxiliary vessel for shore work ’round the </p><p>harbors. </p><p> “Then why isn’t he on his job?” de-</p><p>manded Taylor who had run foul of Pellier </p><p>several times on his Newfoundland voyages </p><p>and who had at last been definitely warned </p><p>off the French Shore. “If I happen to </p><p>dry a seine taut in the sun he’s after me </p><p>for the size of my mesh, but Laval’s blunder- </p><p>ing Auk here can—by the tall Pole Star, </p><p>look, there’s no one at her wheel! We’ve </p><p>got to board her!” </p><p> Swiftly he sprang to take his own wheel,</p><p>beckoning the regular wheelsman, Brown, </p><p>to his side, and at the same time calling </p><p>orders to his men who, swift as he, ran up </p><p>the big mainsail and backed over the jib. </p><p> “No time for dories, boys,” he warned.</p><p>“Have to jump her rail as we go by. Brown, </p><p>grab this wheel when I say! And you, </p><p>Bolero, fall to and handle the sheets for </p><p>Brown when he comes about on the other </p><p>tack!” </p><p> Under Taylor’s guidance the Graywing</p><p>caught her stride, headsails ballooning, </p><p>fore and main booms crashing across as </p><p>she leaped toward the yawing Auk not three </p><p>cable-lengths away. The freighter swung </p><p>drunkenly to starboard. Taylor veered </p><p>a point or two in his course, and as swiftly, </p><p>as silently and as smoothly as a knife skirts </p><p>a pot of grease he skirted her rail and </p><p>barked to Brown at his elbow. </p><p> Brown’s hands fell upon the spokes</p><p>Taylor’s hands left, and Taylor with a </p><p>running jump vaulted the rails of the </p><p>Graywing and Auk as a double hurdle. </p><p>Hughie Hay, Irish Kerrigan, Boston Jim, </p><p>Patterson, Scotty McCaig and Tom Halifax </p><p>were over the hurdle with him. With him </p><p>they landed upon the cluttered deck of </p><p>the Auk, and as they heaved themselves </p><p>up out of the amazing muddle of things </p><p>that burdened the freighter they found to </p><p>their surprise the Reverend Lance in their </p><p>midst. </p><p> “You here too, Lance?” grinned Taylor.</p><p>“Haven’t lost your college legs yet, eh? </p><p>Well, maybe you’ll need your college fists </p><p>Ss well. Looks like a free-for-all fight and </p><p>lots of unsavory facts—but steady, boys </p><p>o’ mine, steady, we have to handle the </p><p>schooner, you see, before we handle her </p><p>crew. Lower the heavy canvas—yes, both </p><p>of them, fore and main.” </p><p> He himself grasped the freighter’s kicking</p><p>wheel and quickly brought her to under </p><p>jumbo alone. </p><p> Then with a rush he and his men jumped</p><p>away from the canvas-billowcd booms and </p><p>dived down among the struggling mass that </p><p>glutted the Auk below decks. </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>THE FLOWER OF THE COAST </p><p>“ A FINE little floating plague-ship, eh, </p><p>Lance?” was Taylor’s war-cry as he </p><p>went smiting right and left into the packed </p><p>rabble that would have made a full passen- </p><p>ger list for a five-hundred-ton coasting </p><p>steamer. </p><p> Being of only sixty tons, the Auk had</p><p>no space below to boast of, and what space </p><p>she had was crammed to the last inch, so</p><p>that Taylor and his crew could get no </p><p>footing at first but rode upon the hips and </p><p>backs and shoulders of men in their effort </p><p>to smash an opening in the jam. </p><p> According to the custom of freighters,</p><p>the Auk’s hold was first spread with a layer </p><p>of unbreakable cargo. A second layer of </p><p>traps, nets and seines overspread this. </p><p>While upon the bed of twine rested the </p><p>bunks of the stationers with their gear </p><p>in bags, boxes and barrels sheering in </p><p>pyramids to the deck overhead. </p><p> Here they herded, eating and sleeping</p><p>in cramped unsanitary quarters, carrying </p><p>on a travesty of cooking by turns at the </p><p>tiny galley or bolting their food raw. </p><p>6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Nothing but make-shift sailcloth partitions </p><p>screened the women’s bunks from the men’s. </p><p>In the melee these partitions had been tom </p><p>away and shrieking women and girls in </p><p>various stages of dishabille were mael- </p><p>stromed in the swaying horde that trampled </p><p>their bunks under foot and sent the tiers </p><p>of boxes and barrels toppling on their </p><p>heads. </p><p> Under the showering ruin they huddled</p><p>in the dancing light of the smoky lanterns, </p><p>raising hopeful eyes at the coming of the </p><p>Graymng’s crew, and one young girl, </p><p>crouching for shelter at the foot of the mast, </p><p>flung out her arms in appeal to Taylor in </p><p>the lead. </p><p> “Ah, mon Americain—mon Americain!”</p><p>she cried. </p><p> White as a lily she gleamed in the un-</p><p>washed horde, her delicate, beautifully- </p><p>chiseled, oval face terror-bleached till it </p><p>seemed carved from ivory. Over the </p><p>tapered curves of her half-bare shoulders </p><p>where her enfolding cloak lay low on her </p><p>neck, over her forehead patricianly high, </p><p>her hair was tossed in a tangle like silken </p><p>floss, and through the golden net her great </p><p>eyes flashed out, eyes violet-blue as the </p><p>tint of Labrador ice in shadow, as the </p><p>water-heart of a lonely cliff-walled Lab- </p><p>rador fiord—such eyes as a man may see </p><p>but once in a thousand miles of Labrador </p><p>coast. </p><p> “Ah, mon Americain—vitel” she appealed</p><p>in a voice like the silver lapping of the </p><p>Summer waves. “Mon Americain—vitel” </p><p> “Great heavens!” exclaimed Taylor in-</p><p>voluntarily as he struggled toward her. </p><p>“Who in the name of the mermaids is she?” </p><p> “Marie Laval—the flower of the coast,</p><p>they call her!” spoke the voice of Lance at </p><p>his shoulder. “You know old Peter. He’s </p><p>her father.” </p><p> “But—but how is it I’ve never seen her</p><p>before?” panted Taylor, knocking men this </p><p>way and that in his effort to reach her. </p><p> “She’s been schooling at St. John’s. I</p><p>guess she’s through this Summer. I re- </p><p>member now old Peter told me he was going </p><p>to take her on the stations. Yonder’s old </p><p>Peter behind her—and her mother, old </p><p>Anne. Both too fond of their smuggled </p><p>brandy, Taylor, if I do say it with a clerical </p><p>tongue. Can’t you smell it in the air? A </p><p>perfect reek, and I shouldn’t be at all sur- </p><p>prised at this .bedlam! I know Peter’s </p><p>brandy has been the cause.” </p><p> “And that’s their daughter!” marveled</p><p>Taylor. “The flower of the coast! Yes— </p><p>a flower in the slime! Quick, boys o’ mine, </p><p>get the women up on deck!” </p><p> Drunkenly clinging to the mast behind</p><p>Marie, he had full glimpse of her parents </p><p>in his rush, old Anne, brown-faced, brown- </p><p>eyed as a gipsy, fat, ungainly, in slovenly </p><p>galoshes, tubbed-up skirt and greasy head- </p><p>shawl covering her oiled black hair from </p><p>which gold ear-rings peeped; old Peter in </p><p>worn hip boots and oilskins, his yellow </p><p>toothless face lighted by cold, colorless, </p><p>icicle-like eyes and, by strange anomaly, </p><p>shaven bare except for a narrow snow- </p><p>white fringe of whisker that rimmed it from </p><p>ear to ear under his drooping southwester. </p><p> He glimpsed them, unconsciously noting</p><p>every characteristic, every detail, but his </p><p>thought was only of Marie, and, jamming </p><p>swaying bodies apart with his shoulders </p><p>and knees, he forced an opening and gath- </p><p>ered her pliant body into his arms. </p><p> “Merci, mon Americain—merci, mon Vik-</p><p>ing!” she half-laughed, half-sobbed in im- </p><p>petuous gratitude. “I had the fear of </p><p>death under those stamping heels but, </p><p>voild, I knew you would come when I </p><p>called!” </p><p> “Ha, my flower of the coast!” breathed</p><p>Taylor as he fought his way on deck with </p><p>her. “Could I leave such a flower as you </p><p>in the slime?” </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>ADMIRAL PELLIER AND THE ESP ERA NCR </p><p>T&gt; EHIND Taylor, breaking into the cool </p><p>night air upon the chaotic deck, came </p><p>Lance, guiding the stumbling Peter and </p><p>Anne up the ladder by the arms, while after </p><p>Lance, with tugging and shouting, Hughie</p><p>Hay, Irish Kerrigan, Boston Jim, Patterson, </p><p>Scotty McCaig and Tom Halifax heaved </p><p>the women to safety. </p><p> As Taylor straightened himself up on the</p><p>Auk’s deck he saw through the black snarl </p><p>of her mainsheets the wings of another </p><p>schooner all silver in the moonlight. </p><p> “Brown,” he yelled, taking it at first</p><p>for the Graywing. “Brown—but hold on, </p><p>it’s not my schooner! It’s the Espcrance.” </p><p> “Oui, the Esperance, and quite at your</p><p>service, Capilaine Taylor,” spoke an even </p><p>voice from the stern of the Auk. </p><p> Taylor wheeled and stared through the</p><p>The Foaming Fore Shore </p><p>7 </p><p>amazing litter of boats, oars, buoys and </p><p>fishers’ paraphernalia that covered the </p><p>vessel from bow- to stern. A boat full of </p><p>men was moored to the rail, and three </p><p>boarding figures cast long inky shadows </p><p>across the afterdeck. </p><p> Instantly Taylor recognized the figures</p><p>that cast the shadows: Pellier of the Groix, </p><p>his well-knit body and military shoulders </p><p>filling his commanding admiral's uniform, </p><p>his close-clipped brown beard touched silver </p><p>by the moon and his keen brown eyes,' far- </p><p>focused from their constant sea-ranging, </p><p>burning out under the peak of his cap; </p><p>Jacques Beauport, boyish midshipman of </p><p>the Groix, likewise in uniform, dark-eyed, </p><p>swarthy-skinned, with the stealthy reserve </p><p>of a heart unfathomable stamped on his </p><p>Breton face; and “Codroy John,” Pellier’s </p><p>skipper of the Esperance, a gigantic bearded </p><p>Newfoundlander dressed in moleskin trou- </p><p>sers and canvas jacket, with a rugged, </p><p>craggy face and deep blue eyes prophetic </p><p>as the eyes of a seer. </p><p> “At your service, Capitaine Taylor!”</p><p>repeated Pellier. “And what is the trouble </p><p>this time, I would like to know?” </p><p> “None of my making but yours for the</p><p>’tending,” answered Taylor gruffly. </p><p>“Though I’ve done half the job for you. </p><p>There was a drunken fight below and we </p><p>got the Lavals and all the women out for </p><p>fear of their being trampled.” </p><p> “Dieu—the Lavals!” exclaimed Pellier,</p><p>leaning forward and staring at old Peter </p><p>and Anne in the moonlight. </p><p> His eyes switched to the face of the girl</p><p>Taylor held, and the Gloucester captain </p><p>saw him start and draw up his shoulders </p><p>more rigidly. </p><p> “Then in that case,” Pellier went on</p><p>rapidly in a voice official in its intonation, </p><p>“I shall put them ashore in my boat while </p><p>my men restore order in the Auk’s hold. </p><p>Jacques! Codroy John! Tell them I am </p><p>aboard and let that still their tongues or </p><p>they will be taken in charge.” </p><p> Jacques Beauport and Codroy Jbhn dived</p><p>below, and Taylor could hear them yelling </p><p>above the din, Beauport’s shrill staccato </p><p>cries spacing Codroy John’s booming roar. </p><p> “Stinking cod-hunters! Valid, will you-</p><p>revel in the cells at St. John’s? Listen, </p><p>makers of a thousand smells—the admiral </p><p>himself is on your cluttered deck. Oui, </p><p>Admiral Pellier of the Groixl” </p><p> “Aye,” in Codroy’s bass, “I’d like to die</p><p>if he bain’t! A stench ye be in the nose </p><p>o’ the Lard, ye fools! A powerful lot o’ </p><p>breakers o’ Newfoundland navigation laws, </p><p>runnin’ a vessel wild like this! Back to yer </p><p>bunks or ye’ll lose yer voyage and face the </p><p>Admiralty Court at St. John’s!” </p><p> Under the threat and the warning of</p><p>Pellier’s nearness the tumult died down </p><p>below decks, and Pellier himself waved old </p><p>Peter and Anne, meek as whipped curs, </p><p>into the Esperance's waiting boat. </p><p> “You, too, Marie—quickly!” he begged,</p><p>anxious to retrieve as far as possible an </p><p>awkward situation. </p><p> Marie hesitated, her violet-blue eyes</p><p>meeting Taylor’s for a moment in the moon- </p><p>glow before she slipped out of his protecting </p><p>grip. </p><p> “Au revoir, vion Viking, I will thank you</p><p>better when I can,” she whispered as she </p><p>glided after her father and mother. </p><p> With an odd feeling that somehow he</p><p>had been robbed of the fruits of liis efforts </p><p>below, Taylor watched the black boat </p><p>streaking off to the Esperance. </p><p> “Marie, Pellier called her,” he exclaimed,</p><p>turning slowly to Lance. “So the admiral </p><p>knows her as well as the parents—knows </p><p>her that well?” </p><p> Lance nodded confidentially.</p><p> “Knows her well,” he coincided, “and he</p><p>would marry her in a moment if she would </p><p>speak the word. But, there, hers is the </p><p>heart of a maid with a score of suitors, </p><p>among whom Jacques Beauport and his </p><p>commander are chief. The heart of a maid, </p><p>Taylor, and an impulsive heart at that. </p><p>You know how they are. She won’t pledge</p><p>herself to the admiral, much less to Beau- </p><p>port, though old Peter and Anne urge and </p><p>threaten and scheme. Do you think her </p><p>beautiful, Captain?” </p><p> “The most beautiful girl on the fore</p><p>shore!” admitted Taylor without hesitation. </p><p>“But is she—is she—well, Lance, I can’t </p><p>bring myself to say it of a girl like her, but </p><p>you know what some of the women on </p><p>these cursed freighters are, don’t you?” </p><p>Again Lance nodded, seriously, regret- </p><p>fully, his face all thoughtful lines in the </p><p>moonlight. </p><p> “That I do,” he confessed, “and my</p><p>protest based on this specific case goes </p><p>to the Government tonight. But not </p><p>Marie! I can take an oath under heaven </p><p>on that. Marie is pure as the heart of an </p><p>iceberg is pure. A victim of nothing but </p><p>8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>circumstances, Taylor—that and unsavory </p><p>parents. Hello—there’s another schooner </p><p>abeam of the Esperance. Is it your Gray- </p><p>•uring coming about? My eyes fail me in </p><p>the dazzle of the moon, </p><p>i Taylor looked up and gave an affirmative </p><p>shake of his head. </p><p> “The Graywing, boys o’ mine,” he</p><p>announced to his clustering crew. “Bor- </p><p>row some of the Auk's dories for a minute </p><p>and we’ll row back to the schooner.” </p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>HAULING THE TRAP </p><p>IN THE blaze of the rainbow dawn across </p><p>the glittering facades of the scores of </p><p>scattered icebergs the Graywing hove to </p><p>by Taylor’s trap berth in the strait, and </p><p>seven of the eight dories dropped overside. </p><p> Ever quick to progress, it was the Ameri-</p><p>cans themselves that had introduced seines </p><p>into the haunts of the cod. In place of </p><p>the ancient method of taking the fish by </p><p>hook and line or jigger, Captain Norman </p><p>of Brigus had brought the cod-trap down </p><p>on the Labrador. No longer men with the </p><p>ready money to purchase a trap bothered </p><p>with the hook and line or jigger or puttered </p><p>with the trawl. </p><p> With the great seines rich harvests were</p><p>drawn from the icy deep, and Taylor </p><p>himself on more than one occasion had </p><p>gathered an even hundred quintals at one </p><p>haul. Of the customary two hauls a day, </p><p>this was the lucky morning haul, and with </p><p>song and shout the Graywing's crews in </p><p>the dories raced expectantly for the moor- </p><p>ings of their berth. </p><p> Dead ahead of them, shining blood-red</p><p>upon the sapphire sea, bobbed the four </p><p>anchored buoys that buoyed the corners </p><p>of the vast square-topped bag of meshed </p><p>twine. The bag itself, invisible in the </p><p>watery depths of the strait, was open at </p><p>the top, its edges, full fifty feet to the side, </p><p>supported by long lines of cork floats </p><p>streaking from buoy to buoy. </p><p> From one corner branched a leader, a</p><p>single wall of net that walled the Belle Isle </p><p>currents across and inveigled up or down- </p><p>swimming fish into a funnel-like opening </p><p>in the trap. Once in, they never found </p><p>the small end of the funnel again, but swam </p><p>imprisoned ’round and ’round their huge </p><p>elastic cell. </p><p> Underrunning the agitated edges of the</p><p>trap, the seven dories sculled in place and, </p><p>laying aside their oars, the seven rowers </p><p>seized the floating edges of the pound. </p><p>Standing up to their work, swaying to the </p><p>heave of the swell through the strait, </p><p>timing their pull to a fisherman’s chanty, </p><p>they hauled their trap, lusty giants reaping </p><p>their finny harvest as fishers of all ages, </p><p>ever since the day of Peter, have cast forth </p><p>their nets and harvested the sea. </p><p> Heaving thus in the sudden glare of</p><p>golden sunlight, etched starkly against </p><p>the round blue hills of the Atlantic beyond, </p><p>every man stood out, his individuality fixed, </p><p>like a row of cleanly-sculptured bronze </p><p>statues poised against the azure sky: the </p><p>Viking Taylor, the adolescent Hughie Hay, </p><p>the expectorating Irish Kerrigan, the par- </p><p>son-like Boston Jim, the lopped-off Titan </p><p>Patterson, the braw McCaig, the battered </p><p>sealer, Halifax! </p><p> To the drone of their chanty they pursed</p><p>and pursed the trap, rising and falling, </p><p>heaving and holding, quivering there in a </p><p>web of striking color, color of indigo ocean, </p><p>crimson buoy, green-painted dory, sun- </p><p>gilded oilskins, diamond-dewed net—a </p><p>blood-pulsing picture all vivid as a startling </p><p>seascape hung upon dun walls. </p><p> Lustily they heaved and lustily they sang.</p><p> And in the center of the picture, rimmed</p><p>’round by the dripping, scintillating net </p><p>that sagged with the weight of its catch, </p><p>boiled a maelstrom of quicksilver, the </p><p>packed cod, mobile twenty-pounders lash- </p><p>ing furiously as they were pocketed tightly </p><p>in a solid mass. </p><p> “By the ribs o’ sunken Spanish galleons!”</p><p>cried Irish Kerrigan at the sight, “Ye’ve </p><p>topped wan hundred quintal this toime, </p><p>Capten!” </p><p> “That she is, men—an’ a quarter,”</p><p>calculated the lopped-off Titan Patterson.</p><p>“Ain’t it a record for the coast?” </p><p> “I believe you, Patty,” beamed Boston</p><p>Jim. “I reckon one hundred and ten was </p><p>all—” </p><p> But the rest of their calculations was lost</p><p>in Taylor’s roar. </p><p> “Alongside, Brown!” he bellowed, freeing</p><p>one bronzed hand and waving it to the </p><p>wheelsman of the Graywing who, with the </p><p>exception of the Cuban cook, Bolero, was </p><p>the only man left aboard. “Walk her up </p><p>in a hurry!” </p><p> “Right-o, Cap’n!” twanged Brown in</p><p>The Foaming Fore Shore </p><p>9 </p><p>acknowledgment. “Araound an’ araound </p><p>she goes!” </p><p> Holding hard, they could see Bolero dive</p><p>like a dark snake for the jib to back it over, </p><p>could mark Brown give and take his spokes </p><p>with sureness and serenity, and almost </p><p>before Taylor’s waving hand returned to </p><p>its grip on the net the silver-gray schooner, </p><p>graceful as a gull, breasted lightly down on </p><p>the dories. </p><p>CHAPTER VI </p><p>CHATEAU, THE STORIED </p><p>HAT livers to fry!” gasped Bolero </p><p>at sight of the prize haul. </p><p> He took the brown cigar from his teeth</p><p>and wiggled it exultingly. Then he and </p><p>Brown jumped snappily to the rail to handle </p><p>the dory tackles. </p><p> “Sluice them on deck—quick!” urged</p><p>Taylor. “Sag enough here to unjoint a </p><p>man’s arms!” </p><p> Bolero and Brown hooked on and swiftly</p><p>swung outboard the dip-net rigged on a </p><p>pulley. Up and down the splattering dip- </p><p>net plunged. In a silver stream the cod </p><p>were scooped inboard, all alive and flopping </p><p>in the pen, and while the dories, leaving </p><p>Taylor aboard, sheered off again to reset </p><p>the empty trap, Brown and Bolero hastened </p><p>to spread the splitting-tables amidships. </p><p> “Never mind, boys,” Taylor stopped</p><p>them. “I’m not salting these down. I’m </p><p>taking them in to Chateau to be made </p><p>ashore.” </p><p> Without a wink of surprise Bolero and</p><p>Brown desisted, Bolero going off imme- </p><p>diately to his tiny galley and Brown taking </p><p>his accustomed place at the wheel. They </p><p>made no comment then, but when the </p><p>dories were nested aboard once more and </p><p>sail crowded on the Graywing the crew had </p><p>opportunity to pass the word as the schooner </p><p>headed inshore. </p><p> “Aye, an’ ’tis made fish ashore, they’ll</p><p>be, ye ken,” winked Scotty McCaig to</p><p>Halifax. “An’ for why? Are the cod </p><p>nae plentiful an’ this the first week o’ June? </p><p>October’s a lang way aheid, Tammy. </p><p>Loys o’ time tae dry a few hundred quintals </p><p>ashore an’ still fill our hold tae ballast us </p><p>hame tae Gloucester! Eh, mon—wha’ </p><p>are ye gulletin’ doon yer laughs for?” </p><p>“Why’re you puttin’ that squint in them </p><p>canny eyes of yours, Scotty?” countered </p><p>Halifax. “Did you hear me gossip a word </p><p>about dryin’ ashore? So a Chateau firm </p><p>makes them cod—what? Well, Scotty, </p><p>I’ll jist venture a whisper in your cauli- </p><p>fiowered ear. I’ll bet you a pound o’ </p><p>Fisherman’s Friend I kin name the room </p><p>they’ll go to.” </p><p> “I take ye! Wha’ room, ye seventh son</p><p>o’ a prophet?” challenged McCaig. </p><p> “Old Peter Laval’s room!” prophesied</p><p>the battered sealer. </p><p> Wing and wing, the speed of a water-</p><p>witch in her rakish beautiful lines, Taylor </p><p>himself in Brown’s place at the wheel, the </p><p>Grayvnng drove on for Chateau Bay, the </p><p>grandest fiord on Labrador’s southern </p><p>fore shore. Past York Point, its western </p><p>entrance, she tacked, raising the sheer </p><p>basaltic cliff of the Devil’s Dining Table </p><p>capping Henley Island and fluttered on </p><p>through the cove-like harbor of Chateau </p><p>itself. </p><p> Rimmed ’round by towering Laurentian</p><p>hills covered with birch, balsam and spruce, </p><p>snuggling at the foot of Beacon Hill the </p><p>hoary thousand-foot sentinel of all, spread </p><p>the ancient, storied settlement. Here, Tay- </p><p>lor knew, Jacques Cartier in 1534 had first </p><p>set down his wandering foot on the shores </p><p>of his La Nouvelle France. </p><p> Here was the founding of his first settle-</p><p>ment of French colons that grew by the </p><p>hundreds, to be swelled in the middle of </p><p>the seventeenth century by bold Breton </p><p>emigrants, to be further augmented a full </p><p>century later by exiled Acadians who in </p><p>1843 located at Matashquan and inevitably </p><p>drifted in to Chateau till it hived in its </p><p>present glory of swarming population and </p><p>hummed with the ceaseless industry of the </p><p>fishing. </p><p> The industry of the fishers was the blood</p><p>and fiber of the place. Newfoundland mer- </p><p>chants marketed the catch, and of the </p><p>several firms doing business there Peter </p><p>Laval secured the bulk of the trade. Of </p><p>all the old-time dealers, slave-masters of </p><p>the outports and rogues and hypocrites at </p><p>heart, Taylor acknowledged old Peter the </p><p>peer. </p><p> No more skilful hand than old Peter’s</p><p>to cull a fisherman’s voyage and grade it </p><p>for his profit as damp or Madeira! </p><p> No swifter pencil than old Peter’s to</p><p>charge the planters double prices for sup- </p><p>plies and carry on his books without interest </p><p>their balancc at the settling upl </p><p>IO </p><p>Adventure </p><p> No, nor no greater pride than Peter’s</p><p>when sober, nor no deeper devotion as, a </p><p>pillar of the church, he sat in the front pew </p><p>and prayed for his delinquent livyeres in </p><p>the seats behind him. </p><p> And, lastly, no more sordid coiner of</p><p>men’s and women’s lives into Terranovan </p><p>dollars as evidenced in his custon of working </p><p>women as cheaper labor than men upon his </p><p>Labrador stations. </p><p>CHAPTER VII </p><p>old peter’s room </p><p>LAVAL’S establishment lay in the curve </p><p>J of the cove below the village graveyard </p><p>sleeping under the slant of Beacon Hill. </p><p>It consisted of a long wooden jetty, a barn- </p><p>like supply store generally known as the </p><p>barter-house, miserable, tumble-down fish- </p><p>sheds and a disgraceful room, sod-thatched </p><p>and rough-boarded on unbarked studs. </p><p> Up and down the jetty stalked old Peter,</p><p>his keen, colorless, icicle-like eyes over- </p><p>seeing everything that went on and at the </p><p>same time watching the crowded shipping </p><p>of the harbor. </p><p> “What have you there, CapUaine Tay-</p><p>lor?” he cried as the Grayuring swung to </p><p>anchor of! his wharf. “A trap haul for me, </p><p>perhaps?” </p><p> “Aye, Peter, a record haul of one hundred</p><p>and twenty-five quintals for a trap of that </p><p>size, all alive and kicking, yours at the </p><p>current figure,” proffered Taylor. “And no </p><p>damp or Madeira about them—no, nor any </p><p>Miquelon brandy either!” </p><p> Peter grinned a deep grin that wrinkled</p><p>his sanctimonious face. </p><p> “Voild, I was drunk last night, but I</p><p>am sober and penitent today,” he declared </p><p>piously. “Oui, and the Auk is many souls </p><p>lighter and gone on her way to Camp </p><p>Islands. It would have been a pity to drag </p><p>a hole through a bag like that. My room </p><p>is ready, CapUaine, and I’ll send the carteel </p><p>boat out for your fish. No, you can’t </p><p>moor alongside till I get the harbor-end</p><p>of my jetty in place. Comment? You </p><p>know how much there was to do.” </p><p> Peter stumped down the wharf to give his</p><p>orders, and immediately the carteel boat, </p><p>a long fish-barge used to freight the catches </p><p>from the fishing-grounds to the rooms, </p><p>put out in charge of homespun-jacketed </p><p>livyeres. The morning haul of the Gray- </p><p>wing was dumped in and conveyed across </p><p>the harbor, Taylor himself riding his own </p><p>dory, trailed by the carteel boat with the </p><p>livyeres and the Graywing’s men aboard, </p><p>in to old Peter’s stage. </p><p> As he approached the straddling skeleton</p><p>of the stage which was built of longers he </p><p>scanned it for the first glimpse of the </p><p>roomies Laval was working. Surely, Tay- </p><p>lor thought, with all his riches, hard-fisted </p><p>though he was, old Peter would hardly </p><p>work his own womenkind in a room like </p><p>this. Surely he would not—by Jove, yes, </p><p>he would, too! Yonder was the slim sway- </p><p>ing of a figure he had seen before! </p><p> Three laden dories ahead of the carteel</p><p>boat were pewing the last of their loads to </p><p>the stage, and there in the stagehead </p><p>position stood Marie passing the gleaming </p><p>cod along a chute to the cutthroat old Anne. </p><p>Her double-bladed knife flashing in the </p><p>sunlight, old Anne in two strokes nicked </p><p>each fish on either side of the neck, with a </p><p>third slash ripped each belly open and </p><p>slung the mangled carcass along to the </p><p>header. </p><p> The header was a quarter-breed Eskimo</p><p>woman, leathered, wrinkled, impressive as </p><p>a Buddha, who pulled heads off and en- </p><p>trails out, separated the livers with won- </p><p>derful dexterity, dropped each liver into </p><p>the liver puncheon and slid the disem- </p><p>boweled fish on for the final operation of </p><p>splitting. </p><p> The'splitter, a full-blooded Montagnais</p><p>squaw with one hand mittened, boned the </p><p>cod with three lightning slashes and slapped </p><p>them into a large vat whence her fourteen- </p><p>year-old boy wheeled them in a dredge </p><p>barrow away to the fish-sheds to lie a month </p><p>under salt in layers three deep before being </p><p>dried. </p><p>IT WAS an efficient crew of roomies</p><p>old Peter worked. From stage to </p><p>salt bulk there was no pause in the </p><p>glittering stream of cod—not till the carteel </p><p>boat with the trailing dory swung up to </p><p>the wharf and Marie raised her eyes to look </p><p>fairly into Taylor’s. </p><p> “Mon Dieul” she gasped.</p><p> Taylor shuddered inwardly at sight of</p><p>her slim loveliness in the ugly mess, but he </p><p>carried himself boldly in the awkward </p><p>moment. </p><p> “Good morning, Mademoiselle Marie,”</p><p>he greeted, seeming not to see the smatter </p><p>The Foaming Fore Shore </p><p>ii </p><p>and slime, “I have brought your father </p><p>a trap haul to handle for me.” </p><p> “Bon matin, Capitaine Taylor,” she</p><p>returned, swiftly recovering herself. “You </p><p>must be a mighty fisher.” </p><p> But her involuntary halt in her work had</p><p>balked the rapid machine. The pitch- </p><p>forked fish piled up on her, the cutthroat </p><p>old Anne and the rest waved idle knives </p><p>in the air, and old Peter let out a roar like </p><p>a bull. </p><p> “Name of a name, Marie!” he bellowed.</p><p>“Do not stand there like a rock pillar with </p><p>a dozen quintal of fish at your feet. Diable, </p><p>move them along!” </p><p> Marie flushed scarlet, her face like some</p><p>rare, delicate crimson flower among the </p><p>silver gleam of the cod, and Taylor saw </p><p>the fire leap to her eyes as she shot a wicked </p><p>side-glance at her father. Taylor himself </p><p>had only one thought—to get her out of </p><p>that mess, but he was too shrewd to try </p><p>to bully old Peter or to appeal to his better </p><p>nature. Laval was not a man to be bullied </p><p>or influenced by appeals. To move him </p><p>one had to speak in terms of his pocket- </p><p>book. </p><p> “But look, Peter,” he argued, “your</p><p>Marie is too slight for such rush work. </p><p>I have a big trap haul here and very likely </p><p>another coming by evening. Let me put </p><p>one of my own men in her place. Let me </p><p>put Hughie Hay here, as good a stagehead </p><p>as ever kept the dories forking. It is in </p><p>my own interest and with Hughie on the </p><p>stage it will be better for you as well.” </p><p>“But the pay,” demurred old Peter. </p><p>“Marie gets nothing, for wild, it is the </p><p>return she gives me for her St. John’s </p><p>schooling.” </p><p> “Hughie gets his wage and share as one of</p><p>the Graywing’s crew whether afloat or </p><p>ashore,” Taylor hastened to assure him. </p><p>“He will cost you nothing.” </p><p> “Tris bien, then, let him take Marie’s</p><p>place,” accepted old Peter with alacrity. </p><p> Hughie sprang out and took the girl’s</p><p>position as stagehead, while Marie turned </p><p>to Taylor, a wonderful light of gratitude </p><p>in her eyes. He had extricated her quickly </p><p>and neatly from her demeaning bondage </p><p>without touching her pride, and she was </p><p>not loath to let him see that she admired </p><p>his delicacy. </p><p> “Ah, mon Viking of the Auk, how can I</p><p>thank you?” she breathed gratefully, yet </p><p>with something of coquettishness. </p><p> “Why, by taking Hughie’s place aboard</p><p>the Graywing,” laughed Taylor. </p><p> With a touch of gallantry he handed her</p><p>down into his dory under old Peter’s icicle- </p><p>like but unprotesting eyes. </p><p> “The schooner has nothing to do till the</p><p>trap haul this evening, so till then I’ll just </p><p>take you for a holiday cruise ’round </p><p>Chateau Bay!” </p><p>CHAPTER VIII </p><p>UNLAWFUL MESH </p><p>AND what a cruise and what a holiday </p><p>it was! And what a respite for Marie </p><p>—the clean deck of the trim Graywing </p><p>under her feet in place of the slimy stage, </p><p>the savory sea breeze in her nostrils in lieu </p><p>of the reek of disemboweled cod, the laugh- </p><p>ing voice of this great Viking of a sea </p><p>captain in her ears instead of the snarling </p><p>admonitions of her parental slave-masters, </p><p>old Peter and old Anne! </p><p> Care-free, buoyant, joyful-mooded as the</p><p>sparkling sea itself, they poked the </p><p>schooner’s bowsprit into all the inner </p><p>harbors of Chateau Bay, into Henley, into </p><p>Antelope Tickle, into Pitt’s Arm; they </p><p>climbed the Devil’s Dining Table to glimpse </p><p>the sail-dotted panorama of the strait; and </p><p>finally brought up at evening in crimson- </p><p>cliffed Red Bay twenty miles to the west- </p><p>ward. </p><p> Truly, a day of comradeship, of con-</p><p>fidences exchanged, of romance exotically </p><p>blossoming forth upon a romantic shore, a </p><p>shore steeped in lore and legend and storied </p><p>in love and feud. Here in the beginning the </p><p>Eskimos and Montagnais wooed and </p><p>warred, to be followed in peace and con- </p><p>flict by the English and French and, later</p><p>the northward-voyaging Americans, and </p><p>blood of these ancient coastwise adventurers </p><p>ran in the veins of both Taylor and Marie. </p><p> Yonder ruin of Fort Pitt, in Pitt’s Arm,</p><p>almost obliterated by the willow shrub- </p><p>bery—well, Taylor’s father was one of the </p><p>officers of the American privateer Minerva </p><p>which besieged it in 1778. That old </p><p>tumble-down fortress, Fort Greville, to the </p><p>northward of Henley Island over there— </p><p>voild,, few knew anything about it, but Marie </p><p>could tell. Her granduncle on her mother’s </p><p>side, old Greville the planter, had built </p><p>it to keep the warlike Eskimos away from </p><p>his Breton colons. </p><p>12 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Such bonds and grounds of intimacy</p><p>they discovered by the score throughout the </p><p>day. The day had been a blazing jewel, </p><p>topaz-clear and diamond-bright, but at </p><p>evening a sulfur-colored mist came in from </p><p>the Atlantic and the wind began to rise. </p><p> “A dirty squall cornin’, Cap’n,”</p><p>prophesied Tom Halifax. </p><p> “You’re right, Tom,” agreed Taylor,</p><p>“and we’d better haul our trap and get in </p><p>to the shelter of Chateau before it blows </p><p>any worse.” </p><p> Accordingly, the slim Boston Jim as</p><p>lookout, the battered sealer Halifax re- </p><p>lieving Brown at the wheel, they bore away </p><p>through the yellowish mist for their trap- </p><p>berth near York Point. </p><p> “Sight the buoys, Boston?” demanded</p><p>Taylor as the schooner, fleet as the wind </p><p>itself, flitted ghostlike from fog bank to </p><p>fog bank. </p><p> “Aye, Captain, I reckon I have their</p><p>range this minute,” Boston Jim sang out. </p><p>“Aye, in an open patch I have them. But </p><p>there’s a schooner lyin’ off it! Aye, and a </p><p>dory underrunnin’ the floats! Luks like </p><p>somebody helpin’ themselves to our fish.” </p><p>While he sang out Boston Jim lost sight </p><p>of the trap berth, but plunging through a </p><p>fog bank half a mile wide, the Graywing </p><p>soared once more into a clear water space </p><p>not two cable-lengths from the trap. </p><p>Riding the clear space, her topsails wreathed </p><p>in the scud that blew high overhead like </p><p>smoke, Taylor recognized the Esperance, </p><p>Admiral Pellier’s auxiliary vessel, with </p><p>her skipper Codroy John in charge. In </p><p>the lowered dory that was underrunning </p><p>his floats he saw Jacques Beauport and </p><p>Admiral Pellier himself, not hauling as </p><p>Boston Jim had suspected but evidently </p><p>inspecting the mesh of the net. </p><p> With a growl in his throat Taylor barked</p><p>tart orders to his men, and, folding her </p><p>wings like a gull alight, his schooner lay to </p><p>alongside the Esperance. </p><p> “What in blazes does this mean, Pellier?”</p><p>he roared at the dory in a mighty wrath.</p><p>“Who gave you authority to touch that net?” </p><p>“The law, Capiiaine Taylor,” Pellier sent </p><p>back. “Jacques Beauport brought word to </p><p>the Groix in the harbor that you were </p><p>using two-and-one-half-inch mesh, and I </p><p>came out to seize your trap.” </p><p> “Then Jacques Beauport is a cursed liar</p><p>and you are a plagued fool to believe any </p><p>tale he brings]” Taylor raged. “I hauled </p><p>that trap just this morning. The mesh </p><p>was the lawful three-inch then, and it hasn’t </p><p>shrunk since!” </p><p> TAYLOR wheeled in his fury to</p><p> grasp the boat tackles and slam a</p><p> dory overside.</p><p> “I’ll put Pellier and Beauport back on</p><p>the deck where they belong in one blazing </p><p>minute,” he promised Marie. </p><p> “But let me go, too,” she begged, and</p><p>dropped into the dory with him as the boat </p><p>rose upon the swell. “I’m going too. </p><p>There was a net seized in Chateau Harbor </p><p>this morning, Antoine Lefevre’s, so my </p><p>father said—oui, and a two-and-one-half- </p><p>inch mesh, if you please! Could it be sub- </p><p>stitution, Capitaine? That Jacques is a </p><p>dark one when he has a grudge. Maybe </p><p>he has taken up your own, set Lefevre’s </p><p>to catch you and brought the admiral to </p><p>see.” </p><p> “By heavens, if he has I’ll brain him!”</p><p>vowed Taylor. </p><p> With a surge he drove the dory along</p><p>the line of floats toward the other craft, </p><p>rowing so viciously that Beauport held up </p><p>a warning hand. </p><p> “It’s no use making such a pretty fuss,</p><p>Capitaine” he warned. “We have the </p><p>size of your mesh. Oui, ask Codroy John, </p><p>there, whom any man well knows does </p><p>not lie. Two and one-half, is it not, Codroy </p><p>John?” </p><p> “Aye, it be two and one-half,” boomed</p><p>Codroy John from the deck of the Esper- </p><p>ance. “I’d like to die if it do measure a </p><p>twine-breadth more.” </p><p> Taylor seized the floats and hauled in a</p><p>few feet of the net.</p><p> “It’s not my trap,” he vehemently de-</p><p>clared. “It’s not the trap I hauled in this </p><p>spot this morning. My own has been </p><p>lifted and this one dropped in its place.” </p><p>“Mon Dieu, a fine fairy-story,” chortled </p><p>Pellier. “Buoyed by your buoys but not </p><p>your net, eh? Ho! Ho! That is a new </p><p>plea for law-breakers.” </p><p> “No, it’s not my net,” gritted Taylor.</p><p>“My buoys, but not my trap!” </p><p> “Then whose is it, pray?” scoffed Pellier.</p><p>“Antoine Lefevre’s, most likely,” flashed </p><p>Marie. “And Capitaine Taylor’s is most </p><p>likely stored away where it will not be found. </p><p>Ask Jacques Beauport, there. He was the </p><p>man who seized it this morning and—and </p><p>used it again!” </p><p>The Foaming Fore Shore </p><p>13 </p><p> Pellier’s eyes turned inquiringly on</p><p>Jacques. </p><p> “Ciell” exploded Jacques, the fire flaming</p><p>in his eyes. “Do you and your Yankee </p><p>Capitaine insinuate that I—that I-” </p><p> “Yes,” cut in Taylor, “you exchanged</p><p>them either on your own or some one else’s </p><p>bidding.” </p><p> Beauport choked, his swarthy face</p><p>reddish-purple in his rage. </p><p> “Canaille—canaille! Fils du diablel”</p><p>he anathematized. “Nomme de-” </p><p> Taylor’s swinging oar stopped short his</p><p>epithets. Pellier and Jacques had just </p><p>time to duck low before the swishing spruce </p><p>blade scarred their dory gunwale. And </p><p>before they could raise their heads anew </p><p>or seize a weapon, Taylor, bringing his </p><p>bludgeon ’round in its arc again, stove their </p><p>whole bow with a terrific blow. </p><p> Pellier and Beauport floundered in the</p><p>water, yelling for help from the Esperance, </p><p>and Taylor looked up to find the schooner </p><p>footing forward under sail. At the first </p><p>sign of altercation Codroy John had slipped </p><p>her in between the schooner Graywing and </p><p>the two dories at the trap. Taylor and </p><p>Marie were cut off from their vessel, and it </p><p>seemed for a moment that the Esperance’s </p><p>crew might seize him in the name of the law </p><p>along with his trap. </p><p> But his own crew on the Graywing were</p><p>likewise watchful. They moved when Cod- </p><p>roy John moved, cracking on full sail in </p><p>the howling squall so that the schooner </p><p>leaped across the foamy wave-crests, out- </p><p>pointed the Esperance and drew a length </p><p>clear. </p><p> Then swinging on her heel, the Graywing</p><p>came about on the other tack, threatening </p><p>to shave the Esperance’s bows as she </p><p>crossed the auxiliary vessel’s course. </p><p> Tom Halifax was yelling Codroy John</p><p>warning to alter his course, but Codroy </p><p>refused to shift a point. His aim was to </p><p>blanket the dory, seize its two occupants,</p><p>pick up the pair of floundering men and </p><p>drive on before the Graywing could give </p><p>Taylor any aid. </p><p> “All right, then, I’ll bump your old</p><p>wagon!” bellowed Tom. </p><p> He cut fairly across the Esperance’s bows.</p><p>There was the high-pitched whine of taut, </p><p>chafing sheets, the sullen grind of timbers, </p><p>a medley of cries and a volley of oaths in </p><p>French, and the next moment the Gray- </p><p>wing’s bowsprit crashed out the Esperance’s </p><p>foremast in a trailing jumble of wreckage. </p><p> The big foresail, sagging overside, held</p><p>her like a sea-anchor, while the Graywing </p><p>swept clear and apparently unharmed, </p><p>luffed up in the gale of wind. </p><p> Taylor, heaving his dory alongside with</p><p>his one undamaged oar, rose on the crest </p><p>of a wave. Kerrigan and Patterson, wait- </p><p>ing tackles in hand, hooked on and brought </p><p>him, Marie, dory and all on deck with a </p><p>run. </p><p> “We’ve lost our trap, and we’ll lose our</p><p>schooner too, if we don’t get to shelter!” </p><p>Taylor shouted the moment he struck the </p><p>deck. “Crack on all you’ve got and run </p><p>into Chateau!” </p><p>EVEN as he spoke Tom Halifax’s </p><p>cry rose above the howl of the </p><p>wind. </p><p> “ ’Ware the mainmast! Yon rough work</p><p>must ’a’ cracked her! Look out, she’s foulin’ </p><p>the fore boom!” </p><p> Taylor wheeled to see the main boom</p><p>poised weirdly in air, with the mainmast </p><p>sagging on to the foremast and adding its </p><p>windage in a terrific strain. </p><p> “Axes, boys o’ mine!” he yelled. “Jump</p><p>lively there!” </p><p> But as the swinging blades of half a dozen</p><p>of the crew hit into the tangle, the added </p><p>windage told. The foremast gave sud- </p><p>denly with an explosive snap, and both </p><p>masts and both booms with their ballooning </p><p>sails crashed over the starboard rail. </p><p> The Graywing heeled till the rail went</p><p>under. It seemed for a second that she </p><p>would never rise out of the trough of the </p><p>seas, but Taylor, with a warning word to </p><p>Marie to hold tight, rushed away from her </p><p>with an ax snatched from the hand of one </p><p>of his men. He sprang upon the slanting </p><p>stump of the foremast, at the same time </p><p>yelling orders in the tumult of the breaking </p><p>seas. </p><p> “Cut her clear, boys o’ mine!” he clar-</p><p>ioned, his bright blade cleaving in a circle </p><p>of light about his head. </p><p> It was wild work in a wall of spray for</p><p>a moment, and Marie caught her breath, </p><p>her eyes on Taylor like a true Viking in </p><p>storm or boarding clinging to the stump </p><p>of the foremast, his fair head steel-haloed </p><p>by his ax, hurling the wreckage adrift </p><p>while the wind rose, bringing with it the </p><p>menace of floe-ice hurtling down. The </p><p>Esperance, in as bad a plight as they, </p><p>14 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>threatened every moment to drift down on </p><p>them. Her crew had hauled Pellier and </p><p>Beauport aboard and were cutting their own </p><p>wreckage free when the Graywing slowly </p><p>righted and Marie drew her breath again. </p><p> “Men Dieu, that was dangerous,” she</p><p>gasped. </p><p> “All over now!” cried Taylor.</p><p> Laughing like the Viking he was, he</p><p>sprang back to her side as the foremast </p><p>stump assumed a vertical position again and </p><p>slid him back on to the deck. </p><p> “Rig a couple of trysails on those</p><p>stumps,” he ordered, a wary eye on the </p><p>Esperance all clear and hard abeam. </p><p> Like magic the emergency sails fluttered</p><p>on and drew, the stumps of fore and main </p><p>like two dwarfed jury masts, and craftily, </p><p>swept continually by the baffled sea, the </p><p>Graywing crept from the menace of wave </p><p>and wind and floe into the quiet of Ch&amp;teau </p><p>harbor. Hard in her wake the Esperance </p><p>snailed in under similar rig, and for an </p><p>instant the two vessels rode rail to rail </p><p>before rounding to their anchorage off </p><p>Peter Laval’s long jetty. </p><p> “Well, Pellier,” shouted Taylor, “this</p><p>is what comes of Beauport’s trickery. A </p><p>nice mess it’s made of two fine schooners! </p><p>You’d better look to the whereabouts of </p><p>your men after this!” </p><p> Pellier, staring at Taylor with his far-</p><p>focused brown eyes as the Gloucester </p><p>captain lowered a dory and prepared to </p><p>row Marie ashore answered not a word, </p><p>but when the dory touched old Peter’s </p><p>wharf the admiral beckoned Jacques Beau- </p><p>port to him and closeted himself with him </p><p>in the Esperance’s cabin. </p><p>CHAPTER IX </p><p>THE TOAST </p><p>THE dark was down on shore as Taylor’s </p><p>dory touched old Peter’s wharf, the </p><p>soaring crests of the wooded hills lost in </p><p>the black murk of a stormy sky, the cheery</p><p>fights of Chateau pricking like golden stars </p><p>through the scudding fog. About Peter’s </p><p>room burned evil-smelling kerosene flares, </p><p>one on the stagehead, one at the cutthroat’s </p><p>stall and one at the splitter’s table. In the </p><p>faint glow of the farther flare worked the </p><p>Montagnais squaw splitting the last of the </p><p>day’s catch, her fourteen-year-old boy </p><p>coming and going beside her as he had done </p><p>since dawn, his dredge barrow bumping </p><p>and squeaking dolefully in the night. </p><p> At the splitter’s table old Anne was</p><p>cleaning her knives on a wad of tow, </p><p>whetting them keen and sticking them in </p><p>the slabs, ready for the morrow. While on </p><p>the stagehead, the final fish shot away, </p><p>Hughie Hay leaned on his fork beside old </p><p>Peter and stared in a vain attempt to make </p><p>out the strange rigs of the schooners that </p><p>had just cast anchor. </p><p> “Mon Dieu, it is you two, then,” cried</p><p>old Peter as Taylor and Marie climbed out </p><p>on the stage. “What have you done to </p><p>your Graywing, Capitaine? We couldn’t </p><p>see well for the fog, but I know it is not the </p><p>rig you sailed out under this morning.” </p><p> “No, I had a brush with Pellier’s Esper-</p><p>ance and we both lost some sticks,” laughed </p><p>Taylor. </p><p> “Diablet You tell me so? Come into</p><p>the lean-to and let us hear about it.” </p><p> With a word to Hughie Hay to take</p><p>charge of the dory and wait for him, Taylor </p><p>followed old Peter and Marie over the </p><p>wooden jetty. The slipperiness of the cod </p><p>was underfoot, the reek of the cod in their </p><p>nostrils, and involuntarily Marie shuddered. </p><p>This was what she had left for a golden day. </p><p>This was what she had come back to. The </p><p>thought of taking fork in hand at dawn </p><p>once more and standing there on the stage- </p><p>head nauseated her and a wild desire to </p><p>flee the whole thing filled her impulsive </p><p>being. </p><p> The lean-to backed the fish-sheds, and</p><p>through a doorway all sagged askew they </p><p>entered Peter’s Chateau home. Of a truth </p><p>it was but a Summer home, occupied during </p><p>the fishing-season and deserted while he </p><p>spent the Winter at Bay of Islands on the </p><p>Newfoundland shore, but nevertheless its</p><p>starkness and squalidity struck Taylor like </p><p>the blow of a dirty hand. </p><p> A tin lantern hung from the low roof</p><p>casting a feeble light as if ashamed to </p><p>glaringly illuminate the rude habitation </p><p>and display its shortcomings to visitors. </p><p>Through holes in the roof the fog was </p><p>dripping, hitting the hot top of the lantern </p><p>with a sputter or streaking down the un- </p><p>rinded timbers that held together the </p><p>aperture-filled walls. Underfoot a slab </p><p>floor bowed and sprung to the tread, a bare </p><p>floor, knotted, uneven, yawning with two- </p><p>inch cracks, littered with its own bark that </p><p>the foot skinned off at every step. </p><p>The Foaming Fore Shore </p><p>15 </p><p> As rough as the floor were the fixings that</p><p>stood upon it, a rusty, battered stove, a </p><p>spruce table adzed out in a solid slab with </p><p>trenailed legs and three stools to match. </p><p>A three-foot cut of a log, up-ended, served </p><p>as a washstand, supporting a granite basin </p><p>and a pot of soft yellowish soap under an </p><p>endless towel revolving on a roller. </p><p> At the farther end Taylor espied the</p><p>sleeping-quarters, walled off from the main </p><p>room by unplaned boards. These were </p><p>simply built-in bunks, and Taylor noted </p><p>with a thrill of pleasure the cleanly appear- </p><p>ance of Marie’s, its opening hung with </p><p>new curtains, her sea-chest within set out </p><p>for a dresser, her bed well-ordered. </p><p> Old Peter’s was primitive enough, having</p><p>neither curtains nor covering, his mattress </p><p>a layer of moss, but Taylor knew that the </p><p>hard-fisted old roomer was abroad night </p><p>and day, never removing his clothes and </p><p>sleeping with sea boots and oilskins on. </p><p>From old Anne’s he turned his eyes away, </p><p>for he espied a comforter that had not been </p><p>washed since her youth and deeper than </p><p>that he did not care to pry. </p><p> Yet old Peter might have been a sovereign</p><p>in a palace so merrily he laughed at Taylor’s </p><p>account of Beauport’s trickery. The pre- </p><p>dicament of the sly Jacques filled the hardy </p><p>old mariner with delight. </p><p> “Ciell” he chortled. “That Jacques</p><p>Beauport! He is the wily rascal. No </p><p>fool, Jacques, when it comes to anything </p><p>he wants. But he is caught this time. </p><p>But wait—you will see. Admiral Pellier is </p><p>a man of honor and fairness. Oui, and a </p><p>man of discipline. He will draw the truth </p><p>from Jacques as a man corkscrews a bottle </p><p>of brandy. VoUd, and that makes me </p><p>remember I am dry! Will you have some- </p><p>thing before you go, Capitaine?” </p><p> Old Peter stepped over to his bunk and</p><p>from a secret receptacle under the moss pro- </p><p>duced a bottle of brandy. </p><p> “Fresh from Miquelon?” inquired Taylor</p><p>with a laugh. </p><p> “Non, St. Pierre!” chortled old Peter.</p><p>“It is one of a case and there are many </p><p>cases—buried, you understand, where the </p><p>customs officer will never grub. Voire </p><p>health, CapitaineI Oui, and a full voyage </p><p>even if your trap is gone and your schooner </p><p>dismasted!” </p><p> “Your own health, Peter; aye, and a full</p><p>voyage!” returned Taylor, his eyes meeting </p><p>Marie’s. “Here’s hoping!” </p><p>CHAPTER X </p><p>THE RETURN OF THE ESPERANCE </p><p>VX7TIAT passed between Pellier and Beau- </p><p> *	’ port in the cabin of the Esperance the</p><p>fishers of Chateau never knew for a cer- </p><p>tainty, but they shrewdly surmised. For </p><p>in the fair weather of the next day the </p><p>auxiliary vessel in charge of Codroy John </p><p>crossed the strait under a single stick for </p><p>repairs at Ilumbermouth. Furthermore, </p><p>Jacques Beauport and six men of the Groix </p><p>went with her, and at that Chateau tongues </p><p>commenced wagging. It was plain enough! </p><p> Voild, they all knew Marie Laval had</p><p>another suitor, one at last whom she did not </p><p>flout! Jacques Beauport, the observant, </p><p>the cunning, had tried to get rid of him at a </p><p>stroke, but Jacques had gone too far with </p><p>his trickery and the admiral had taken a </p><p>hand. How honorable, that man Pellier! </p><p>The desire of his heart likely to be snatched </p><p>away, and yet he had not countenanced </p><p>the opportunity to take unfair advantage </p><p>of his rival! </p><p> Oui, Jacques Beauport and the six who</p><p>had helped him change Capitaine Taylor’s </p><p>net in secret were going across to be dis- </p><p>ciplined at the Fishery Protection Service </p><p>headquarters at Humbermouth, over on </p><p>the Humber arm of Bay of Islands, New- </p><p>foundland. </p><p> Indeed, it seemed that the Chateau</p><p>tongues were right, for Taylor heard no </p><p>more about the charge of using unlawful </p><p>mesh in strait waters. His seine was not </p><p>returned, in all probability because Beau- </p><p>port had destroyed it, but he himself was </p><p>not molested. As for Marie, she did not </p><p>go back to her stagehead position on old </p><p>Peter’s wharf. Taylor saw to that. </p><p> Every day in the gray of the dawn</p><p>Hughie Hay took up her work at the room </p><p>while she spent her glorious freedom on </p><p>the Chateau hills or afloat on Chateau </p><p>Bay. The Graywing being under repairs </p><p>in the harbor itself, Taylor had com- </p><p>missioned a trap skiff belonging to Laval </p><p>and with his handy craft he tended a fresh </p><p>trap, likewise bought in old Peter’s barter- </p><p>house, moored in his former trap-berth. </p><p>His luck ran riotously. The cod had </p><p>struck in in immense numbers. </p><p> Every day for three weeks and more was</p><p>a big fish day. On old Peter’s wharf the </p><p>knives flashed early and the kerosene flares </p><p>i6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>burned late while his vats bulged with </p><p>waterhorse and his acres of drying flakes </p><p>covered the bawn (beach). Every week, </p><p>and often twice a week, he shipped his </p><p>made fish on a foreigner to over-ocean ports </p><p>or chartered huge top-masted schooners </p><p>from Newfoundland’s East Coast to freight </p><p>it to Twillingate or Fogo. </p><p> And well he might! For the most</p><p>famous cod-grounds on the Labrador were </p><p>here on its southern fore shore, on the banks </p><p>and shoals of Belle Isle Strait! Slimed with </p><p>their food, the Chateau shoals drew the </p><p>teeming millions, and men of many nations </p><p>fished while the harvest held. From all </p><p>the Atlantic ports of the Union American </p><p>schooners flocked; from all the Newfound- </p><p>land outports all manner of sailing craft </p><p>came, stationers, floaters, trawlers, gallant </p><p>topmast schooners and ponderous brig- </p><p>antines. </p><p> Yet amid a horde of mighty fishers</p><p>Taylor maintained his reputation as the </p><p>greatest of them all. No man hauled more </p><p>quintals at a single haul than he, and no </p><p>man sent such catches slithering along old </p><p>Peter’s chutes. Between hauls he and his </p><p>crew worked on the Graywing. Like Corte- </p><p>real of old he cut tall masts from the hills, </p><p>and when everything was in readiness all </p><p>Chateau turned out to restep the schooner </p><p>and dance on her deck and old Peter’s </p><p>wharf in her honor as they christened her </p><p>brand-new canvas with strong waters of </p><p>the North. </p><p> A gay day that and a gay night with one</p><p>thousand craft in the Bay, and ten thousand </p><p>men and women on the beach. And king </p><p>and queen of the ten thousand were Capi- </p><p>taine Taylor and Marie Laval, Taylor </p><p>hoisting his flag to the foretop and Marie, </p><p>beautiful as a siren, spraying the new canvas </p><p>with a bottle of port and humming a little </p><p>sea song as she sprayed. </p><p>AS MARIE finished her song she </p><p>flung the empty bottle overside </p><p>and pointed toward the outer reach </p><p>of the harbor. </p><p> “Mon Dim—the Esperanceshe cried.</p><p>“As if the song called her—and what</p><p>mountainous freight has she got?” </p><p> Taylor turned to stare at Pellier’s</p><p>auxiliary vessel boasting a new foremast </p><p>and loaded with all the shining lumber </p><p>and gear of a modern room. Codroy John </p><p>was in charge and nowhere among her crew </p><p>were to be seen Jacques Beauport and the </p><p>six men who had sailed to Humbermouth </p><p>with him. Chateau tongues were right </p><p>indeed. Jacques was undergoing his dis- </p><p>cipline. </p><p> Yet Taylor’s wondering mind did not</p><p>dwell upon Jacques. He stared at the </p><p>magnificence of the cargo the Esperance </p><p>carried, the finest timbers, the most </p><p>luxurious fixings he had ever seen destined </p><p>for a room on the coast. </p><p> “Is it your father’s stuff, Marie?” he</p><p>asked. And as old Peter at that moment </p><p>rolled none too steadily down. the wharf </p><p>to meet the schooner, Taylor hailed him </p><p>with the query: “How now, Peter—have </p><p>you opened your heart at last? Yonder </p><p>are the makings of a palace aboard the </p><p>Esperance, and it must have cost you a good </p><p>many francs!” </p><p> “Diable, never a franc!” leered old Peter,</p><p>regarding him and Marie with maliciously </p><p>triumphant eyes. “It was paid for by </p><p>Admiral Pellier.” </p><p> “What?” demanded Taylor. “Is Pellier</p><p>forsaking the bridge for the planter’s </p><p>flakes?” </p><p> “Non!”</p><p> Laval shook his sou’westered head and</p><p>wiggled his chin in mirthful grimace so that </p><p>his fringe of white whisker wavered back </p><p>and forth. </p><p> “It is to replace my own old tumble-down</p><p>sheds. People have laughed and turned </p><p>up their offended noses at my room. Well, </p><p>wait till the old boards rattle down and </p><p>yonder gear goes up instead, and we will see </p><p>who cackles with laughter and casts the </p><p>merry eye. Mon Dieu,” laughing in </p><p>drunken raucousness, “does it surprise you, </p><p>then? Should a son-in-law not be so lavish </p><p>with his wealth? Voild, Pellier has spoken </p><p>to Anne and myself in the way of the French</p><p>for the hand of our daughter. The answer? </p><p>del, see there the marriage gift!” </p><p>CHAPTER XI </p><p>THE BARTER-HOUSE </p><p>“TISTEN for the end of the dance, </p><p>' Lance,” reminded Taylor as, half an </p><p>hour later, he slipped over the rail of the </p><p>Star of the Sea into his dory. “And watch </p><p>for the two boats and don’t lose a second. </p><p>The thing must be done in a flash before </p><p>Marie is missed. It’s a good job I stowed </p><p>The Foaming Fore Shore </p><p>17 </p><p>my made fish aboard as they came from </p><p>old Peter’s flakes. The Graywing is ready </p><p>for the sea except for some light tackle that </p><p>I’m going up to the barter-house to get.” </p><p>“Better be careful,” cautioned Lance in </p><p>farewell. “It’s a drunken gang Peter has </p><p>ashore. I’ll do my part, all right. Don’t </p><p>worry about that.” </p><p> Taylor pulled in to the wharf and zig-</p><p>zagging through the wild dance that was </p><p>petering out to an end, went on up to </p><p>Laval’s barter-house. As he stepped into </p><p>the lantern-lighted building that was </p><p>crammed with all manner of sea gear he </p><p>beheld old Peter himself and four of his </p><p>cronies chuckling over their half-emptied </p><p>glasses. </p><p> “Bon matin, Capitaine—seeing that</p><p>nearly all the night is spent,” gurgled old </p><p>Peter. “Come and pledge my daughter’s </p><p>health.” </p><p> “Another time, Peter, when the liquor</p><p>doesn’t run so strong,” evaded Taylor. </p><p>“I just dropped in for that light tackle </p><p>you put aside for me. The Graywing goes </p><p>to my trap-berth for this morning’s haul.” </p><p>“Here it is, then,” mumbled Laval. </p><p>“Give me a hand, camaradesl” </p><p> The five reached into a canvas-cluttered</p><p>corner of the barter-house. Their hands </p><p>flashed forth again, not with Taylor’s </p><p>tackle but with several yards of seine that </p><p>settled on his shoulders. Caught un- </p><p>awares, like a lion in a net, he hurled him- </p><p>self across the floor with the five clinging </p><p>desperately to the meshes that enveloped </p><p>him. </p><p> “Diable/” snarled old Peter. “You would</p><p>plan to elope with Marie—comment? You </p><p>would steal off in separate dories and let </p><p>Lance speak the words over your heads </p><p>from the rail of the Star of the Sea and then </p><p>dart south in the Graywing? Ciel, I am not </p><p>so drunk as you think, Capitaine. Non, but </p><p>sober enough to lurk in the shadow of the </p><p>Graywing’s sails and overhear you and </p><p>Marie. The end of the dance the moment, </p><p>too! Tres bien, then, there it is, the last </p><p>scrape of the fiddles!” </p><p> As he struggled Taylor heard the wail of</p><p>the violins die away, thumping feet leave </p><p>the wharf and singing dancers pass along </p><p>the beach. </p><p> “The end,” taunted old Peter, almost face</p><p>to face with him through the maze of </p><p>meshes yet with the protection of that </p><p>maze between. “Marie is stealing off in a </p><p>2 </p><p>dory. Oui, and I’ll tell you something. </p><p>The second dory is not lacking. It too is </p><p>stealing off, and Admiral Pellier is in it. </p><p> “Ho! Ho! Do you understand? It is</p><p>aboard the Esperance and not aboard the </p><p>Graywing she will go. Pellier has a chaplain </p><p>of his own, Blangard of the Groix, re- </p><p>member! A touch of wine and Marie will </p><p>never know the difference of clergy nor of </p><p>bridegrooms. Over their heads aboard the </p><p>Esperance, I say, Blangard will speak the </p><p>words, Blangard instead of Lance, and thus </p><p>it will save a lot of trouble with the stub- </p><p>bornness of Marie!” </p><p> Peter finished with a diabolical chuckle</p><p>at his own and Pellier’s cleverness—Pellier </p><p>the man of honor and fairness who fell be- </p><p>fore a mighty temptation when it came to </p><p>the stake of Marie. </p><p> Taylor felt a pang like the thrust of ice</p><p>in his heart. Then a red-hot surge of anger </p><p>flooded over him. </p><p> “You devil, Peter!” he roared, wrenching</p><p>to get his arms free from the binding seine. </p><p>“You cold-blooded, shoal-born, shoal- </p><p>slimed cod! First you barter her, and </p><p>then you try to marry her by a trick. </p><p>By-” </p><p> With the colossal heaving, with the</p><p>strength of a demon he rocked from wall </p><p>to wall of the barter-house, crashing its </p><p>trappings this way and that, dragging the </p><p>five backward and forward with the tre- </p><p>mendous Viking power that was in him. </p><p>Two of them he pinned against the wall </p><p>with his bulk and jerked off their feet in a </p><p>sudden lurch so that their side of his twine </p><p>prison was left for a second unweighted. </p><p>In that second he writhed his right arm </p><p>free and smashed old Peter full in the chest. </p><p>Peter staggered the width of the room and</p><p>fell backward upon a bundle of sailcloth, </p><p>and before he could clamber up Taylor </p><p>struck again and again and Peter’s two </p><p>cronies sprawled on top of him. </p><p>WHIPPING the seine into their </p><p>faces with a final swing Taylor </p><p>darted out of the barter-house door- </p><p>way before the other pair could stop him. </p><p>A riot raged in his heart as he ran down the </p><p>wharf, straining his eyes out toward the </p><p>Star of the Sea riding at anchorage amid </p><p>the harbor craft. Though the night-shadow </p><p>of the Chateau hills lay dark upon the </p><p>water, the approaching dawn was lightening </p><p>it a little, and he could discern the church </p><p>i8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>yacht and his own Graywing astern of </p><p>her. </p><p> There were no dories ’round the Star of</p><p>the Sea—he must be in time! A wave of </p><p>exultation swept him. A joyous cry burst </p><p>from his lips—to change the next moment </p><p>to a curse! ’Round the Star of the Sea’s hull, </p><p>the hull that had hidden them, broke two </p><p>dories, the one spinning adrift with nobody </p><p>in it, the other rocking to the struggling </p><p>of two swaying figures. </p><p> Pellier. Marie. He recognized them even</p><p>in the half-darkness, even before Marie’s </p><p>pitiful cry came across the harbor to him. </p><p> “Help, help!” she screamed. “It is Pel-</p><p>lier. He is taking-” </p><p> The rest was cut short, but Taylor had</p><p>heard enough. With a leap he was afloat, </p><p>sending his dory surging out. </p><p> “Lance, did you see?” he shrilled as he</p><p>boiled by the Star of the Sea. “Pellier got </p><p>her before she made your yacht. Peter </p><p>trapped me in the barter-house, but I broke </p><p>away.” </p><p> “But where,” yelled Lance, peering</p><p>after his dory through* the dark with his </p><p>short-sighted eyes, “where in the name of </p><p>Heaven is he taking her?” </p><p> “The Esperance!” Taylor snarled back.</p><p>“He’ll ply her with wine and the Groix’s </p><p>chaplain will marry them.” </p><p> At Taylor’s information Lance threw up</p><p>his hands in holy horror, a fantom of </p><p>supplication in the gloom, but Taylor him- </p><p>self was past the Star of the Sea and away, </p><p>driving his dory like a madman to overtake </p><p>the struggling pair ahead, when like a moth </p><p>out of the dusk the Esperance, her deck- </p><p>load discharged and trimmed for speed, </p><p>winged in between. </p><p> Taylor heard the metallic clash of</p><p>tackles. Under full sail the schooner </p><p>heaved the dory and the two figures in on </p><p>the run and drove on out of Chateau harbor. </p><p>Like a moth she went, and like the black </p><p>bat that flits in the wake of the moth the</p><p>warship Groix slipped after. </p><p> “Convoyed, Capitaine,” half-cackled,</p><p>half-croaked the voice of old Peter from </p><p>his wharf, “oui, convoyed to a place where </p><p>your Graywing dare not poke. The honey- </p><p>moon’s at Humbermouth!” </p><p> His red wrath gone with the flicker of the</p><p>Espcrance’s sails, suddenly left white and </p><p>trembling, Taylor turned his eyes shoreward </p><p>to see old Peter dimly outlined on his stages </p><p>by one of his kerosene flares, one hand to </p><p>his croaking chest that was still heaving in </p><p>asthmatic jerks from the effect of the </p><p>Gloucester captain’s blow. </p><p> White and trembling, his red wrath gone</p><p>but with the spirit passion that glows like </p><p>the white heat of fused metal, he shook his </p><p>fist at the planter. </p><p> “You’ve taken her, you and Pellier!” he</p><p>answered. “You’ve stolen her from me, </p><p>Peter, but as sure as the sea winds blow and </p><p>the tides turn I’ll come again to Chateau </p><p>to take her back!” </p><p>CHAPTER XII </p><p>FULL VOYAGE </p><p>AND Taylor came, not that season for </p><p>•	the Autumn gales completely closed</p><p>the fore shore to sailing craft, nor the next </p><p>for Marie sent him private word to Glouces- </p><p>ter of the motherhood that was forced upon </p><p>her like the marriage, but the following </p><p>Spring! On the heels of Winter he came </p><p>winging through the strait, threading the </p><p>maze of icebergs grounded on the shoals </p><p>just off Chateau and drove into the harbor </p><p>itself. </p><p> His vow had gone ringing from man to</p><p>man along the foaming seaboard. The whole </p><p>coast was agog for his coming. Day by </p><p>day Marie had kept vigil from Beacon </p><p>Hill, and day by day the admiral, old </p><p>Peter and the disciplined Jacques Beauport </p><p>had taken council against the lifting of the </p><p>Graywing’s sails. Jacques had been put </p><p>on patrol duty with the Esperance, and </p><p>Jacques it was who sighted Taylor’s </p><p>schooner off York Point and brought the </p><p>news with a rush to Pellier and old Peter</p><p>on the latter’s new wharf. </p><p> “Voild, the Graywing, sir!” he reported</p><p>dramatically, drawing himself up proudly </p><p>on the planed boards. </p><p> “The devil,” growled Pellier, wheeling</p><p>from his talk with old Peter. “Where </p><p>now?” </p><p> Beauport pointed where the schooner,</p><p>hard in the Esperance's wake, was pushing </p><p>through the ice barrier. So close the </p><p>barrier bulked that it ringed ’round the </p><p>harbor like a wall. Three days it had lain </p><p>thus, shutting in the French warship </p><p>Groix, another French gunboat and two </p><p>British cruisers on the fisheries patrol. </p><p>Big hulks could not negotiate the narrow </p><p>passage where deftly handled schooners </p><p>The Foaming Fore Shore </p><p>19 </p><p>slipped through, nor did the sullen berg </p><p>show any sign of shifting. </p><p> Close-hauled, with her booms well in-</p><p>board to miss the chasm-like walls of the </p><p>bergs, the Graywing burst the barrier, the </p><p>sunset flaming on her sails and on the fair </p><p>head of the Viking Taylor at the wheel. </p><p>Handling the sheets those on the wharf </p><p>saw the well-known forms of his sturdy </p><p>crew: the adolescent Hughie Hay, the ex- </p><p>pectorating Irish Kerrigan, the parson-like </p><p>Boston Jim, the lopped-off Titan Patterson, </p><p>the braw McCaig, the battered sealer Hali- </p><p>fax, the wizened Brown. </p><p> Instantly at sight of the schooner the</p><p>Chateau beach took up the news, fisher </p><p>calling to fisher and bark hailing nearby </p><p>bark. </p><p> "Mon Dieu, it is the Graywing of Glouces-</p><p>ter come back!” </p><p> “Oui, I told one hundred of you that</p><p>Capitaine Taylor would keep his oath!” </p><p>“Name of a name, then Admiral Pellier </p><p>had better to look to himself or he will be </p><p>left alone. What will the proud man do?” </p><p>Pellier heard the medley of comments, </p><p>and his face flushed. </p><p> “Do?” he grated to Laval and Beauport.</p><p>“I will show these fools! Peter, they must </p><p>not meet—Taylor and Marie. I must seize </p><p>his schooner before he can work any devil- </p><p>try!” </p><p> “That will not be hard,” ventured the</p><p>fathomless Beauport. </p><p> “Name a charge, then, Jacques,” flashed</p><p>old Peter. “You were always quick of wit </p><p>in these things.” </p><p> “Why,” prompted Jacques, “there is the</p><p>matter of his voyage here two years ago. </p><p>It is against the law for an American to </p><p>load fish not caught and cured by people </p><p>of the United States, and he loaded with fish </p><p>you cured yourself, Peter!” </p><p> “Ho! Ho!” exclaimed old Peter, grinning</p><p>hugely. “You hear, Pellier? Jacques has </p><p>a long memory. You can trump up no</p><p>better excuse than that. Seize his Gray- </p><p>wvng at once and hand it over to the British </p><p>cruisers to take to St. John’s. The Lab- </p><p>rador is their shore, and theirs is the </p><p>administering of its law. Ciel, the Ad- </p><p>miralty Court is sometimes slow. Com- </p><p>prenez-vous? The Graywing may rot in </p><p>the harbor of St. John’s before its case is </p><p>heard, and while it is rotting it can not carry </p><p>anybody off from Chateau.” </p><p> "Dieu," growled Pellier with a whip-like</p><p>cracking of his fingers, “it goes against my </p><p>grain, but I will do it. It is either that </p><p>AND he finished his sentence with </p><p>a reckless shake of his head as he </p><p>put off to the Groix. Immediately </p><p>the Groix got under way, and as Taylor </p><p>boldly rounded to his old anchorage off </p><p>Laval’s new room, the warship crossed his </p><p>bows and dropped a boat full of men along- </p><p>side. </p><p> “Your schooner is seized, Capitaine</p><p>Taylor,” Pellier greeted him coolly from his </p><p>place in the sternsheets. </p><p> “For what?” roared Taylor, his wrath</p><p>abruptly blazing like the sun-set fires. </p><p> “For a breach of the Newfoundland navi-</p><p>gation laws,” announced the Admiral </p><p>vaguely. “I shall be compelled to hand </p><p>the Graywing over to these British cruisers </p><p>to be taken to St. John’s. You and your </p><p>crew will be set down by the Esperance at </p><p>the nearest American port. Get into the </p><p>boat and go aboard her!” </p><p> Pellier stepped on the Graywing’s after-</p><p>deck, old Peter Laval, Jacques Beauport, </p><p>Codroy John and a dozen more at his heels, </p><p>forming two guarding lines through which </p><p>the admiral beckoned captain and crew. </p><p> “Come quickly,” he ordered, waving a</p><p>hand to the Groix's guns frowning at point- </p><p>blank range. “There is no chance for </p><p>resistance.” </p><p> “You cowards!” stormed Taylor, clench-</p><p>ing his fists in their faces. “You scheming </p><p>whelps! Do you think you’re going to </p><p>drag me off my own deck like a dog? By </p><p>heavens, I’ll sink to the harbor bottom first, </p><p>Graywing and all!”</p><p> Defiant he crouched, his men ready set</p><p>behind him, itching to hurl themselves at </p><p>Pellier’s men, when Codroy John’s whisper </p><p>snarled in his ear. Codroy stood at the </p><p>foot of one of the guarding lines, nearest </p><p>to Taylor, and over his massive shoulder </p><p>he spat the words through his beard. </p><p> “In the name o’ the Lard, go aboard,</p><p>Captain!” he urged. “The Esperance be </p><p>as swift a schooner as your Graywing and </p><p>she do lie nearer to the stages. Will you </p><p>take a look?” </p><p> Taylor darted a furtive glance shore-</p><p>ward, and his blood leaped. On old </p><p>Peter’s stagehead stood Marie, with old </p><p>Anne by her side holding by the hand her </p><p>toddling granddaughter. Fearful lest Pellier </p><p>20 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>should see the burning in his eyes, the </p><p>violet flash in Marie’s, he turned his head </p><p>and searched Codroy John’s face. In- </p><p>stantly he read its friendliness, and he took </p><p>up the Terra Novan’s cue. </p><p> “I don’t know, boys o’ mine,” he spoke,</p><p>turning to his men with a show of inde- </p><p>cision but passing them a warning wink; </p><p>“when it comes down to the fine thing, </p><p>I don’t know. I don’t care for myself or </p><p>the schooner, but you fellows have kin </p><p>back home. I forgot that. It isn’t fair </p><p>to you. Maybe we’d better go aboard the </p><p>Esperance and fight our case with the law </p><p>instead of with our fists.” </p><p> “Now, that is something sensible, Capi-</p><p>taine” cut in Pellier, growing very uneasy </p><p>at the prospect of stubborn resistance. “It </p><p>is under the law I am acting, and you have </p><p>the very same privilege.” </p><p> “All right, then,” surrendered Taylor,</p><p>“just a minute to get the Graywing's log </p><p>and I’ll be with you. I’ll promise not to </p><p>dig up any weapons in the cabin, but send </p><p>a man with me for formality—Codroy </p><p>John, if you like!” </p><p> He was off to his cabin as he spoke,</p><p>Codroy John at his heels, anticipating the </p><p>admiral’s nod of assent for fear he should </p><p>depute some one else. </p><p> “Well, Codroy,” demanded Taylor, fac-</p><p>ing the Terra Novan in the closed cabin, </p><p>“are you with her or with them? With </p><p>her, I take it! And the Esperance is swift, </p><p>is she, and near the stages? But what </p><p>about the crew aboard her?” </p><p> “They be Newfoundlanders like myself,”</p><p>boomed Codroy John. “Aye, and like </p><p>myself they be with her. Godfather I </p><p>were to her, Captain Taylor, and I do love </p><p>her like the real father she never have had </p><p>or maybe like the—the—the real husband </p><p>she never have had. The admiral and old </p><p>Peter and Beauport do plan wonderful well, </p><p>but they do forget we Newfoundlanders be </p><p>God-fearing men. They have gone beyond </p><p>the law o’ God and man, and I will never </p><p>forgive them for tricking her till I do see </p><p>her back in your arms. The Esperance be</p><p>ready, Captain. Marie be on the wharf. </p><p>Will you take the chance?” </p><p> “Will I?” exploded Taylor, grabbing his</p><p>log. “Watch me, Codroy! Come on, be- </p><p>fore Pellier has a change of mind.” </p><p> The Graywing's log under his arm, he led</p><p>the way into the admiral’s waiting boat </p><p>and the rest of his men filed after. Pellier, </p><p>Peter, Beauport and the men of the Groix </p><p>took their places and the rowers sent the </p><p>craft foaming alongside the Esperance. </p><p>Taylor noted that the auxiliary vessel was </p><p>not at anchor, but laying to under foresail </p><p>and jib, and on her deck he glimpsed her </p><p>crew, six rugged Newfoundlanders whom </p><p>Codroy John had vouched for. </p><p> On to the Esperance's deck Pellier herded</p><p>them, stepping aft himself to give final </p><p>orders to his men before going back to the </p><p>Groix. The grinning Peter stepped with </p><p>him and Beauport, both anxious to see </p><p>the last of Taylor, but their last sight was </p><p>hardly what they bargained for. </p><p> “Overboard with them all!” Taylor yelled</p><p>before Pellier could give his orders. “Over- </p><p>board with them, boys o’ mine!” </p><p> With a roar of exultation his crew rushed</p><p>the men of the Groix, Codroy John and his </p><p>Newfoundlanders flocking to their aid, </p><p>stamping up and down the Esperance's </p><p>deck, smiting and wrestling at her rail, </p><p>Irish Kerrigan, Boston Jim, Patterson, </p><p>Brown, Hughie Hay, McCaig, Tom Halifax </p><p>and Bolero the cook, smothering Pellier’s </p><p>force in the unexpectedness of their attack </p><p>and hurling them into the harbor water. </p><p> Taylor himself was locked with the admi-</p><p>ral, old Peter and Jacques, fighting the three </p><p>as an ordinary person would fight a single foe. </p><p>Vainly they lunged and struck at him. </p><p>Viking that he was he laughed under their </p><p>blows, herding them to the Esperance's </p><p>rail and knocking Beauport sheer over it </p><p>with a lightning blow. Old Peter rushed </p><p>but toppled back from Taylor’s straight-arm </p><p>punch, caught his legs against the rail and </p><p>followed Beauport, while Pellier was plucked </p><p>from the deck in the Gloucester man’s </p><p>arms and cast overside. </p><p> “My turn now, Pellier!” Taylor shouted</p><p>as he splashed. “My turn, Jacques! My </p><p>turn, Peter, you foxy old devil!” </p><p>HE JUMPED for the Esperance's </p><p>wheel as he cried. His crew of the </p><p>Graywing and Codroy’s of the </p><p>Esperance were at the main-sheet hoisting </p><p>the big mainsail, and as he put over the </p><p>spokes he felt the clean-lined schooner an- </p><p>swer like his own. Half a cable’s length </p><p>away old Peter’s long wooden jetty ran out </p><p>into the water, Marie, old Anne and the </p><p>child on its edge. As the Esperance mo- </p><p>mentarily luffed up Marie suddenly leaped </p><p>the three-foot gap to the schooner’s rail. </p><p>The Foaming Fore Shore </p><p>21 </p><p> Across the slant of the afterdeck she slid,</p><p>panting with excitement, and Taylor, his </p><p>right hand on the wheel, caught her to him </p><p>with his left, holding her thus for a second </p><p>even as he held the schooner to the jetty. </p><p> “Marie, Marie, my flower of the coast!”</p><p>he breathed, his Viking blood pounding to </p><p>the thrill, to the danger, to the touch of her </p><p>clinging hands on his free arm and the whip- </p><p>ping of her hair against his cheek. “But </p><p>your child—the little Madeline?” </p><p>“My mother keeps her till things blow </p><p>clear and we are free, and then she will </p><p>bring her to me. She has turned to me at </p><p>the last, my mother, just as Codroy turned.” </p><p>“Good!” exulted Taylor. </p><p> “But the barrier,” cried Marie, “the ice-</p><p>barrier! I pray to God we may pass!” </p><p> She trembled against him, her violet eyes</p><p>were ablaze with the fire of a woman </p><p>awakened to the crisis of her life. Out </p><p>beyond yonder ring of icebergs lay the </p><p>open sea, a free path down to Gloucester, a </p><p>year of fretting under Pellier’s enforced </p><p>marriage yoke, then release and happiness </p><p>under the law. It was all that stood </p><p>between her and another life and through </p><p>the gap in the ice wall Pellier and his watch- </p><p>dog cruisers could not go. </p><p> Dieu, it was a stake! Dieu, how she</p><p>prayed and clung as Taylor steered for the </p><p>barrier under full sail! Chateau Harbor </p><p>was in a tumult, a thousand clamors rising </p><p>in the early dark that dropped suddenly as </p><p>the sun failed. The beach was a-roar with </p><p>fishers’ shoutings, a-rumble with the thud </p><p>of their feet as they ran to the stage heads </p><p>to keep the Esperance in sight. </p><p> Like a witch the schooner sailed. Through</p><p>the creeping dark and the swirl of mist that </p><p>came with the dark, her sails gleamed </p><p>white, pointing for the ice-barrier. Dead </p><p>ahead, the Groix’s boats were picking up </p><p>Pellier and his men and the second </p><p>French gunboat along with the two British </p><p>cruisers were moving from their moorings </p><p>to come to the Groix’s assistance. But </p><p>many crafts were in their way, schooners </p><p>and brigantines at anchor, and before the</p><p>war-ships could close the cordon the Es- </p><p>perance broke through in !zigzag tacking </p><p>and plunged for the gap amid the bergs. </p><p> Though the harbor surface was dark, the</p><p>glittering pinnacles of the bergs still caught </p><p>the rays of the sunken sun and glowed </p><p>blood-red like the spires of massed cathe- </p><p>drals in the dusk. On the ruby peaks </p><p>perched the resting sea-birds, puffins, guil- </p><p>lemots, gulls, razor-billed auks, all black </p><p>as ebony against the crimson afterglow, </p><p>their sleepy mutterings drowned by the </p><p>roar of the waves and the rumble of the </p><p>air in the ice caverns beneath them. </p><p> Like the crash of cannon rose the rumble</p><p>of the air as the Esperance approached the </p><p>passage. Like the roar of surf on a reef </p><p>broke the thunder of the swells across the </p><p>emerald ice ledges. But above these both, </p><p>another sound ripped through the air—the </p><p>belching guns of the cruisers. </p><p> “By heavens, is the madman firing at us?”</p><p>gasped Taylor. </p><p> “No, over us,” cried Marie, watching</p><p>the red flares of the racing gunboats. </p><p>“Over us—to close the passage. Don’t </p><p>you see? Mon Dieu, don’t take time to </p><p>close-haul or-” </p><p> The rest of her words were lost in the</p><p>bursting of shells on the ice pinnacles ahead, </p><p>in the wailing of startled seabirds and the </p><p>crash of tons of berg tips into the gap. </p><p> Marie was right. There was no time to</p><p>close-haul the schooner. </p><p> “Hold hard!” warned Taylor. “Every</p><p>man hold!” </p><p> Wing and wing he drove her at the cleft,</p><p>her foresail to starboard, mainsail to port, </p><p>the ends of her booms rasping great furrows </p><p>in the. ice wall that was crumbling under </p><p>the shelling. Ice fragments were raining </p><p>all about, and Taylor half-stooped at the </p><p>wheel over the crouching Marie, shielding </p><p>her with his body against the falling lumps. </p><p> A moment the Esperance wedged. Then</p><p>the vast drawing power of her canvas </p><p>together with the lift of the surge through </p><p>the gap carried her on. Her chafed booms</p><p>stood out again, and, the passage closed be- </p><p>hind her by falling pinnacles against all </p><p>craft large or small, the schooner was gone </p><p>in the dark of the open sea, driving wing </p><p>and wing for Gloucester. </p><p> So deep was the gloom through which</p><p>they bored that the sails and the very </p><p>masts themselves were lost in the murk </p><p>above. Even the sluiced decks seemed to </p><p>dissolve underfoot, taking the blurry forms </p><p>of the rest of the crew with them. </p><p> Taylor and Marie, isolated at the wheel,</p><p>seamen to skim a strange sea all their </p><p>own, even as their hearts skimmed a strange </p><p>new life all their own, driving southward </p><p>Viking-prowed down the foaming foreshore </p><p>of their love! </p><p>FoRTY-NINL </p><p>SO liberty </p><p>Pearj'cill </p><p>Urge of blood and drive of race, </p><p> Golden lure and wander call—</p><p>Strong men all, they clipped the pace, </p><p>To where the rivers westward fall, </p><p>’Cross jungle strip and desert bare; </p><p>And lo! They found an empire there. </p><p>R. J P. </p><p>I </p><p>(SSmSjEY, there, ye will-o’-the-wisp! </p><p>I Si Ha^erty!" </p><p>S M H It was good to hear that voice </p><p>again. John Haggerty, knap- </p><p>sacked, blanket-rolled, and grayish red with </p><p>the dust of forty miles, turned in time to see </p><p>the big Irishman that owned it coming </p><p>through the door of the Eldorado in a rush. </p><p>“Sheehy, you old reprobate,” and for a </p><p>moment there was nothing but hand- </p><p>shaking. </p><p>“Didn’t expect to see ye till mornin’,” </p><p>said Sheehy, then. “My stars, you’re an </p><p>annihilator of distance, lad.” </p><p>“Hardly that,” laughed Haggerty. But </p><p>indeed, he was as lean and hard as though </p><p>trained for a marathon. His youthful face </p><p>showed not the slightest sign of fatigue, and </p><p>he had entered the camp called “Grizzly” </p><p>free-jointed and easily. </p><p>Sheehy’s voice grew more sober as he </p><p>looked his friend over. </p><p>“But ye’ve changed some, lad,” he said, </p><p>“since the crossin’ of the Isthmus.” </p><p>“If I have, it’s all I’ve done,” said Hag- </p><p>gerty, a little ruefully. </p><p>“Except wandering all over like a soul </p><p>accursed,” amended Sheehy. “Ye’ll do no</p><p>good for yourself that way. Ye’d better </p><p>stop in Grizzly awhile and let whatever </p><p>you’re lookin’ for come to ye.” </p><p>“It’s a likely enough looking place for </p><p>tilings to happen,” replied Haggerty. </p><p>“Say,” grinned Sheehy, “the only certain </p><p>thing about Grizzly is its uncertainty. ’Tis </p><p>as full of explosive unexpectedness as the </p><p>belt ye pack. But come up to my shanty </p><p>where ye’ll sleep the night, and after ye’ve </p><p>deposited your baggage ye may have an- </p><p>other look.” </p><p>As the two started up the dusty street </p><p>together, Haggerty continued to study the </p><p>town curiously. </p><p>He thought he saw something unique </p><p>Author of “Danger Trail," "Square," etc. </p><p>Forty-Nine </p><p>23 </p><p>about it, although in its material aspects it </p><p>was like any other mushroom mining-camp, </p><p>hastily tumbled-up and helter-skelter, vig- </p><p>orous, disreputable, and altogether mascu- </p><p>line. Log huts, canvas-sided shacks and </p><p>“shake” shanties were strewn haphazardly </p><p>along one side of the wide trail. Plumped </p><p>down here and there were larger structures, </p><p>from which came the blare of hurdy-gurdies. </p><p>And among the men that thronged in and </p><p>out of these places there was the usual Sat- </p><p>urday evening joviality and pioneer camara- </p><p>derie, but there seemed something else, too. </p><p>Watchfulness, clannishness, suspicion, he </p><p>would have defined it; but he said nothing, </p><p>and followed Sheehy to his shack. </p><p> When they came out an hour later it was</p><p>quite dark. The street had grown quieter, </p><p>but loud talk and cascades of roaring laugh- </p><p>ter broke from the Eldorado, and wild- </p><p>looking silhouettes showed through its can- </p><p>vas walls. </p><p> Haggerty and Sheehy drifted from this to</p><p>several kindred places, and wound up in the </p><p>Golden Bear. All the time, Haggerty </p><p>played his usual part of total abstainer. He </p><p>studied the crowd closely, pursuing the </p><p>search that had become a fixed mental </p><p>habit with him; and while he looked he re- </p><p>newed his impression of the unusual. </p><p> After a while he was able to analyze it.</p><p>There was an unfamiliar element in the </p><p>crowd. Mingling with the boisterous mi- </p><p>ners, the pale-faced, passionless-eyed gam- </p><p>blers, and the inevitable rag-tag collection of </p><p>loafers and hangers-on, were numerous </p><p>others that seemed to have no place in a </p><p>mining-town. For one thing, their hands </p><p>were uncalloused and their heels spurred; </p><p>but more significant still was their peculiar </p><p>air of blended secrecy and challenge, and the </p><p>aloofness and even hostility with which the </p><p>regular miners treated them. </p><p> Obviously unearned though it was, these</p><p>men seemed to have plenty of gold. In the </p><p>Golden Bear they were so numerous that </p><p>Haggerty put his growing suspicion into a </p><p>question. </p><p> “What is this place,” he asked Sheehy,</p><p>“a mining-camp, or something else? I</p><p>didn’t think,” he added significantly, “there </p><p>was as much gold coin this side of the </p><p>divide.” </p><p> The bar at which they stood was lined</p><p>with noisy men, and behind them well- </p><p>patronized gambling-tables, wheels and </p><p>layouts filled the place to the door. Sheehy </p><p>looked swiftly over the crowded room, and </p><p>then drew Haggerty to an unoccupied cor- </p><p>ner near the end of the bar. </p><p> “I’ve been waitin’ for ye to ask me that,”</p><p>he said, in a cautious tone. “Ye heard of </p><p>some outlawry on the way up, maybe?” </p><p> “A lot of it,” replied Haggerty.</p><p> And, indeed, a flood of crime had recently</p><p>spread all over the up-country. Mysteri- </p><p>ous disappearances were common; the bod- </p><p>ies of men were found floating in streams, </p><p>their gold removed; express riders were held </p><p>up and shot; and a general era of deviltry </p><p>seemed to have set in. </p><p> “Well,” said Sheehy, “’tis the general</p><p>opinion that most of the trouble’s born </p><p>right here. This riff-raff ye see—about a </p><p>month ago they began to drift in on us. </p><p>About that time, too, ‘Black’ Doak comes </p><p>and buys this place, and ’tis here they make </p><p>their headquarters. Ye can see the cut- </p><p>throat faces of ’em, and they’ve no visible </p><p>means of support save the revolvers in their </p><p>belts, and there ye are. But there’s more </p><p>and more of ’em all the time, and any night </p><p>ye can hear ’em boastin’ in their cups of </p><p>what they would do to Grizzly if we run ’em </p><p>out. They wouldn’t go far, they say, havin’ </p><p>a hidin’-place near that no man could find </p><p>nor a regiment take.” </p><p> “This Black Doak, who’s he?” asked</p><p>Haggerty. </p><p> “Well, if ye ask me, he’s the leader of</p><p>’em,” said Sheehy. “If ye ask him, he’s </p><p>proprietor of this place and a respectable </p><p>business man. If ye ask the average miner, </p><p>ye’ll get but an earful of luridity, for he’s the </p><p>man that gets their gold to Sacramento for </p><p>’em, and charges a third for the service. </p><p>There was a pony express before his, </p><p>chargin’ but ten per cent., but ye may guess </p><p>what happened to the riders. Speakin’ in </p><p>general, he’s Grizzly’s man on horseback,</p><p>and a cornin’ millionaire, or a cornin’ orna- </p><p>ment to the end of a rope. And if ye will </p><p>look cornin’ through the door—that’s him.” </p><p>Haggerty looked. What his eyes saw was </p><p>a very large man with a dark, hard face, </p><p>glittering black eyes, and the general look of </p><p>the human wolf. What his mind regis- </p><p>tered was the end of a year-old chase, and </p><p>the promise of a rehabilitated life. </p><p> He stepped sharply forward, his eyes</p><p>flaming. And then as suddenly he stopped, </p><p>turned to Sheehy and asked in an anxious, </p><p>eager whisper- </p><p> “That’s Doak, you say?”</p><p>24 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Yes. What’s up, lad?”</p><p> Haggerty’s face expressed a torrent of</p><p>swift thoughts. Doak, the master of Griz- </p><p>zly! His quarry, caught at last and still be- </p><p>yond reach! A desperate riddle flashed </p><p>through Haggerty’s mind—a riddle that </p><p>must quickly be solved. He put part of it </p><p>in words to the astonished Sheehy: </p><p> “Don’t look at him. Now if any one</p><p>wanted—wanted anything out of him, </p><p>there’d be no way to get it in Grizzly, would </p><p>there?” </p><p> “Short of killin’ him,” said Sheehy, “there</p><p>wouldn’t.” </p><p> “Tell me quick, is there anything that</p><p>would make it hard for him to leave this </p><p>place?” </p><p> “He’s gettin’ rich here,” said Sheehy,</p><p>"and then there’s a girl. A good girl, too. </p><p>He seems to have lost his head there. But </p><p>the girl-” </p><p> “All right. That’s all.”</p><p> 0*. HAGGERTY straightened around</p><p> just as Doak saw him.</p><p>LaAJ In his turn, Doak blinked with </p><p>surprise. He faltered in his pace, and for </p><p>an instant every feature of him expressed a </p><p>sharp and unmitigated terror. Then he, too, </p><p>seemed to have a second thought, and </p><p>it was with somewhat of a gloating smile </p><p>that he altered his course and marched </p><p>straight toward Haggerty. </p><p> But Haggerty, curiously enough, looked</p><p>at him casually and then away again as </p><p>though he had never seen him before; and </p><p>when Doak stopped in front of Haggerty he </p><p>was met with a look of blank inquiry. </p><p> “Well, so it’s you,” said Doak.' It was</p><p>half a sneer and half a threat. </p><p> “What’s that?” asked Haggerty, in ap-</p><p>parent surprise. </p><p> “Oh, don’t bluff. I know you—Hag-</p><p>gerty.”</p><p> “That’s my name,” said Haggerty, won-</p><p>deringly. </p><p> “They usualLy change it,” said Doak,</p><p>nastily, “but, that bein’ the case, maybe it’s </p><p>smarter not to.” </p><p> “It’s a common name,” replied Haggerty,</p><p>with rising anger. “I tell you again, you’ve </p><p>made a mistake.” </p><p> “Oh, you can’t put that over,” rasped</p><p>Doak. “And I’ll tell you what. I ain’t no </p><p>blasted peacher, and it’s too cursed much </p><p>trouble to turn you up, but this camp ain’t </p><p>big enough for you and me. I won’t ad- </p><p>mire seein’ you around here after tonight.” </p><p>“I hope you go blind, then,” said Hag- </p><p>gerty, evenly. </p><p> “Look out for yourself, then, you-”</p><p> In the middle of his sentence, Doak’s</p><p>hand had flashed to his revolver butt. But </p><p>the weapon was never withdrawn. Sheehy </p><p>didn’t see whence he had snatched it, nor, </p><p>it is likely did Doak; but in Haggerty’s </p><p>hand had suddenly appeared a short, ugly </p><p>derringer. Its muzzle, filed smooth where </p><p>the front sight had been, was shoved against </p><p>Doak’s chest. </p><p> “That’ll be all tonight,” said Haggerty,</p><p>crisply. “Now, about face!” </p><p> Doak hesitated an instant, glaring at</p><p>Haggerty furiously. </p><p> “I’m squeezing the trigger,” warned Hag-</p><p>gerty tensely. </p><p> Involuntarily, it seemed, Doak glanced</p><p>down at the menacing hand and saw the </p><p>whitening knuckles. In a sort of hurry, </p><p>he wheeled toward the bar. </p><p> So swiftly and quietly had the incident</p><p>passed that not more than three men ob- </p><p>served it, and they made no remark. Doak </p><p>passed behind the bar. Haggerty turned </p><p>to Sheehy and found the latter regarding </p><p>him in utter bewilderment. </p><p> “Saints in heaven,” cried Sheehy, “where</p><p>did ye get that gun?” </p><p> “Sleeve draw,” explained Haggerty, pock-</p><p>eting the weapon. “It’s good for snakes. </p><p>Let’s get out of this.” </p><p> Outside, they turned toward Sheehy’s</p><p>cabin. Sheehy, according to his non- </p><p>inquisitive code, waited for Haggerty to </p><p>speak. </p><p> “You saw what happened,” began Hag-</p><p>gerty, after a moment. “I’ve got to get </p><p>that man. I’ve got to get him alive, not </p><p>dead. And from what you say, I’ll have to </p><p>smash his gang to do it. So I’m going to be </p><p>a mighty unsafe friend-” </p><p> “Another remark of that kind,” inter-</p><p>rupted Sheehy, “and ye’ll be no friend at all. </p><p>What d’ye think I am? As I explained be- </p><p>fore, I’m needin’ a partner mighty bad. </p><p>Will ye come?” </p><p> Haggerty hesitated.</p><p> “The claim next mine,” said Sheehy care-</p><p>lessly, “is worked by the girl I told ye about, </p><p>the one Doak’s courtin’.” </p><p> “By a girl,” exclaimed Haggerty.</p><p> “Sure, and her father.”</p><p> A quick, hard light leaped into Haggerty’s</p><p>eyes. </p><p>Forty-Nine </p><p>25 </p><p> “I will, Sheehy,” said he, "and thank</p><p>you kindly for the chance.” </p><p>n </p><p>SO MONDAY morning Haggerty </p><p>joined the workers in the gold-bear- </p><p>ing gulch that lay back of Grizzly; </p><p>and he was peering into the riffles of Shee- </p><p>hy’s cradle for signs of their first joint clean- </p><p>up when he heard a woman’s voice behind </p><p>him. He turned, and saw a girl helping a </p><p>feeble old man down an ill-defined trail to </p><p>the gold diggings. </p><p> They had evidently come from a teetery-</p><p>looklng tent pitched beside an ancient </p><p>prairie schooner half-way up the side of the </p><p>gulch. They reached the claim adjoining </p><p>Sheehy’s and immediately fell to work. </p><p>The girl picked up a shovel, and swung </p><p>lightly down into the miniature shaft. </p><p>Intermittent showers of black earth began </p><p>to come out of it. The old man loaded it </p><p>into a crudely constructed wheelbarrow. </p><p> When the barrow was full the girl climbed</p><p>out of the hole and wheeled it down to the </p><p>tumbling creek. The old man began plying </p><p>the bucket while she alternately shoveled </p><p>the earth into the cradle and rocked it; </p><p>always, Haggerty saw, she did the lion’s </p><p>share of the work. </p><p> “That’s Rosa Brookes?” asked Haggerty,</p><p>in a queer voice. </p><p> “Sure,” said Sheehy. “There’s none</p><p>other like her in Grizzly.” </p><p> Haggerty stared at her. Somehow he</p><p>had fitted his imagination of the girl to her </p><p>surroundings. He had pictured an Amazon </p><p>of a woman, strong, rough, semi-masculine. </p><p>This girl was strong, but there the parallel </p><p>ended. She was daintily feminine from the </p><p>top of her broad felt hat to the worn soles </p><p>of her shoes. Her face was dark and irreg- </p><p>ularly beautiful; she was like a flower, </p><p>transplanted from a hot-house somewhere </p><p>and shrinking a little. </p><p> It wasn’t like Haggerty, that imagery, yet</p><p>it was apt. For, though the girl worked </p><p>busily, smiled at her father, hummed little</p><p>tunes to herself, he could see that down deep </p><p>she was filled with uneasiness. An un- </p><p>easiness that Haggerty could well under- </p><p>stand, when he recalled what Sheehy had </p><p>told him. Quite apart from Doak’s pur- </p><p>suit of her, her late history had been enough </p><p>to weaken the courage of the bravest. </p><p> She and her father had been members of</p><p>one of the most ill-fated of the transconti- </p><p>nental parties. It had lost itself in the </p><p>Humboldt Sink, it had taken a wrong cut- </p><p>off, it had finally been compelled to Winter </p><p>in the high Sierras. More than half its </p><p>number had died there, including Rosa’s </p><p>two brothers. An honorable testimony it is </p><p>to those nineteenth-century Argonauts that </p><p>most of the women, in all those famine- </p><p>beleagured expeditions, survived. </p><p> Those who got through at last had made</p><p>straight for the lowlands as though driven </p><p>by an obsession. But Old Man Brookes </p><p>had broken down in Grizzly, and Rosa had </p><p>stayed with him perforce. Now they </p><p>wanted only to get back to the East, with </p><p>enough money to buy back the home they </p><p>had sold to make t he trip. </p><p> “I’d sure hate to see ’em start,” Sheehy</p><p>had said, “as long as Doak holds the </p><p>road.” </p><p> Haggerty studied the girl. Clear as the</p><p>sunlight was the impression he got of fine- </p><p>ness and strength and unsullied honesty. And </p><p>all of a sudden he wanted very much to win </p><p>her friendship for reasons quite apart from </p><p>his desire to trouble Doak. He wanted </p><p>more than the nodding acquaintance Sheehy </p><p>and the other miners had, and all morning </p><p>he puzzled over the problem of attaining it. </p><p> That afternoon, chance favored him.</p><p>Sheehy and he were deep-tunneling at the </p><p>time, up-stream in the direction of the </p><p>Brookes claim. Haggerty uncovered a </p><p>nugget, a pitted and scored chunk of almost </p><p>pure gold, dull-colored and heavy. They </p><p>exulted over their find, until Haggerty sug- </p><p>gested they might have tunneled too far. </p><p>Exact measurements proved he was right. </p><p>By his statement of where he had found it, </p><p>the nugget belonged to the Brookeses. </p><p> So he explained the matter and gave it to</p><p>them. It was a small thing in a way, but it</p><p>was the beginning of trust, and that is never </p><p>a small thing. Haggerty felt somewhat </p><p>sheepish under the appreciative light of </p><p>Rosa Brookes’ eyes, and under the old man’s </p><p>thanks, and even when he accepted what he </p><p>had played for, an invitation to call some- </p><p>time at their tent. But he wouldn’t have </p><p>undone what he had done. </p><p> That night Haggerty turned over to</p><p>Sheehy a hundred dollars in dust. It was </p><p>half the approximate value of the nugget. </p><p> “I’m afraid I lied a bit,” said Haggerty.</p><p>“It really came out of our dirt. I tunneled </p><p>a little further after I found it, that’s all.” </p><p> Sheehy didn’t look as astonished as he</p><p>26 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>might. He chuckled a little, and then fell </p><p>into a thoughtful silence. </p><p> “I wonder if you’re playin’ quite fair,</p><p>lad,” he hazarded at length. </p><p> Haggerty stared at him.</p><p> “What do you mean?”</p><p> “Well,” said Sheehy slowly, “I’ll tell ye.</p><p>Doak knows the girl thinks nothin’ of him, </p><p>for he’s forced himself on her through fear; </p><p>but after the manner of his kind he’s in love </p><p>with her. Ye’ve seen a flame lick up the </p><p>side of a house, devourin’ while it caresses— </p><p>well, that’s the way of his love. Also he </p><p>hates ye. Also the two of ye have an ac- </p><p>count to be settled betwixt ye. Consider </p><p>them things, and the undisciplined bundle </p><p>of evil passions that ye know Doak to be, </p><p>and then ask yourself if you’re the safest </p><p>friend in the world for the girl to have.” </p><p> But Haggerty had already considered</p><p>them, and to a different conclusion than </p><p>Sheehy’s. He was very young, and he had </p><p>the confidence of youth, and youth’s ability </p><p>to believe what he wanted to. - If Rosa </p><p>Brookes were in danger, then so much more </p><p>did she need him as a friend. </p><p> Also, as Sheehy may have suspected, he</p><p>had another motive. </p><p> He underestimated Doak, both his</p><p>strength and his weakness, else he would </p><p>not have reasoned as he did: if Doak were </p><p>made jealous, well and good, the more </p><p>tightly would he be held in Grizzly, and the </p><p>more time would Haggerty have to work </p><p>out the destruction of Doak’s power in </p><p>Grizzly, the seizure of Doak, and his own </p><p>vindication. </p><p> Haggerty’s mind went a long trail back-</p><p>ward that night, and at the end of that trail </p><p>there lay a dead man and a cell with a </p><p>broken lock. </p><p>Ill </p><p>“I’VE DONE what you asked me </p><p>to,” said Rosa Brookes. “I don’t </p><p>see him any more. But I’m—I’m</p><p>afraid. I try not to be, it seems silly. But </p><p>he’s—drinking lately. And I’m afraid of </p><p>him.” </p><p> “You musn’t be,” worried Haggerty.</p><p>“It’ll be all right. In a week more-” </p><p> It was Sunday, and they were sitting on</p><p>a little knoll covered with swaying wild </p><p>oats, quite out of sight or hearing of the </p><p>camp. </p><p> “There’s so much I don’t understand,”</p><p>puzzled the girl. “About you and—him. </p><p>They say the first night you came here you </p><p>had trouble with him. And you’ve been </p><p>working against him ever since, trying to </p><p>organize the miners against him. Of course, </p><p>that’s good, if he’s what you say. But—” </p><p>and she hesitated, “but he’s been saying </p><p>terrible things about you, too. To me, and </p><p>everybody.” </p><p> “What did he say?” asked Haggerty, his</p><p>voice hardening. </p><p> “He said,” replied Rosa in a low tone and</p><p>with an effort, “that if I knew everything </p><p>about you, I’d never look at you again. </p><p>That you are worse than even he is. </p><p>And he said in a few days more he’d </p><p>be able to prove it, and he would.” </p><p> For a minute Haggerty stared out over</p><p>the flower-strewn hills, an uneasy look on </p><p>his face. Then he turned to Rosa and asked </p><p>softly— </p><p> “Supposing he did—supposing he seemed</p><p>able to prove it, would you believe him?” </p><p> “Oh, I don’t know,” doubted Rosa.</p><p>She sat twisting her hands perplexedly. </p><p>“Everything out here is so different. The </p><p>men are different. Even you. You did </p><p>shoot a man. Yesterday. I heard about </p><p>it.” </p><p> The thing had been torturing her all day.</p><p> “He tried to shoot me” said Haggerty</p><p>briefly. “I could have killed him. I </p><p>didn’t.” </p><p> “Oh, I’m glad of that,” said Rosa tensely.</p><p> “It was the way I knew you’d feel about</p><p>it that saved him,” said Haggerty. “He </p><p>was worse than a rattler.” </p><p> Indeed, the man had drawn on him</p><p>without word or warning. Haggerty’s </p><p>lightning quickness only had saved him. </p><p>The would-be assassin, who was one of the </p><p>Golden Bear’s most sinister habitues, had </p><p>evidently relied on Doak’s power to shield </p><p>him from the result of his crime. It was </p><p>the second attempt on Haggerty’s life in </p><p>two weeks. The other time he had been </p><p>shot at from behind in the dark, and the </p><p>bullet had gone through his hat. </p><p> Haggerty turned the talk to other topics,</p><p>delighting to see Rosa’s eyes and face light </p><p>up after a while, as she forgot herself and </p><p>Doak and Grizzly, and fell under the in- </p><p>fluence of the perfect day and the windr </p><p>swept hills. They found much to talk </p><p>about, those two; but most of the way back </p><p>they walked in that close silence that some- </p><p>times falls between those that draw nearer </p><p>than friendship. </p><p>Forty-Nine </p><p>27 </p><p> After they had parted, however, Hag-</p><p>gerty’s mind reverted to Doak’s threat. </p><p> He had thought that if Doak were to de-</p><p>nounce him, he would have done it when </p><p>Haggerty first appeared in Grizzly. The </p><p>fact that he hadn’t seemed to prove his </p><p>fear, and the correctness of Haggerty’s sur- </p><p>mise. His threat at this late day meant </p><p>something. Haggerty wondered what </p><p>whimsy of fate might have put in Doak’s </p><p>hands the seeming proof he had mentioned. </p><p>And he wondered whether Doak, in sheer </p><p>desperation born of jealousy and hatred and </p><p>fear, would find the courage to use it. </p><p> But in the morning Haggerty put aside</p><p>his doubts and got busy again. </p><p> His work was double those days. He was</p><p>both miner and missionary. In the eyes of </p><p>those of Grizzly’s citizens who profited by </p><p>the presence of Doak’s men, he was a des- </p><p>picable malcontent. To most of the </p><p>miners he had been from the first a man of </p><p>mysterious motives, who was dooming </p><p>himself to death in a worthy but hopeless </p><p>cause. The second man he preached his </p><p>gospel of law-and-order to warned him: </p><p>“There was one man started to buck </p><p>Doak already. We buried him quiet. </p><p>The verdict was extreme shortness of </p><p>breath, brought on by lead-poisonin’.” </p><p> But Haggerty managed to live. He lived</p><p>and talked and made friends, and for a while </p><p>that was about all. </p><p> He heard peculiar arguments. Where</p><p>there was no law there could be no crime, </p><p>anyway. Every man his own policeman, </p><p>that was good enough. Grizzly was only </p><p>a temporary camping-place; why should </p><p>they trouble themselves? They hadn’t </p><p>time to bother, their corns hadn’t been </p><p>trampled on much, let the rest of the coun- </p><p>try take care of itself. </p><p> But gradually he began to get the decent</p><p>element of the camp together. He began </p><p>to rouse in them resentment at the domi- </p><p>nance of the outlaws. He urged that </p><p>sooner or later the clash would come, as it </p><p>had come in other camps and in the larger </p><p>cities. And backing him in all this was the</p><p>instinct for order and self-government that </p><p>shows itself wherever Anglo-Saxons gather. </p><p> Numerically the honest men in Grizzly</p><p>were greatly in the superiority. But they </p><p>were very busy, they were making money, </p><p>and before Haggerty’s advent they had a </p><p>strong tendency toward letting well enough </p><p>alone. Also they had a normal regard for </p><p>their own lives, and they foresaw that an </p><p>open clash with Doak’s men meant blood- </p><p>shed. And nothing short of actual destruc- </p><p>tion of the gang would serve. </p><p> If they but drove the desperadoes out to</p><p>that secret rendezvous of which they </p><p>boasted so often, then life in Grizzly would </p><p>be a desperate adventure indeed. </p><p> But as it was, there was ceaseless irrita-</p><p>tion. The very presence of the undesir- </p><p>ables was like a challenge. Their mysteri- </p><p>ous disappearances and returns, followed </p><p>always by the story of some back-country </p><p>outrage, kept the camp filled with a certain </p><p>sense of indignity. And they were bold blus- </p><p>terers for the most part, with a touch of the </p><p>bully about them, whose loud words goaded </p><p>to anger far more men than they cowed. </p><p> All this helped Haggerty. He was care-</p><p>ful in choosing his leaders. He got as the </p><p>nucleus of his Vigilante organization the </p><p>soldier men in camp, the two storekeepers, </p><p>a doctor, a square gambler, half a dozen </p><p>middle-aged miners. They were already </p><p>impatient with conditions, and were not </p><p>hard to enlist. The rest followed slowly. </p><p>But as the days went by, cohesion set in. </p><p>Haggerty was confident that, given time, he </p><p>would have the respectable element of the </p><p>camp with him to a man. </p><p> And now he began to reveal the reward he</p><p>would ask for, Doak taken alive and de- </p><p>livered into his hands. </p><p> The trouble was, all this could not be</p><p>hidden from the crooks. Their surface re- </p><p>action to the threat was defiance and an </p><p>increasing arrogance. But underneath they </p><p>were growing uneasy. They knew the </p><p>strength that could be massed against them </p><p>once it had coalesced. Haggerty heard </p><p>that the clearer-headed among them were </p><p>urging Doak to retire from the town. His </p><p>great fear was that they would have their</p><p>way before he got ready to strike. </p><p> And what of Doak all this time?</p><p>IV </p><p>IT WAS very beautiful that night. </p><p>Through trees motionless as senti- </p><p>nels the starlight trickled, close and </p><p>friendly. The giant ridges were things of </p><p>loveliness, so softly silhouetted were they </p><p>against the dusky sky. In the bottom of </p><p>the gulch the tumbling brook made music </p><p>ancient as the world. And Rosa and Hag- </p><p>gerty, sitting alone by the dying embers of a </p><p>28 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>camp-fire, made believe to forget that there </p><p>was anything else in the world than the </p><p>visible harmony that surrounded them, em- </p><p>braced them, and drew their souls together </p><p>in a spell as simple and clean and sweet as </p><p>itself. </p><p> Rosa’s father had gone to bed, and the</p><p>two had been alone perhaps an hour, when </p><p>from somewhere above them, from beyond </p><p>the wall of rocks that half encircled the tent </p><p>and made Haggerty’s position compara- </p><p>tively safe, came the sound of breaking </p><p>shrubbery. </p><p> Instantly Rosa was on her feet, with the</p><p>fear of Doak on her, and was urging Hag- </p><p>gerty out of the circle of light and behind </p><p>the tent. </p><p> Haggerty obeyed, though the visitor</p><p>seemed to be making too much noise to be </p><p>dangerous, and so they stood there until </p><p>Doak rounded the tent and came up to the </p><p>camp-fire. </p><p> The hell of evil passions in which he had</p><p>presumably writhed the last few weeks had </p><p>changed him greatly. He was unshaven </p><p>and shaken and nervous, and he glared sus- </p><p>piciously around in the shadows. When </p><p>Haggerty, followed by Rosa, stepped for- </p><p>ward, his body tensed galvanically, and he </p><p>emitted an inarticulate growl. </p><p> “Well?” from Haggerty.</p><p> “Thought I’d find you here,” with an</p><p>attempt at a sneer. </p><p> “What do you want?” inquired Haggerty</p><p>shortly.	t</p><p> “I want to talk with you. And with</p><p>Rosa, too. I’ve got something here it’ll </p><p>do you both good to hear about.” </p><p> A note of malevolent triumph was in his</p><p>voice; but it was strange how the fear that </p><p>had never been absent from him since Hag- </p><p>gerty’s arrival in Grizzly broke through that </p><p>triumph even then, and tempered it with </p><p>doubt. </p><p> “Well, come to the point,” snapped</p><p>Haggerty. </p><p> “I’ll come to it quick enough,” declared</p><p>Doak. </p><p> His hand went inside his coat. It came</p><p>out with nothing more ominous than a </p><p>newspaper, crumpled, dog-eared, and brown </p><p>with age. But Haggerty drew a sharp breath. </p><p> “I sent a man to San Francisco for this,”</p><p>said Doak. “What d’you suppose is in it?” </p><p> Haggerty, before whom the past had risen</p><p>like a specter, gripped himself, collected his </p><p>wits, and replied coolly: </p><p> “Why, I suppose, judging from its ap-</p><p>parent age and your manner, that it’s an </p><p>account of the murder of my uncle. It </p><p>probably has my description in it, too, as the </p><p>supposed murderer, and mentions the fact </p><p>that I broke jail, and that there’s a thousand </p><p>dollars reward for my arrest.” </p><p> Rosa’s cry at this abrupt confession was</p><p>the piteous one of a woman who feels her </p><p>world tottering to its foundation. But </p><p>Doak replied with a jeering chuckle: </p><p> “Wonder if you’ll admit it all as easy</p><p>when the boys get hold of you? D’you </p><p>know what I’m goin’ to do with this?” </p><p> “Why, you’re going to tear it up,” said</p><p>Haggerty easily. </p><p> “Oh, am I?” grated Doak. “Just am I?</p><p>I tell you what, I’m givin’ you just one </p><p>more chance for life. If you’re out of this </p><p>camp by sunrise, all right. If you ain’t, I’ll </p><p>publish this to the camp, and that’ll fix </p><p>you with your—respectable support, all </p><p>right. Then I’ll get the boys together and </p><p>string you up for the cowardly murderer </p><p>you are.” </p><p> Haggerty, his eyes never leaving Doak,</p><p>stepped forward and kicked some dry </p><p>twigs into the middle of the fire. </p><p> “A nice program,” he said thoughtfully.</p><p>“This world’s a strange place. Seems like </p><p>we never can get away, doesn’t it? Did you </p><p>ever'hear of the law of compensation, </p><p>Doak?” </p><p> Doak said something under his breath.</p><p> “Yes,” went on Haggerty slowly, “it</p><p>was a cowardly, cold-blooded crime. For </p><p>money; there couldn’t have been any other </p><p>motive, and they found part of his money on </p><p>me. He and I had quarreled, too, and they </p><p>proved that. I was a boy then—seems </p><p>more than a year ago, doesn’t it?—and </p><p>pretty impulsive. But he’d taken care of </p><p>me all my life. Working late at night, </p><p>shoeing a neighbor’s horse—a country </p><p>cross-roads blacksmith my uncle was, and a </p><p>farmer, too—and you can see how the mur- </p><p>derer came up from behind and struck him </p><p>down. But there was a struggle. </p><p> “Do you know, Doak, I’ve a curious</p><p>theory about crime. I believe the crimi- </p><p>nal’s always branded, some way. You </p><p>can’t get away from it, it leaves its mark. </p><p>Now this particular crime—but we won’t </p><p>talk any more about it. Do as you like. </p><p>Only it would be strange if I were hung in </p><p>Grizzly. I was sure I’d found a sign of good </p><p>luck here.” </p><p>Forty-Nine </p><p>29 </p><p> A peculiar effect these latter rambling</p><p>words had on Doak. His figure wavered in </p><p>the dancing firelight, and the paper in his </p><p>hand stirred and rustled as though it, too, </p><p>were possessed of quivering nerves. </p><p> “What d’you mean by that?” he snarled</p><p>viciously. </p><p> “Why, what do you think I mean?”</p><p>asked Haggerty lightly. “We all have our </p><p>superstitions, haven’t we? Now,” in a </p><p>voice turned deadly, “you’ve told your </p><p>story. We want no more of you. Go and </p><p>tell it to the camp, if you dare.” </p><p> “By-, I will,” cried Doak.</p><p> “If I were afraid of you,” said Haggerty,</p><p>evenly, “wouldn’t I shoot you where you </p><p>stand? Now go!” </p><p> Doak’s shoulders came forward in a</p><p>crouch. But he turned away. The menac- </p><p>ing crouch and the cautious retreat were one </p><p>and the same movement. Haggerty drew </p><p>Rosa swiftly into the shadow of the tent. </p><p>With his hand on his gun, he watched Doak </p><p>until he disappeared. Then he turned to </p><p>Rosa. </p><p> “It’s all true,” he said swiftly, “what was</p><p>in the paper. I’m wanted—hunted—now </p><p>—this minute. The other day, on the hill, I </p><p>asked you a question. I’m asking it </p><p>again.” </p><p> “Oh, what—what was it—Jack?”</p><p> “Do you believe-”</p><p> “No, no! You couldn’t. I didn’t think</p><p>—no!” She clung to his arm. </p><p> “Then God is good,” cried Haggerty,</p><p>filled with a double joy. “For Doak’s the </p><p>man. I was sure of it, and now-” </p><p> He was blinded by a crashing blow. He</p><p>didn’t hear the report of the gun. He felt </p><p>himself slipping down, felt Rosa’s arms </p><p>around him. He struggled for sight, for </p><p>strength. He knew he called out Doak’s </p><p>name. He did hear the clatter of a horse’s </p><p>hoofs and the second explosion of the revol-</p><p>ver. He felt Rosa dragged away from him. </p><p>And then he fell into a great depth wherein </p><p>was nothing but shadows. </p><p> He struggled up out of that depth. It</p><p>took a long time and a great effort, and a </p><p>sense of necessity that was more terrible </p><p>than hell-fire urged him. He found himself </p><p>swaying unsteadily on his feet. There were </p><p>men holding him. There were more </p><p>around, a great crowd of them. He heard </p><p>one say: </p><p> “Skull’s creased, that’s all. Lucky</p><p>devil.” </p><p> “Rosa, Rosa!” cried Haggerty, in a ter-</p><p>rible voice. </p><p> A silence came over that crowd that was</p><p>like the silence of the utterly damned. </p><p> Then some one spoke from the open flap</p><p>of the tent—“Old Man Brooke has cashed </p><p>in all right.” </p><p> “God!” groaned some one after an inter-</p><p>val, “can’t we do anything?” </p><p> “How can we,” came the answer, “with</p><p>our horses druv away?” </p><p> “And with Doak and his whole devil’s</p><p>brood gone. If there was one left, one, </p><p>we’d find a way to the rest.” </p><p> “It was Doak done this, most likely. He</p><p>had the rest waitin’ by the corral. I heard </p><p>’em riding off like mad right away after I </p><p>heard the shots. It was so we couldn’t </p><p>follow they took the horses.” </p><p> “Listen!”</p><p> A gust of wind had driven down the canon</p><p>from the east, and upon it rode like a chal- </p><p>lenge the retreating sound of a galloping </p><p>horse. </p><p> “Let me go,” cried Haggerty, suddenly.</p><p>“Lad, you’re hurled,” came Sheehy’s </p><p>voice. </p><p> But strength was flowing back upon Hag-</p><p>gerty like a tide, and, flinging off the friendly </p><p>hands that would have held him, he started </p><p>on a run up the side of the gulch in the wake </p><p>of the double-burdened horse.</p><p> There were others close behind him when</p><p>he hit the trail, but they did not last. </p><p>V </p><p>Up] EXHAUSTION! The triple tor- </p><p>||!iy| ment of bursting heart, of straining </p><p>lungs, of flagging muscles. A brain </p><p>weary, too, from its constant insistence </p><p>upon the single idea of just one effort more, </p><p>and another, and another. The passage </p><p>from this into a state of sheer physical </p><p>deadness, in which the body becomes an </p><p>incumbrance, worse than useless flesh that </p><p>must be lifted and lifted and driven forward </p><p>by an overweening will. And then that </p><p>very will dies into a torturing sense of in- </p><p>evitability, past and future are alike wiped </p><p>out, and there is nothing else in the world </p><p>but a grim eternity of endless effort, con- </p><p>sciousness absorbed in pain, a madness, an </p><p>obsession, an agony. </p><p> Such were the stages through which Hag-</p><p>gerty passed in his pursuit of Doak, but </p><p>when that last stage came it was not </p><p>30 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>punishment, but a very great relief. For </p><p>there are mental agonies that pass the physi- </p><p>cal, and in the moment of his discovery of </p><p>Rosa’s abduction, Haggerty had thought to </p><p>go mad. Black dogs of nameless horror </p><p>threatened the citadel of his mind, and re- </p><p>morse flayed his soul like a scorpion- </p><p>tipped whip. </p><p> Remorse, for was he not himself to blame?</p><p>Had he not, in sickening truth, played Rosa as </p><p>a pawn, played her attractions to hold Doak </p><p>in Grizzly? Now nothing mattered but </p><p>Rosa’s safety, but like a whisper from a </p><p>barbed tongue was the thought, “Too late, </p><p>too late!” until that horrible numbness </p><p>came like a blessing. </p><p> He had started from the camp of catas-</p><p>trophe shortly after midnight. At first his </p><p>reason held him down to the easy, falling </p><p>stride of the distance runner. Very shortly </p><p>this stride became a necessity. </p><p> There were three tilings that gave him</p><p>hope, the horse was double-loaded, for Doak </p><p>had evidently no desire to explain to his </p><p>followers his use for a second mount, the </p><p>trail was worn wide and plain by the immi- </p><p>grant wagons, and he was trained down to </p><p>the finest point. By lucky chance he was </p><p>wearing riding-breeches and light shoes. </p><p>He threw off coat and upper shirt, and </p><p>threw away half of his cartridges. He would </p><p>have thrown away the gold dust in his hip </p><p>pocket, but he forgot it. </p><p> Very little light came through the trees</p><p>that overhung his path. Haggerty stum- </p><p>bled often and sometimes fell headlong. </p><p>But he was always up again and going, and </p><p>he never quite lost the sound of the hoof- </p><p>beats ahead. </p><p> Once Doak pulled his horse down to a</p><p>walk. Then Haggerty’s dimming con- </p><p>sciousness was shot through with the deli- </p><p>rium of hope. Surely he could overtake </p><p>him now. A Berserker rage came to Hag- </p><p>gerty, and he felt his hands on his enemy’s </p><p>throat. Then Doak, his horse rested, was </p><p>off again on a gallop. This happened again </p><p>and again, and each time was a torment. </p><p> Haggerty never halted, never consciously</p><p>slackened his pace. He knew if he did he </p><p>would never get started again. But deeper </p><p>rooted still was the knowledge that as he </p><p>was running he would continue to run until </p><p>he caught Doak, or lost him hopelessly, or </p><p>died of a broken heart. </p><p> He ran on for hours, for days, for endless</p><p>years, it seemed. After a while the only </p><p>sense impression he had was that of the </p><p>sound he followed. The stars began to </p><p>pale, the eastern sky grew purple. The </p><p>early Summer dawn came rushing over the </p><p>hills to meet him, and he did not know it. </p><p> It was broad daylight, and he had not</p><p>realized it. He wondered what made him </p><p>realize it now. Then he knew, for the </p><p>crooked trail had turned straight, and plain </p><p>in view perhaps half a mile ahead was a </p><p>horse with two riders. </p><p> Haggerty tried to run faster, but his</p><p>legs would not respond. A desperate </p><p>anger came over him. It was an anger </p><p>directed against his body, a faulty mechan- </p><p>ism that failed him in stress. </p><p> But he kept on in the same jogging trot.</p><p>His breathing racked him from the dia- </p><p>phragm upward; the sound of it was like a </p><p>sobbing. Blood had matted on his face, </p><p>and, where it was not, the skin showed pur- </p><p>ple with the unoxygenized life fluid. Above </p><p>his hips his muscles were loose, lax, so his </p><p>trunk was held insecurely to its pivot, and </p><p>swayed as he ran. </p><p> A little later, his quarry disappeared</p><p>down a declivity. When Haggerty got to </p><p>the edge of the canon into which the trail </p><p>descended, Doak was nowhere in sight. </p><p>And yet Haggerty could see a long way </p><p>ahead. </p><p> Puzzled, he descended to the canon’s bot-</p><p>tom, and then he understood. To the </p><p>right the canon was blocked with a land- </p><p>slide, but to the left it was open, with a </p><p>flooring of broken rocks. And he stood </p><p>considering what to do. </p><p> His changed posture made Haggerty</p><p>aware of the bulge on his hip. He took out </p><p>the sack of dust and dumped half its con- </p><p>tents on a rock in the middle of the trail. </p><p>Then with his teeth he worried a hole in the</p><p>sack so the rest would sift out slowly. </p><p>Holding it in his hand, he turned into the </p><p>canon. For quite a distance the way he </p><p>took was marked with yellow dust. </p><p> His pace was a shamble. The way was</p><p>hazardous with holes and abrupt descents. </p><p>Haggerty fell often. He did not always </p><p>rise again immediately. But when he fell it </p><p>was forward, and when he was down he </p><p>made way on hands and knees. </p><p> He followed no tracks, but on that hard</p><p>bottom there could have been no tracks to </p><p>follow. </p><p> After a while, as through a thick, red</p><p>mist, he saw Doak again. Doak was an </p><p>Forty-Nine </p><p>31 </p><p>unthinkable distance ahead. He was pick- </p><p>ing his way on foot, leading the horse, in the </p><p>saddle of which still sat the woman. </p><p> And again Doak disappeared. He disap-</p><p>peared mysteriously. With a snarl at his </p><p>failing senses, Haggerty brushed the sweat </p><p>from his eyes and stared again. Where </p><p>Doak had been there was a patch of under- </p><p>brush. Haggerty reached that underbrush, </p><p>and stopped. </p><p> He dropped flat to the ground, and wrig-</p><p>gled into the bushes. Looking all ways, he </p><p>came to where he thought the wall of the </p><p>canon should have been, and there was no </p><p>wall there. </p><p> There was vacancy there. A hole, it</p><p>seemed, opening straight into the face of the </p><p>cliff. A tunnel higher than a man, and </p><p>broader, from which came a grumbling </p><p>voice: </p><p> “What the devil’s that? Good Lord, a</p><p>woman!” </p><p> “Lend a hand here. Take the nag,”</p><p>replied Doak surlily. </p><p> “There ain’t no one watchin’ here but</p><p>me,” objected the voice. </p><p> “Never mind. I got away clean. There’s</p><p>no danger.” </p><p> Hoof-beats and footsteps receded into the</p><p>earth. Haggerty gathered his strength and </p><p>followed. His legs had become incum- </p><p>brances. He dragged himself with his </p><p>hands and writhed along. </p><p> A square of light appeared ahead of him.</p><p>Outlined against it were four figures. One </p><p>man had hold of a woman’s arm. The other </p><p>led the horse. Suddenly all four passed be- </p><p>yond that square of light and melted into a </p><p>confusion of moving forms. </p><p> Haggerty struggled on to the end of the</p><p>passage. With his body twisted behind a </p><p>projecting rock, he stole a look into the </p><p>rock-bound chamber. </p><p> Just within the entrance stood Doak, with</p><p>his hand on Rosa’s arm. Fronting them at </p><p>various distances were perhaps twenty-five </p><p>men, most of whom Haggerty had seen in </p><p>Grizzly. Against the opposite wall of the </p><p>rendezvous were tethered the horses. There </p><p>were many cases of goods and ammunition </p><p>boxes there, too. The whole place was </p><p>dimly lighted with two oil-lamps, brack- </p><p>eted near the entrance. </p><p> “Lord, Doak, this ain’t no place for a</p><p>woman,” Haggerty heard one man say. </p><p> “That’s all right,” replied Doak sharply.</p><p>“Simpson you go guard the tunnel.” </p><p> And Doak began to lead Rosa across the</p><p>front of the crowd, to the right. </p><p> Haggerty saw he was making for a narrow</p><p>opening in the wall, beyond which looked to </p><p>be another and smaller chamber. Rosa </p><p>saw it, too, for she cried out and began to </p><p>struggle. Protesting growls mingled with </p><p>the brutal laughs of the men, but none </p><p>stirred to help her. And then Haggerty had </p><p>never felt stronger in his life, and he pulled </p><p>his gun and fired. </p><p> As he fired, he leaped. He was on Doak</p><p>before Doak struck the floor. Blood </p><p>smeared Haggerty’s hand as he gripped </p><p>Doak by the right shoulder and dragged him </p><p>toward the breach in the wall, leading into </p><p>the inner chamber. Doak’s revolver, in- </p><p>stantly drawn, clattered against the floor. </p><p>Rosa snatched it up. Haggerty shoved her </p><p>violently ahead of him. A bullet whistled </p><p>past Haggerty’s head as he followed Rosa </p><p>through the opening. The next instant he </p><p>had jerked Doak inside the second chamber </p><p>and whirled around, his revolver swaying </p><p>level like a serpent’s head, searching for a </p><p>target. </p><p>VI </p><p>HE HAD acted without plan, </p><p>wholly on impulse, and it was with </p><p>astonishment that he realized there </p><p>was no target there, and that for the mo- </p><p>ment at least he held the outlaws at an im- </p><p>passe. His range of vision commanded the </p><p>outer end and exit of the chamber; when he </p><p>had made his rush the outlaws had been </p><p>back of this space, and they stayed there, </p><p>fulminating threats and curses. The net </p><p>situation was that if they held him prisoner,</p><p>prisoners he also held them. </p><p> Also he held another advantage. His</p><p>first words, cutting sharply into their </p><p>jumble of voices, reminded them of this: </p><p>“Rosa, the first shot that’s fired in here, </p><p>kill Doak. You out there, you know me. </p><p>Keep back.” </p><p> Their talk died away at this, and then</p><p>one voice replied bullyingly— </p><p> “-, young fellow, you can’t bluff us</p><p>all.” </p><p> “I can kill half a dozen of you, though,”</p><p>replied Haggerty with apparent conviction. </p><p>He thanked God they did not know how he </p><p>was trembling from head to foot with ex- </p><p>haustion. </p><p> “We’ll get you in the end, though.”</p><p> Haggerty did not reply. The fact was</p><p>32 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>incontestable. One man could not stand </p><p>forever against twenty-five. Nor could the </p><p>outlaws afford to let either him or Rosa </p><p>escape with the secret of their personnel and </p><p>hiding-place. The situation was as hope- </p><p>less as could be imagined. </p><p> “Say, young fellow, let’s call it quits,y</p><p>came the offer. “You let Doak go, and </p><p>we’ll let you go. We’ll let you leave here </p><p>safe. That’s a promise.” </p><p> “And the girl?” asked Haggerty.</p><p> “Sure,” replied the man, readily.</p><p> “How do we know you’ll let us go?”</p><p> “Ain’t our word good?”</p><p> Haggerty laughed shortly.</p><p> “You’ll have to do better than that.”</p><p> “All right, then,” replied the bargainer,</p><p>angrily. “We can do that, too.” </p><p> “What about Doak?” Haggerty replied to</p><p>the threat. </p><p> “Well,” said the man deliberately, “Doak</p><p>was-fool enough to get us into this.” </p><p> And then Haggerty knew that his best</p><p>card had failed him. He could imagine </p><p>that Doak’s power over his men had re- </p><p>cently been slipping. Fear is Very ruinous </p><p>to leadership, and Doak of late had been </p><p>very much afraid. </p><p> He was afraid now. Amid a stream of</p><p>curses at his men, at Haggerty, at every- </p><p>thing, he demanded if Haggerty meant to </p><p>let him bleed to death. </p><p> Haggerty passed back a knife and hand-</p><p>kerchief, and Rosa set to work to bandage </p><p>his wound as best she might. </p><p> Haggerty never stirred from his post.</p><p>The rest was doing him good; he was stead- </p><p>ier now. He wondered how the outlaws </p><p>would go about it to accomplish their </p><p>threat. </p><p> He wasn’t left long in doubt. A brisk</p><p>hammering began without, the splintering </p><p>of wood, and the creaking of nails wrenched </p><p>from their sockets. Haggerty remembered </p><p>the packing-cases and ammunition boxes, </p><p>and he knew they were being shaped into </p><p>a movable barricade. He wondered whether </p><p>at the last moment he had not better turn </p><p>Rosa over to the desperadoes, trusting what </p><p>remnants of white manhood there might be </p><p>in them. He decided not. </p><p> He was roused from a spell of black and</p><p>remorseful brooding by Rosa’s excited voice. </p><p> “Why,” she cried, “there’s a scar here.</p><p>On his shoulder!” </p><p> “There is?” said Haggerty, almost indif-</p><p>ferently. </p><p> “A scar, a burn, the shape of—of a horse-</p><p>shoe!” </p><p> Her voice was full of significance and a</p><p>question. </p><p> “Yes,” said Haggerty, “you’ve guessed</p><p>it. The same mark was on my uncle’s </p><p>body in half a dozen places. The bum of a </p><p>horseshoe white hot from the forge. It fell </p><p>to the floor, and they struggled over it, and I </p><p>figured his murderer couldn’t escape. And </p><p>I was sure it was Doak. Doak had been </p><p>working for him; he’d quit and gone two </p><p>days before, but that was a trick. I knew </p><p>he wanted to get to the gold fields, and </p><p>hadn’t the money.” </p><p> “Why, that explains-”</p><p> “Everything,” said Haggerty, dully.</p><p>“My talk of brands, and why Doak was </p><p>afraid to accuse me, and—why you’re here. </p><p>I drove him mad, Rosa, with fear and jeal- </p><p>ousy and hate, and I never thought of you. </p><p>I deserve to die—but you-” </p><p> “Hush!” said Rosa. “You saved me</p><p>from—you are dying for me. There’s no </p><p>chance, is there, Jack?” </p><p> He was silent. He could not bring him-</p><p>self to tell her there was none, yet how </p><p>could he bid her hope? </p><p> “-you,” said Doak weakly, “you’ll</p><p>both die with me like rats!” </p><p> And then, minute by minute, a long time</p><p>dragged away. It might have been an </p><p>hour. The sound of the preparations for </p><p>attack went on unceasingly. To Haggerty </p><p>the suspense became almost unendurable. </p><p>If he had been alone he would have leaped </p><p>out and ended it all in one quick flurry of </p><p>fight. </p><p> Once from Rosa a curious question, con-</p><p>sidering what was impending. </p><p> “Jack, why did you—run away?”</p><p> “I was a young fool,” said Haggerty. “I</p><p>was afraid. I thought they’d convict me. </p><p>I had part of his money, you know, and </p><p>we’d quarreled—that was the reason I had </p><p>his money, he’d given it to me, and I was </p><p>going away.” </p><p> “You wouldn’t do it now,” said Rosa.</p><p>“No,” said Haggerty, “I wouldn’t do it </p><p>now.” </p><p> Man-like, he wondered at her woman’s</p><p>sigh of relief. It was the one blot she knew </p><p>of on his shield. </p><p> Close upon that came their warning of</p><p>imminent doom, the scraping upon the </p><p>rocks of the wooden barricade. Its further </p><p>end came into view. How thick it was </p><p>Forty-Nine </p><p>33 </p><p>Haggerty could not tell, nor how it was held </p><p>upright; but it was loop-holed at conveni- </p><p>ent intervals, and it was high enough so that </p><p>Haggerty could catch no glimpse of the </p><p>crouching bodies that pushed it forward. </p><p> Haggerty felt a light touch on his shoul-</p><p>der. </p><p> “Jack, you may—kiss me—now.”</p><p> A moment later the muzzle of a gun ap-</p><p>peared in one of the loop-holes. Haggerty </p><p>fired, and by luck and good marksmanship, </p><p>managed to drive his bullet through the </p><p>opening. </p><p> The curses of the wounded outlaw were</p><p>checked by the harsh voice of his leader. </p><p> “Serves you right. Mind what I said,</p><p>the rest of you. Not a shot until we can </p><p>give him a volley.” </p><p> Thereafter the barricade came on stead-</p><p>ily, and with motive power as invisible as </p><p>though the planks themselves had been </p><p>granted life. It swung out as a gate is </p><p>turned, the end nearer Haggerty’s refuge al- </p><p>most immovable, the further end sweeping </p><p>clear across the cave. It was a terrible </p><p>thing to see it coming and not to be able to </p><p>check it, and to anticipate the storm of </p><p>bullets that would burst from it the moment </p><p>it got into position. It was a more terrible </p><p>thing to imagine Rosa’s body riddled hor- </p><p>ribly and lying limp and bloody. . . . </p><p> “We don’t want to kill the girl,” came the</p><p>offer. “If she’ll come out, we won’t.” </p><p>Haggerty hesitated, but Rosa cried out, </p><p>“No, no!” and there was an end of that. ■ </p><p>Doak was alternately cursing and praying </p><p>in maudlin fashion; Haggerty was bathed in </p><p>cold sweat, and he found himself longing for </p><p>the end of everything. </p><p> Inch by inch, foot by foot, the barricade</p><p>advanced. Now it cut across Haggerty’s </p><p>field of view, and crept past the mouth of </p><p>the tunnel. And now in the dark mouth of </p><p>the tunnel Haggerty saw a shadowy moving </p><p>shape. </p><p> He saw several, and one stepped tenta-</p><p>tively within the cave, back of the outlaws, </p><p>and with a wave of the arm summoned the </p><p>others. And instantly Haggerty called out </p><p>with a careful simulation of broken nerve: </p><p>“Say, there, you! There’s no use of this. </p><p>We’ll come out.” </p><p> “No use of that, now. We’ve got you.”</p><p>“I’ll get some of you, though. You know </p><p>that.” </p><p> “We’ve figured it different. We’re willin’</p><p>to take the chance.” </p><p>3 </p><p> “But the girl and Doak! You don’t</p><p>want to kill them, too. I tell you, we’ll </p><p>all come out.” </p><p> “Well, what d’ye say, boys? Saves am-</p><p>munition. All right, they say, come out, </p><p>then.” </p><p> “Rosa, are you ready?”</p><p> “Just a minute,” she took her cue from</p><p>the thin line of hard-visaged men that were </p><p>filing with Indian stealth through the en- </p><p>trance of the rendezvous. </p><p> “Make yourself beautiful, miss,” jeered</p><p>the outlaw. “But we ain’t waiting no </p><p>longer than that.” </p><p> “All right,” said Haggerty at the end of</p><p>the allotted time. </p><p> “Throw your guns out first,” came the</p><p>order. </p><p> “I don’t see the necessity for that,” ob-</p><p>jected Haggerty. “One man won’t start </p><p>anything with twenty-five.” </p><p> “The -you don’t. It’s me runnin’</p><p>this game. Throw ’em out.” </p><p> “Besides, I’ve only got two guns,” said</p><p>Haggerty, evenly. “What do they matter, </p><p>when there are fifty guns pointed at your </p><p>heads?” </p><p> A moment of terrible silence during which</p><p>Death waited on the decision of the outlaws </p><p>to surrender or give fight; but there are few </p><p>symbols of eternal blackness so paralysing</p><p>as the black muzzle of a loaded revolver; and </p><p>the tension was broken by Sheehy’s joyful </p><p>voice: </p><p> “Bedad, ’tis hard after wearin’ your feet</p><p>to the bones for twenty miles not to have </p><p>even the pleasure of a ruction. Haggerty, </p><p>lad, ’twas your golden trail that saved ye, </p><p>and the mystery of the sound of hammerin’ </p><p>coming out of the solid face of a cliff. And </p><p>now, ye shpalpeens, pay up to the miners’ </p><p>court, the only court of no appeal.” </p><p>A MONTH later Rosa and Hag- </p><p>gerty were leaning on the rail of a </p><p>small stream craft that plowed </p><p>westward around the curves of a wide and </p><p>beautiful river. Illimitable plains of green </p><p>and brown bordered that river on either </p><p>side, stretching away until, somewhere over </p><p>the curve of the earth, they met distant blue </p><p>hills. Everywhere were washes of color </p><p>where the wild flowers grew, orange and </p><p>blue and purple; thousands upon thousands </p><p>of blackbirds dipped to meet the boat; and </p><p>against the saffron sky were long lines of </p><p>waterfowl, their necks outstretched. </p><p>34 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “It is a wonderful country,” said Hag-</p><p>gerty with a note of sadness. </p><p> “It is beautiful here,” assented Rosa.</p><p> “There’s work and wealth here for mil-</p><p>lions,” said Haggerty slowly. “The gold </p><p>is only the lure, it’s the land that counts. </p><p>Some day there’ll be a city on that flat we </p><p>just passed, and wheat from this valley </p><p>will feed it, and help feed the world be- </p><p>sides. It’s a kingdom men have come into </p><p>here.” </p><p> In spite of himself he spoke wistfully.</p><p>That for which he had come to this country </p><p>was finished; Doak was under guard below </p><p>and on the way to expiate the first of his </p><p>crimes; but the country itself, vast and new, </p><p>fresh as from the hand of God and all fitted </p><p>for man’s occupancy and struggles and </p><p>triumphs, gripped at Haggerty’s soul. </p><p> “But you are leaving it,” said Rosa, with</p><p>a catch in her breath, “for me!” </p><p> “Dear heart, don’t think I mind it,” said</p><p>Haggerty swiftly. </p><p> He did; but the land had treated Rosa ill,</p><p>and he knew how the settled orderliness of </p><p>her old home called to her. </p><p> “But I do,” said Rosa, “and I—I’ve been</p><p>thinking. I learned a lot that last month in </p><p>Grizzly. I thought the miners were—were </p><p>savages, Jack; but I found they were men. </p><p>Men needing, maybe, the influence of—of </p><p>people like you and me. And I wouldn’t </p><p>mind—I wouldn’t-” </p><p> Really, the old, old law was working upon</p><p>them both, the law that bids a man cling to </p><p>his work, and the woman to her man. </p><p> “If you mean,” said Haggerty gravely,</p><p>“that all this unsettled condition will pass, </p><p>it will. Think how it was in Grizzly, where </p><p>we used the very wealth of the outlaws, </p><p>stolen wealth, to establish civil government </p><p>and pay the officers of law and order. </p><p>That’s the way it will be everywhere. It </p><p>seems to me sometimes there’s something </p><p>that turns everything to good, even the </p><p>forces of evil. But it will take time.</p><p>Would you be happy in the meantime, </p><p>Rosa?” </p><p> “With you?” questioned Rosa. And</p><p>then, in an altogether different tone, “With </p><p>you, Jack, anywhere. And I’d rather </p><p>stay.” </p><p>THE ROAD TO FRANCE </p><p> BY A.

Then it swings the</p><p>- other way, and a man loses. </p><p>And men call it “Luck.” </p><p> But is it?</p><p> Ted Carling threw two hundred pounds</p><p>of youthful ambition and four days’ grub </p><p>into the trail and broke out with the </p><p>stampede. He was the last man. Ted </p><p>had been asleep when “Old Pete” Johnson </p><p>finally succumbed to the ancient get-him- </p><p>drunk-enough-to-talk scheme and disclosed </p><p>the source of his bulky poke. Ted had </p><p>no hand in that. But when he awoke to </p><p>the swift rasp of many feet in the snow </p><p>going by his cabin and learned the reason </p><p>for it! The spirit-tube hanging outside </p><p>his window said thirty-five below when </p><p>he snapped the padlock on his cabin door </p><p>and swung into the trail. </p><p> Ted grinned grimly. Before him in the</p><p>glow of “The Lights,” stretched out upon </p><p>the flats like a long black snake across the </p><p>glittering snow, a line of fully fifty old- </p><p>timers and as many more newcomers like </p><p>himself drove leg muscles mercilessly. </p><p>Ahead of them, forty miles straight north </p><p>lay Old Pete Johnson’s strike and Poplar </p><p>Creek. Forty miles north, ten—twelve— </p><p>fourteen hours straight-away for those who </p><p>could stand the pace. Poplar Creek lay </p><p>rigid in its Winter bed; its frost-expanding </p><p>waters, somewhere along its course, biting </p><p>off little knobs and big flakes of heavy, dull- </p><p>yellow metal; little knobs and big flakes </p><p>to carry down in the rotting ice in the </p><p>Spring and sink to the bottom—on some- </p><p>body’s claim. And Ted had determined </p><p>to own one of those claims. </p><p> Six feet, even, in his moccasins—“Legs”</p><p>they called him—hard as twenty-two years </p><p>of strenuous honest living could pack him, </p><p>fresh and eager from eight solid hours of </p><p>dreamless sleep, Ted ate up the trail.</p><p>Yard after yard after yard, swiftly and </p><p>surely, his pounding feet closed up the gap </p><p>between him and the tail of that long black </p><p>snake. Mile after mile of the creaking foot- </p><p>packed trail slipped away behind him. </p><p>Then he caught up. </p><p> Three hours out Ted caught up with,</p><p>and passed with a nod, a dozen panting </p><p>men: panting weaklings who would soon </p><p>turn back. Two hours later he set the </p><p>pace for a team of trail-green new men, </p><p>and laughed over his shoulder when he </p><p>bade them good-by. A mile farther he </p><p>swung out to pass the leaders of the rear </p><p>half of the “snake”; and when the brief </p><p>35 </p><p>36 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>day edged up in the south there were just </p><p>six men ahead of him on the last five miles </p><p>to the creek. </p><p> Old-timers those six were, stampeders</p><p>in more than one rush. And with the </p><p>wisdom of experience they had held well </p><p>back to the middle of the line, to the trail </p><p>packcd to slide on. Then, passing with a </p><p>sudden spurt the fagged trail-breakers, </p><p>they strung out a quarter-mile apart in a </p><p>frenzied race across that last lap of five </p><p>miles of unbroken snow. </p><p> But they couldn’t shake Ted. Of average</p><p>height, the six stepped exactly into each </p><p>other’s footprints—footprints too close to- </p><p>gether for Ted’s long legs. Nevertheless, </p><p>Ted gained with every stride. Barring </p><p>accidents or trickery .... </p><p> But nothing was barred in the Poplar</p><p>Creek stampede. The third man ahead </p><p>of Ted stumbled and went down. When </p><p>he got up he sat down again. Those imme- </p><p>diately behind him raced past. Ted </p><p>stopped. </p><p> “All in?” he grinned.</p><p> “All in,-!” came the snarling answer.</p><p>“Look’t that!” And he held up his right </p><p>foot. </p><p> The moccasin on that foot was slit the</p><p>full length of the sole and red with blood, </p><p>and carefully buried in one of the hard- </p><p>packed imprints of the pounding feet ahead </p><p>pointed up and back the six-inch, needle- </p><p>pointed blade of a game-knife! </p><p> Ted dropped to his knee, snorting his</p><p>surprise and disgust. The next minute </p><p>he was on his feet again. A dozen haggard </p><p>men raced past, but he paid no attention. </p><p>It was thirty-odd miles back to Kelly’s, </p><p>and this man couldn’t travel. </p><p> A half-hour later Ted threw his fifth huge</p><p>armful of wood down beside the roaring fire </p><p>and grabbed up his pack. Said he— </p><p> “I’ll be back as soon as I stake.”</p><p> And he was back on the trail again.</p><p> There were eleven men in sight when the</p><p>leader of the stampede reached Old Pete </p><p>Johnson’s claim at the mouth of Poplar </p><p>Creek. Ted was the eleventh. And the </p><p>eleventh five-hundred-foot claim would </p><p>place its owner over a mile up the creek </p><p>valley—over a mile away from the original </p><p>strike. And that was too far! </p><p> Old Pete Johnson was an old prospector.</p><p>Not a man of those there who knew him </p><p>but knew that Old Pete would cover the </p><p>whole creek before he settled down. And </p><p>when Old Pete staked he would measure </p><p>off a full five hundred feet of the very heart </p><p>of the find. If there was any color worth </p><p>working outside Old Pete's claim, it would </p><p>be found next to that claim, up the creek— </p><p>the deep silent river flowed by on the other </p><p>side. Two or three claims up-stream— </p><p>there was a chance; five or six—a possi- </p><p>bility. But a mile up! </p><p> But Ted didn’t get the eleventh claim.</p><p>A man behind him got that. Men behind </p><p>him got the eleventh and the twelfth and— </p><p>Ted stood guard. </p><p>REACHING the mouth of Poplar </p><p>Creek Ted found that one of those </p><p>ahead of him had jumped Old Pete </p><p>Johnson’s claim and was restaking it. </p><p>Whether or not he was the man who </p><p>had planted the knife in the trail, Ted </p><p>didn’t know—no one ever knew anything </p><p>about that. But that didn’t matter. Ted </p><p>stopped. </p><p> “Blind, can’t, see, or what?” He chal-</p><p>lenged shortly. “Didn’t you see Old Pete’s </p><p>notice?” </p><p> “Huh!” the jumper snorted. “Old Pete</p><p>ain’t never registered. If he had, we’d ’a’ </p><p>heard o’ this before.” </p><p> Ted’s fingers in his mitt knotted to an</p><p>iron fist. His long arm shot straight out. </p><p>The first fight was on. </p><p> Then with the arrival of the crowd came</p><p>the general mix-up. </p><p> Axes bit off the stunted spruce, and men</p><p>fought for the stakes. Grub-packs and</p><p>blankets were tossed aside, and men fought </p><p>for position. Mitts were lost, parkas </p><p>were torn off, and men fought for breath. </p><p>And when the flying snow finally settled </p><p>down again, the creek was claimed up- </p><p>stream for a full three miles and only one </p><p>of the thirty who had lasted the forty </p><p>miles had failed to stake. </p><p> That man was Ted.</p><p> Ted stayed on Old Pete Johnson’s claim.</p><p>Down at Kelly’s, when Old Pete Johnson </p><p>sobered enough to realize what his intoxi- </p><p>cated tongue had done, he staggered into </p><p>the registry office and saved his cla;m. </p><p>But Ted didn’t know that. It needed but </p><p>five minutes of Ted’s flying fists to send </p><p>the claim-jumper on up the creek. But </p><p>there were others. Then when the race </p><p>back to register had left the creek deserted, </p><p>and not till then, Ted moved. </p><p> When Ted started anything, he finished</p><p>Luck </p><p>37 </p><p>it. Just because he had come for that </p><p>purpose he staked a claim. With his right </p><p>eye turning blue and rapidly closing and a </p><p>hopeless grin on his swollen features, Ted </p><p>walked three miles up the creek and mea- </p><p>sured off the last claim staked. Then he </p><p>started back. </p><p> The stampede was history when Ted</p><p>registered that claim. Sixty hours after </p><p>the last* man was in, Ted staggered into </p><p>Kelly’s with yet another man across his </p><p>shoulders. And that man had a right foot </p><p>swollen to three times its normal size. The </p><p>frost had got into the knife-wound in the </p><p>sole. </p><p> And the men who had taken part in the</p><p>stampede, the men who knew all the cir- </p><p>cumstances, shrugged their shoulders and </p><p>said— </p><p> “Tough luck.”</p><p> Then came the second stampede to</p><p>Poplar Creek, and Ted was in that, </p><p>too. </p><p> The sun came back, the ice broke up</p><p>and roared down to the river, and Poplar </p><p>Creek was again a living stream. Men </p><p>waded out knee-deep into the numbing </p><p>waters with their pans, washed sand and </p><p>cursed, washed sand and cursed, and went </p><p>back to Kelly’s. Of the thirty-one who </p><p>had staked claims on Poplar Creek but six </p><p>stayed. </p><p> Old Pete Johnson and the four men</p><p>above him washed sand and grinned. But </p><p>three miles up the creek, on the last claim </p><p>staked, Ted Carling .... </p><p> Ted climbed out on to the bank and</p><p>threw his pan into the bushes. He wasn’t </p><p>disappointed. He had staked that claim </p><p>simply because he had mushed forty miles </p><p>for that purpose, and he always finished </p><p>what he started. He threw his long arms </p><p>above his head and yawned—and sat down </p><p>in the creek! </p><p> Ted was a big man and heavy, and the</p><p>throwing up of his long arms added sud-</p><p>denly to his weight. The overhanging </p><p>bank he stood on sagged, and tore loose. </p><p> The water was numbingly cold—the ice</p><p>had been out only a few days. The creek </p><p>bottom was stony there—a hard seat. But </p><p>Ted sat still. Ted sat still and laughed. </p><p> Old Pete Johnson and the four men</p><p>above him were standing out in the creek. </p><p>They were panning sand and finding little </p><p>knobs and big flakes of gold where the </p><p>rotting ice that carried them down began </p><p>to drop them. But Ted Carling sat in the </p><p>creek. Ted was staring at a big raw spot </p><p>where an overhanging bank had broken off </p><p>under his weight. Ted had staked the spot </p><p>where the frost-expanding waters of the </p><p>Winter creek had bitten off all those little </p><p>knobs and big flakes. </p><p> And the men who took part in the</p><p>stampede, the men who knew all the cir- </p><p>cumstances, shrugged their shoulders and </p><p>said— </p><p> “Great luck.”</p><p> And Ted claimed—</p><p>WHEN Ted Carling got back to </p><p>his little home village his mother </p><p>backed him up into a corner and </p><p>demanded the reason for his sudden wealth. </p><p>And Ted laughed and said— </p><p> “Oh, just luck.”</p><p> The pendulum of the fortunes of men</p><p>swings one way, and one man wins. Then </p><p>it swings the other way, and a man loses. </p><p>And men call it “Luck.” </p><p> But is it?</p><p>Author of “Yahoya,” "Silver Slippersetc. </p><p>E WHO lias not heard the bells of </p><p>San Juan has a journey yet to </p><p>make.

At the northern end, that is </p><p>toward the more inviting mountains, is the </p><p>old mission. To right and left of the white- </p><p>washed corridors in a straggling garden of </p><p>pear-trees and olives and yellow roses are </p><p>two rude arches made of seasoned cedar. </p><p>From the top cross-beam of each hang three </p><p>bells. </p><p> They have their history, these bells of</p><p>San Juan and the biggest with its deep, </p><p>mellow voice, the smallest with its golden </p><p>chimes, seem to be chanting it when they </p><p>ring. Each swinging Longue has its tale to </p><p>tell, a tale of old Spain, of Spanish galleons </p><p>and Spanish gentlemen adventurers, of </p><p>gentle-voiced priests and somber-eyed In- </p><p>dians, of conquest, revolt, intrigue and sud- </p><p>den death. </p><p> When a baby is born in San Juan, a</p><p>rarer occurrence than a strong man’s </p><p>death, the littlest of the bells upon the </p><p>western arch laughs while it calls to all to </p><p>harken; when a man is killed the angry- </p><p>toned bell pendant from the eastern arch </p><p>shouts out the word to go billowing across </p><p>the stretches of sage and greasewood and </p><p>gama grass; if one of the later day frame </p><p>buildings bursts into flame Ignacio Chavez </p><p>warns the town with a strident clamor, </p><p>tugging frantically; be it wedding or dis- </p><p>covery of gold or returns from the country </p><p>THE </p><p>T)LLLS oT </p><p>JAN JUAN </p><p>A FOUR_~PAR_T JTORY </p><p>PART 1</p><p>^^Jack/on </p><p>Gregory </p><p>The Bells of San Juan </p><p>39 </p><p>elections, the bell ringer cunningly makes </p><p>the bells talk. </p><p> Out on the desert a man might stop and</p><p>listen, forming his surmise as the sounds </p><p>surged out through the heat and silence. </p><p>He might smile, if he knew San Juan, as he </p><p>caught the jubilant message of the tones </p><p>tapped swiftly out of the bronze bell which </p><p>had come, men said, with Coronado; he </p><p>might sigh at the lugubrious, slow swelling </p><p>voice of the big bell which had come hither- </p><p>ward long ago with the retinue of Marco de </p><p>Niza, wondering what old friend or enemy, </p><p>perchance, had at last closed his ears to all </p><p>of Ignacio Chavez’s music. Or, at a sudden </p><p>fury of clanging, the man far out on the </p><p>desert might hurry on, cursing and goading </p><p>his burro impatiently, to know what great </p><p>event had occurred in the old adobe town of </p><p>San Juan. </p><p> It is three hundred and fifty years and</p><p>more since the six bells of San Juan came </p><p>into the new world and tolled across that </p><p>land of quiet mystery which is the south- </p><p>west. It is a hundred years since an all but </p><p>forgotten priest, Francisco Calderon, found </p><p>them in various devastated mission churches, </p><p>assembled them and set them chiming in </p><p>the old garden. Where, among the pear- </p><p>trees and olives and yellow roses, they still </p><p>cast their shadows in sun and moonlight, </p><p>in silence and in echoing chimes. </p><p>CHAPTER I </p><p>IGNACIO CHAVEZ, Mexican </p><p>that he styled himself, Indian </p><p>that. the community deemed him </p><p>or “breed” of badly mixed blood that he </p><p>probably was, made his loitering way along </p><p>the street toward the mission. A thin, </p><p>yellowish-brown cigarita dangling from his </p><p>lips, his wide, dilapidated conical hat tilted </p><p>to the left side of his head in a listless sort </p><p>of consession to the westering sun, he was, </p><p>as was customary with him, utterly at </p><p>peace. </p><p> Ten minutes ago he had had twenty</p><p>cents; two minutes after the acquiring of </p><p>his elusive wealth he had exchanged the two </p><p>dimes for whisky at the Casa Blanca; the </p><p>remaining eight minutes of the ten he re-</p><p>quired to make his way, as he naively put it, </p><p>“between hell and heaven.” </p><p> For from a corner of the peaceful old mis-</p><p>sion garden at one end of the long street one </p><p>might catch a glimpse of the Casa Blanca at </p><p>the other end sprawling in the sun; between </p><p>the two sturdy walled buildings had the </p><p>town strung itself as it grew. As old a relic </p><p>as the church itself was La Casa Blanca and, </p><p>since San Juan could remember, in all mat- </p><p>ters antipodal to the religious calm of the </p><p>padre’s monument. Deep-shaded door- </p><p>ways let into the three-feet-thick earthen </p><p>walls, waxed floors, green tables and bar and </p><p>cool-looking glasses—a place which invited, </p><p>lured, held and frequently enough finally </p><p>damned. </p><p> San Juan, in the languid philosophy of</p><p>Ignacio Chavez, was what you will. It </p><p>epitomized the universe. You had every- </p><p>thing here which the soul of man might </p><p>covet. Never having dwelt elsewhere since </p><p>his mother bore him here upon the rim of the </p><p>desert and with the San Juan Mountains </p><p>so near that, Ignacio Chavez pridefully </p><p>knew, a man standing upon the Mesa Alta </p><p>might hear the ringing of his bells, he expe- </p><p>rienced a pitying contempt for all those </p><p>other spots in the world which were so </p><p>plainly less favored. </p><p> What do you wish, senor? Fine warm</p><p>days? You have them here. Nice cool </p><p>nights for sound slumber? Right here in </p><p>San Juan, amigo mio. A desert across </p><p>which the eye may run without stopping </p><p>until it be tired, a wonderful desert whereon </p><p>at dawn and dusk God weaves all of the </p><p>alluring soft mists of mystery. Shaded </p><p>canons at noonday with water and birds and </p><p>flowers. Behold the mountains. Every- </p><p>thing desirable, in short. </p><p> That there might be men who desired the</p><p>splash of waves, the sheen of wet beaches, </p><p>the boom of surf, did not suggest itself to </p><p>one who had never seen the ocean. So, then, </p><p>San Juan was “what you will.” A man </p><p>may fix his eye upon the little mission cross </p><p>which is always pointing to heaven and God; </p><p>or he may pass through the shaded doors of </p><p>the Casa Blanca which, men say, give exit </p><p>into hell the shortest way. </p><p> Ignacio, having meditatively enjoyed his</p><p>whisky and listened smilingly to the tinkle </p><p>of a mandolin in the patio under a grape- </p><p>vine arbor, had rolled his cigaret and turned </p><p>his back square upon the devil—of whom he </p><p>no longer had anything to ask. As he went </p><p>out he stopped in the doorway long enough </p><p>to rub his back against a comer of the wall </p><p>and to strike a match. Then, almost in- </p><p>audibly humming the mandolin air, he </p><p>slouched out into the burning street. </p><p>40 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> For twenty years he had striven with the</p><p>weeds in the mission garden and no man </p><p>during that time dared say which had had </p><p>the best of it, Ignacio Chavez or the inter- </p><p>loping alfileria and purslane. In the mat- </p><p>ters of a vast leisureliness and tumbling </p><p>along the easiest way they resembled each </p><p>other, these two avowed enemies. </p><p> For twenty years he had looked upon the</p><p>bells as his own, had filled his eye with </p><p>them day after day, had looked the first </p><p>thing in the morning to see that they were </p><p>there, regarding them as solicitously in the </p><p>rare rainy weather as his old mother re- </p><p>garded her few mongrel chicks. Twenty </p><p>full years, and yet Ignacio Chavez was </p><p>not more than thirty years old, or thirty- </p><p>five perhaps. He did not know, no one </p><p>cared. </p><p> He was on his way to attack with his bare</p><p>brown hands some of the weeds which were </p><p>spilling over into the walk which led through </p><p>the garden and to the priest’s house. As a </p><p>matter of fact he had awakened with this </p><p>purpose in mind, had gone his lazy way all </p><p>day fully purposing to give it his attention, </p><p>and had at last arrived upon the scene. </p><p> The front gate had finally broken, the</p><p>upper hinge worn out; Ignacio carefully set </p><p>the ramshackly wooden affair back against </p><p>the fence thinking how one of these days he </p><p>would repair it. Then he went between the </p><p>bigger pear-tree and the lluvia d'oro which </p><p>his own hands had planted here and stood </p><p>with legs well apart considering the three </p><p>bells upon the easterly arch. </p><p> “Que hay, amigos/” he greeted them.</p><p>“Do you know what I am going to do for </p><p>you some fine day? I will build a little roof </p><p>over you that runs down both ways to shut </p><p>out the water when it rains. It will make </p><p>you hoarse, too much rain.” </p><p> That was one of the few dreams of Igna-</p><p>cio’s life; one day he was going to make a </p><p>little roof over each arch. But today he </p><p>merely regarded affectionately the Captain </p><p>—that was the biggest of the bells—the </p><p>Dancer, second in size, and Lolita, the </p><p>smallest upon this arch. Then he sighed </p><p>and turned toward the other arch across the</p><p>garden to see how it was with the Little </p><p>One, La Golondrina and Ignacio Chavez. </p><p>For it was only fair that at least one of the </p><p>six should bear his name. </p><p> Changing his direction thus, moving di-</p><p>rectly toward the dropping sun, he shifted </p><p>his hat well over his eyes and so was con- </p><p>strained to note how the weeds were assert- </p><p>ing themselves with renewed insolence. He </p><p>muttered a soft “malditol” at them winch </p><p>might have been mistaken for a caress and </p><p>determined upon a merciless campaign of </p><p>extermination just as soon as he could have </p><p>fitted a new handle to his hoe. </p><p> Then he paused in front of the mission</p><p>steps and lifted his hat, made an elegant </p><p>bow and smiled in his own inimitable re- </p><p>markably fascinating way. For, under the </p><p>ragged brim, his eyes had caught a glimpse </p><p>of a pretty pair of patent-leather slippers, a </p><p>prettier pair of black stockinged ankles and </p><p>the hem of a white starched skirt. </p><p> Nowhere are there eyes like the eyes of</p><p>old Mexico. Deep and soft and soulful, </p><p>though the man himself may have a soul </p><p>like a bit of charred leather; velvety and </p><p>tender though they may belong to an out- </p><p>and-out cutthroat; expressive, eloquent </p><p>even, though they are the eyes of a peon </p><p>with no mind to speak of; night black and </p><p>like the night filled with mystery. Ignacio </p><p>Chavez lifted such eyes to the eyes of the </p><p>girl who had been watching him and spon- </p><p>taneously gave her the last iota of his ready </p><p>admiration. </p><p> “It is a fine day, senorita,” he told her,</p><p>displaying two glistening rows of superb </p><p>teeth friendliwise. “And the garden—ah, </p><p>que es mas bonita en lodo el mundo? You </p><p>like it, no?” </p><p> It was slow music when Ignacio Chavez</p><p>spoke, all liquid sounds and tender cadences. </p><p>When he had cursed the weeds it was like </p><p>love-making. A “d” in his mouth became </p><p>a softened “th;” from the lips of such as </p><p>the bell-ringer of San Juan the snapping </p><p>gringo oath comes metamorphosed into a </p><p>gentle “Gah-tham!” The girl, to whom </p><p>the speech of Chavez was something as </p><p>new and strange as the face of the earth </p><p>about her, regarded him with grave curious </p><p>eyes.</p><p>SHE was seated upon the little </p><p>bench against the mission wall </p><p>which no one but Ignacio guessed </p><p>was to be painted green one of these fine </p><p>days, a bronze-haired, gray-eyed girl in </p><p>white skirt and waist and with a wide pana- </p><p>ma hat caught between her clasped hands </p><p>and her knee. For a moment she was per- </p><p>haps wondering how to take him; then with </p><p>a suddenness that had been all unheralded </p><p>in her former gravity, she smiled. With </p><p>The Bells of San Juan </p><p>4i </p><p>lips and eyes together as though she ac- </p><p>cepted his friendship. Ignacio’s own smile </p><p>broadened and he nodded his delight. </p><p> “It is truly beautiful here,” she ad-</p><p>mitted, and had Ignacio possessed a tithe of </p><p>that sympathetic comprehension which his </p><p>eyes lied about he would have detected a </p><p>little note of eagerness in her voice, would </p><p>even have guessed that she was lonely and </p><p>craved human companionship. “I have </p><p>been sitting here an hour or two. You are </p><p>not going to send me away, are you?” </p><p>Ignacio looked properly horrified. </p><p> “If I saw an angel here in the garden,</p><p>senorita,” he exclaimed, “would I say sape </p><p>to it? No, no, senorita; here you shall stay </p><p>a thousand years if you wish. I swear it.” </p><p>He was all sincerity; Ignacio Chavez </p><p>would no sooner think of being rude to a </p><p>beautiful young woman than of crying </p><p>“Scat!” to an angel. But as to staying here </p><p>a thousand years—she glanced through the </p><p>tangle of the garden to the tiny grave- </p><p>yard and shook her head. </p><p> “You have just come to San Juan?” he</p><p>asked. “Today?” </p><p> “Yes,” she told him. “On the stage at</p><p>noon.” </p><p> “You have friends here?”</p><p> Again she shook her head.</p><p> “Ah,” said Ignacio.</p><p> He straightened for a brief instant and</p><p>she could see how the chest under his shirt </p><p>inflated. </p><p> “A tourist. You have heard of this gar-</p><p>den, maybe? And the bells? So you </p><p>traveled across the desert to see?” </p><p> The third time she shook her head.</p><p> “I have come to live here,” she returned</p><p>quietly. </p><p> “But not all alone, senorita!”</p><p> “Yes.” She smiled at him again. “All</p><p>alone.” </p><p> “Mother of God!” he said within himself.</p><p>And presently to her, “I did not see the </p><p>stage come today; in San Juan one takes </p><p>his siesta at that hour. And it is not often </p><p>that the stage brings new people from the </p><p>railroad.” </p><p> In some subtle way he had made of his</p><p>explanation an apology. While his slow </p><p>brown fingers rolled a cigaret he stared away </p><p>through the garden and across the desert </p><p>with an expression half-melancholy, half- </p><p>merely meditative which made the girl </p><p>wonder what his thoughts were. When she </p><p>came to know him better she would know, </p><p>too, that at times like this he was not think- </p><p>ing at all. </p><p> “I think that this is the most profoundly</p><p>peaceful place in the world,” said the girl </p><p>quietly, half-listlesslv setting into words the </p><p>impression which had clung about her </p><p>throughout the long, still day. “It is like </p><p>a strange dream town; one sees no one mov- </p><p>ing about, hears nothing. It is just a little </p><p>sad, isn’t it?” </p><p> He had followed her until the end, com-</p><p>prehending. But sad? How was that? It </p><p>was just as it should be; to ears which had </p><p>never been filled with the noises or rushing </p><p>trains and cars and all of the traffic of a city, </p><p>what sadness could there be in the very </p><p>natural calm of the rim of the desert? </p><p>Having no satisfactory reply to make, Igna- </p><p>cio merely muttered “Si, senorita,” some- </p><p>what helplessly and let it go at that. </p><p> “Tell me,” she continued, sitting up a</p><p>little and seeming to throw off the oppres- </p><p>sively heavy spell of her environment, </p><p>“who are the important people here- </p><p>abouts?” </p><p> La geiite? Oh, Ignacio knew them well,</p><p>all of them! There was Senor Engle, to be- </p><p>gin with. The banker of whom no doubt </p><p>she had heard? He owned a big residencia </p><p>just yonder; you could catch the gleam of </p><p>its white walls through a clump of cotton- </p><p>woods, withdrawn aloofly from San Juan’s </p><p>street. Many men worked for him; he had </p><p>big cattle and sheep ranches throughout the </p><p>country; he paid well and loaned out much </p><p>money. Also he had a beautiful wife and a</p><p>truly marvelously beautiful daughter. And </p><p>horses such as one could not look upon </p><p>elsewhere. </p><p> Then there was Senor Nortone, as Ignacio</p><p>pronounced him; a sincere friend of Ignacio </p><p>Chavez and a man fearless and true and </p><p>extravagantly to. be admired who, it ap- </p><p>peared, was the sheriff. Not a family man; </p><p>lie was too young yet. But soon; oh, one </p><p>could see! It would be Ignacio who would </p><p>ring the bells for the wedding when Rode- </p><p>rico married himself with the daughter of </p><p>the banker. </p><p> “He is what you call a gunman, isn’t</p><p>he?” asked the girl, interested. “I heard </p><p>two of the men on the stage talking of him. </p><p>They called him Roddy Norton; he is the </p><p>one, isn’t he?” </p><p> Seguro; sure, he was the one. A gun-</p><p>man? Ignacio shrugged. He was sheriff </p><p>and what must a sheriff be if not a gunman? </p><p>42 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “On the stage,” continued the girl, “was a</p><p>man they called Doc; and another named </p><p>Galloway. They are San Juan men, are </p><p>they not?” </p><p> Ignacio lifted his brows a shade dis-</p><p>dainfully. They were both San Juan citi- </p><p>zens but obviously not to his liking. Jim </p><p>Galloway was a big man, yes; but of la </p><p>genie, never! The setiorila should look the </p><p>other way when he passed. He owned the </p><p>Casa Blanca; that was enough to ticket him </p><p>and Ignacio passed quickly to el senor </p><p>doctor. Oh, he was smart and did much good </p><p>to the sick; but the poor Mexican who </p><p>called him for a bed-ridden wife must first </p><p>sell something and show the money. </p><p> Beyond these it appeared that the envi-</p><p>able class of San Juan consisted of the </p><p>Padre Jose, who was at present and much </p><p>of the time away visiting the poor and sick </p><p>throughout the countryside; Julius Struve </p><p>who owned and operated the local hotel, one </p><p>of the lesser luminaries though a portly </p><p>gentleman with an amiable wife; the Por- </p><p>ters who had a farm off to the northwest and </p><p>whose connection to San Juan lay in the </p><p>fact that an old maid daughter taught the </p><p>school here; various other individuals and </p><p>family groups to be disposed of with a word </p><p>and a careless wave of a cigaret. Already </p><p>for the fair stranger Ignacio had skimmed </p><p>the cream of the cream. </p><p> The girl sighed as though her question</p><p>had been no idle one and his reply had disap- </p><p>pointed her. For a moment her brows </p><p>gathered slightly into a frown that was </p><p>like a faint shadow; then she smiled </p><p>again brightly, a quick smile which seemed </p><p>more at home in her eyes than the frown had </p><p>been. </p><p> Ignacio glanced from her to the weeds,</p><p>then, squinting his eyes, at the sun. There </p><p>was ample time, it would be cooler pres- </p><p>ently. So, describing a respectful arc about </p><p>her he approached the mission wall, slipped </p><p>into the shade and eased himself in charac- </p><p>teristic indolence against the white-washed </p><p>adobe. She appeared willing to talk with </p><p>him; well, then, what pleasanter way to </p><p>spend an afternoon? She sought to learn </p><p>this and that of a land new to her; who to</p><p>explain more knowingly than Ignacio </p><p>Chavez? </p><p> After a little, when she rose to go, he</p><p>would pluck some of the newly opened yel- </p><p>low rosebuds for her, making her a little </p><p>speech about herself and budding flowers. </p><p>He would even, perhaps, show her his bells, </p><p>let her hear just the suspicion of a note from </p><p>each. </p><p> A sharp sound which came to her ab-</p><p>ruptly out of the utter stillness meant noth- </p><p>ing to her. She saw a flock of pigeons rise </p><p>above the roofs of the more distant of the </p><p>houses, circle, swerve and disappear beyond </p><p>the cottonwoods. She noted that Ignacio </p><p>was no longer leaning lazily against the </p><p>wall; that he had stiffened, that his mouth </p><p>was a little open, breathless, his attitude </p><p>that of one listening expectantly, his eyes </p><p>squinting as they had been just now when </p><p>he fronted the sun. </p><p> Then came the second sound, a repetition</p><p>of the first, sharp, in some way sinister. </p><p>Then another and another and another un- </p><p>til she lost count; a man’s voice crying out </p><p>strangely, muffled, indistinct, seeming to </p><p>come from afar. </p><p> It was an incongruous, almost a humorous</p><p>thing to see the sun-warmed passivity of </p><p>Ignacio Chavez metamorphosed in a flash </p><p>into activity. He had muttered something, </p><p>had leaped away from the mission wall, </p><p>dashed through the tangle of the garden and </p><p>raced like a madman to the eastern arch. </p><p>With both hands he grasped the dangling </p><p>bell ropes, with all of his might he had set </p><p>them clanging and shouting and clamoring </p><p>until the reverberation smote her ears and </p><p>set the blood strangely tingling through her. </p><p>She had seen the look upon his face. </p><p> Suddenly she knew that those little sharp</p><p>sounds had been the rattle of pistol shots. </p><p>She sprang to her feet, her eyes widening, </p><p>her cheeks growing pale. Now all was </p><p>quiet save for the boom and roar of the </p><p>bells. The pigeons were circling high in the </p><p>clear sky, were coming back. She went </p><p>quickly the way Ignacio had gonj, calling </p><p>out to him- </p><p> “What is it?”</p><p> He seemed all unmoved now as he made</p><p>his bells cry out for him; it was for him to be </p><p>calm while they trembled with the event </p><p>which surely they must understand. </p><p> “It is a man dead,” he told her, as his</p><p>right hand called upon the Captain for a </p><p>volume of sound from his bronze throat. </p><p>“You will see. And there will be more </p><p>work for RodericoNortone!” He sighed and </p><p>shook his head and for a moment spoke </p><p>softly with his jangling bells. “And some </p><p>day,” he continued quietly, “it will be </p><p>Roderico’s time, no? And I will ring the </p><p>The Bells of San Juan </p><p>43 </p><p>bells for him and the Captain and the Dan- </p><p>cer and Lolita, they will all put tears into </p><p>men’s eyes. But first, Santa Maria, let it </p><p>be that I ring the others for him when he </p><p>marries himself with the banker’s daugh- </p><p>ter.” </p><p> “A man dead?” the girl repeated, un-</p><p>willing to grasp fully. </p><p> “You will see,” returned Ignacio.</p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>THE GIRL in the old mission gar- </p><p>den stood staring at Ignacio Chavez </p><p>a long time, seeming compelled by a </p><p>force greater than her own to watch him </p><p>tugging and jerking at his bells. Plainly </p><p>enough she understood that this, was an </p><p>alarm being sounded; a man dead through </p><p>violence and the bell-ringer stirring the </p><p>town with it. But when presently he let </p><p>two of the ropes slip out of his hands and </p><p>began a slow, mournful tolling of the Cap- </p><p>tain alone, she shuddered a little and with- </p><p>drew. </p><p> That it might be merely a case of a man</p><p>wounded, even badly wounded, did not </p><p>once suggest itself to her. Ignacio had </p><p>spoken as one who knew, in full confidence </p><p>and with finality. She should see! She </p><p>went back to the little bench which one day </p><p>was to be a bright green and sat down. </p><p>She could see that again the pigeons were </p><p>circling excitedly; that from the baking </p><p>street little puffs of dust arose to hang idly </p><p>in the still air as though they were painted </p><p>upon the clear canvas of the sky. She </p><p>heard the voices of men, faint quick sounds </p><p>against the tolling of the bell. Then sud- </p><p>denly all was very still once more; Ignacio </p><p>had allowed the Captain to resume his silent </p><p>brooding, and came to her. </p><p> “I must go to see who it is,” he apologized.</p><p>“Then I will know better how to ring for </p><p>him. The sheepman from Las Palmas, I </p><p>bet you. For did I not see when just now I </p><p>passed the Casa Blanca that he was a little </p><p>drunk with Senor Galloway’s whisky? </p><p>And does not every one know he sold many </p><p>sheep and that means much money these </p><p>days? Si, senorita; it will be the sheepman</p><p>from Las Palmas.” </p><p> He was gone, slouching along again and in</p><p>no haste now that he had fulfilled his first </p><p>duty. What haste could there possibly be </p><p>since, sheepman from Las Palmas or an- </p><p>other, he was dead and therefore must wait </p><p>upon Ignacio Chavez’s pleasure? Some- </p><p>how she gleaned this thought from his man- </p><p>ner and therefore did not speak as she </p><p>watched him depart. </p><p> That portion of the street which she could</p><p>see from where she sat was empty, the dust </p><p>settling, thinning, disappearing. Further </p><p>down toward the Casa Blanca she could </p><p>imagine the little knots of men asking one </p><p>another what had happened and how; the </p><p>chief actor in this fragment of human drama </p><p>she could picture lying inert, uncaring that </p><p>it was for him that a bell had tolled and </p><p>would toll again, that men congregated </p><p>curiously. </p><p> In a little while Ignacio would return,</p><p>shuffling, smoking a dangling cigaret, his </p><p>hat cocked against the sun; he would give </p><p>her full particulars and then return to his </p><p>bell. </p><p> She had come to San Juan to make a</p><p>home here, to become a part of it, to make it </p><p>a portion of her. To arrive upon a day like </p><p>this was no pleasant omen; it was too dread- </p><p>fully like taking a room in a house only to </p><p>hear the life rattling out of a man beyond a </p><p>partition. She was suddenly averse to </p><p>hearing Ignacio’s details; there came a </p><p>quick desire to set her back to the town </p><p>whose silence on the heels of uproar </p><p>crushed her. </p><p> Rising hastily she went with quick steps</p><p>down the weed-bordered walk, out at the </p><p>broken gate and turned toward the moun- </p><p>tains. One glance down the street as she </p><p>crossed it showed her what she had ex- </p><p>pected; a knot of men at the door of the </p><p>Casa Blanca, another small group at a win- </p><p>dow, evidently taking stock of a broken </p><p>window-pane. </p><p> The sun, angry and red, was hanging low</p><p>over a distant line of hills, the face of the </p><p>fiat lands were already drawing about them </p><p>a thin faintly colorful haze. She had put </p><p>on her hat and, like Ignacio, had set it a</p><p>little to the side of her head, feeling her </p><p>cheeks burning when the direct rays found </p><p>them. The fine, loose soil was sifting into </p><p>her low slippers before she had gone a score </p><p>of paces. When she came back she would </p><p>unpack her trunk and get out a sensible pair </p><p>of boots. No doubt she was dressed ridic- </p><p>ulously, but then the heat had tempted </p><p>her. </p><p> A curious matter presented itself to her:</p><p>in the little groups upon the street she had </p><p>not seen a single woman. Were there none </p><p>44 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>in San Juan? Was this some strange, alto- </p><p>gether masculine community which she had </p><p>stumbled into? Then she remembered </p><p>how the bell-ringer had mentioned Mrs. </p><p>Engle, the banker’s wife, and his daughter </p><p>and Mrs. Struve and others. Besides all </p><p>this she had a letter to Mrs. Engle which she </p><p>was going to present this evening. </p><p> She was thinking of anything in the world</p><p>but of a tragedy not yet grown cold, so near </p><p>her that for a little it had seemed to em- </p><p>brace her. Now it was almost as though it </p><p>had not occurred. The world was all un- </p><p>changed about her, the town somnolent. </p><p>She had shuddered as Ignacio played upon </p><p>his bell; but the shudder was rather from </p><p>the bell’s resonant eloquence than from any </p><p>more vital cause. </p><p> A man she had never seen, whose name</p><p>even she did not know, had been shot by </p><p>another man unknown to her; she had heard </p><p>only the shots; she had seen nothing. </p><p>True, she had heard also a voice crying out, </p><p>but she sensed that it had been the voice of </p><p>an onlooker. She felt ashamed that the </p><p>episode did not move her more. </p><p> As, earlier in the afternoon, she had been</p><p>drawn from the heat of her room at Struve’s </p><p>hotel by the shade to be found in the mission </p><p>garden, so now did a long, wavering line of </p><p>cottonwoods beckon to her. In files which </p><p>turned eastward or westward here and there </p><p>only to come back to the general northerly </p><p>trend, they indicated where an arroyo </p><p>writhed down, tortured-serpent-wise, from </p><p>the mountains. Through their foliage she </p><p>had glimpsed the Engle home. She ex- </p><p>pected to find running water under their </p><p>shade, that and an attendant coolness. </p><p> But the arroyo proved to be dry and hot,</p><p>a gap in the dry bosom of the earth, its bot- </p><p>tom strewn with smooth pebbles and sand </p><p>and a very sparse, unattractive vegetation, </p><p>stunted and harsh. And it was almost as </p><p>hot here as on San Juan’s street; into the </p><p>shade crept the heat waves of the dry, </p><p>scorched air. </p><p> Led by the line of cottonwoods, seeking</p><p>action rather than coolness yet craving </p><p>both, she found a little path and followed it,</p><p>experiencing a vague relief to have the little </p><p>town at her back. She knew that distances </p><p>deceived the eye in this bleak land, and yet </p><p>she thought that before dark she could </p><p>reach the hills, idle there where perhaps </p><p>there were a few languid flowers and pools, </p><p>returning just tired enough to eat and go </p><p>to sleep. She rather thought that she </p><p>woukl postpone her call on the Engles until </p><p>tomorrow. </p><p> “It’s manana-land, after all,” she told</p><p>herself, with a quick smile. </p><p> Half an hour later she found a spot 'where</p><p>the trees stood in a denser growth, looking </p><p>greener, more vigorous—less thirsty. She </p><p>could fancy the great roots, questing far </p><p>downward through the layers of dry soil, </p><p>thrusting themselves almost with a human, </p><p>passionate eagerness into the water they </p><p>had found. Here she threw herself down, </p><p>lying upon her back, gazing up through the </p><p>branches and leaves. </p><p> Never until now had she known the mean-</p><p>ing of utter stillness. She saw a bird, a poor </p><p>brown unkempt little being; it had no song </p><p>to offer the silence and in a little while flew </p><p>away listlessly. She had seen a rabbit, </p><p>a big gaunt uncomely wretch of a thing, </p><p>disappearing silently among the clumps of </p><p>brush. </p><p> Her spirit, essentially bright and happy,</p><p>had striven hard with a new form of weari- </p><p>ness all day. Not only was she coming into </p><p>another land than that which she knew and </p><p>understood; she was entering another phase </p><p>of her life. She had chosen voluntarily, </p><p>without device or suggestion; she had had </p><p>her reasons and they had seemed sufficient, </p><p>they were still sufficient. She had chosen </p><p>wisely; she held to that, her judgment un- </p><p>troubled. </p><p> But that stubbornly recurrent sense that</p><p>with the old landmarks she had abandoned </p><p>the old life; that both in physical fact and in </p><p>spiritual and mental actuality she was at the </p><p>threshold of an unguessed, essentially differ- </p><p>ent life, was disquieting. There is no get- </p><p>ting away from an old.basic truth that a </p><p>man’s life is so strongly influenced as almost </p><p>to be molded by his environment; there </p><p>was uneasiness in the thought that here </p><p>one’s existence might grow to resemble his</p><p>habitat, taking on the gray tone and mo- </p><p>notony and bleak barrenness of this sun- </p><p>smitten land. </p><p> Yielding a little already to the command</p><p>laid upon breathing nature hereabouts she </p><p>was lying still, her hands lax, her thoughts </p><p>taking unto themselves something of the </p><p>character of the listless, songless brown </p><p>bird’s flight. She had come here today </p><p>following in the footsteps of other men and a </p><p>few women. Her own selection of San </p><p>Juan was explicable; the thing to wonder at </p><p>The Bells of San Juan </p><p>45 </p><p>was what had given the hardihood to the </p><p>first men to stop here and make houses and </p><p>then homes? </p><p> Later she would know; the one magic</p><p>word of the desert lands: water. For San </p><p>Juan, standing midway between the rail- </p><p>road and the more tempting lands beyond </p><p>the mountains, had found birth here because </p><p>there was a mudhole for cradle; down under </p><p>the sand were fortuitous layers of impervi- </p><p>ous clay cupping to hold much sweet water. </p><p>HTHE SLOW tolling of a bell came </p><p>billowing out through the silence. </p><p>The girl sat up. It was the Cap- </p><p>tain. Never, it seemed to her, had she </p><p>heard anything so mournful. Ignacio had </p><p>informed himself concerning all details and </p><p>had returned to the garden at the mission. </p><p>The man was dead, then. There could be </p><p>no doubt as one listened to the measured </p><p>sorrowing of the big bell. </p><p> She got to her feet and walking swiftly</p><p>moved on, still further away from San Juan. </p><p>The act was without premeditation; her </p><p>whole being was insistent upon it. She </p><p>wondered if it was the sheepman from Las </p><p>Palmas; if he had, perhaps, a wife and </p><p>children. Then she stopped suddenly; a </p><p>new thought had come to her. Strange, </p><p>inexplicable even, it had not suggested it- </p><p>self before. </p><p> She wondered who the other man was, the</p><p>man who had done the killing. And what </p><p>had happened to him? Had he fled? Had </p><p>other men grappled with him, disarmed him, </p><p>made of him a prisoner to answer for what </p><p>he had done? What had been his motive, </p><p>what passion had actuated him? Surely </p><p>not just the greed for gold which the bell- </p><p>ringer had suggested! What sort of a crea- </p><p>ture was he who, in cold, calculating blood </p><p>could murder a man for a handful of </p><p>money? </p><p> There was nothing to answer unless she</p><p>could catch the thought of Ignacio Chavez </p><p>in the ringing of his bell. She moved on </p><p>again, hurrying. </p><p> Following the arroyo she had come to the</p><p>first of the little, smooth hills, the lomas as</p><p>the men on the stage had named them. </p><p>Through them the dry watercourse wrig- </p><p>gled, carrying its green pennons along its </p><p>marge. She went up gentle slopes mantled </p><p>with bleached grass which under her eyes </p><p>was white in the glare of the sun. But the </p><p>sun was very low now, very fierce and red, </p><p>an angry god going down in temporary de- </p><p>feat but defiant to the last, filled with threat </p><p>for tomorrow. </p><p> The far western uplands cut the great</p><p>disc squarely in two; down slipped the half- </p><p>wafer until it seemed that just a bright </p><p>signal-fire was kindled upon the ridge. </p><p>And as that faded from her eyes the slow </p><p>sobbing of the swinging bell was like a wail </p><p>for the death of the day. </p><p> She had removed her hat, fancying that</p><p>already the earth was throwing off its heat, </p><p>that a little coolness and freshness was com- </p><p>ing down to meet her from the mountains. </p><p>She turned her eyes toward them and then, </p><p>just after the sunset, it was that she saw a </p><p>man riding toward her. He was still far off </p><p>when she first glimpsed him, half or </p><p>three-quarters of a mile, just cresting one of </p><p>the higher hills so that for him the sun had </p><p>not yet set. For she caught the glint of </p><p>light flaming back from the silver chasings </p><p>of his bridle and from the barrel of the gun </p><p>across the hollow of his left arm. She did </p><p>not believe that he had seen her in the </p><p>shadow of the cottonwoods. </p><p> If she went on sh6 must meet him pres-</p><p>ently. She glanced back over her shoulder, </p><p>noting how far she had come from the town. </p><p>It was very still again; the bell had ceased </p><p>its complaint; the hoofs of the approaching </p><p>horse seemed shod with felt, falling upon </p><p>felt. She swung about and walked back </p><p>toward San Juan. </p><p> A little later she heard the man’s voice,</p><p>calling. Clearly to her since there was no </p><p>one else. Why should he call to her? She </p><p>gave no sign of having heard but walked on </p><p>a trifle faster. She sensed that he was gal- </p><p>loping down upon her; sensed merely for </p><p>still in the loose sand the hoofbeats were </p><p>muffled. Then he called again and she </p><p>stopped and turned and waited. </p><p> A splendid big fellow he was, she noted</p><p>as he came on, riding a splendid big horse.</p><p>Man and beast seemed to belong to the </p><p>desert; had it not been for the glint of the </p><p>sun she realized now she would probably not </p><p>have distinguished their distant forms from </p><p>the land across which they had moved. </p><p>The horse was a darkish, dull gray; the </p><p>man, boots, corduroy breeches, soft shirt </p><p>and hat, was garbed in gray or so covered </p><p>with the dust of travel as to seem so. </p><p> “What in the world are you doing way out</p><p>here?” he called to her. And then having </p><p>come closer he reined in his horse, stared at </p><p>46 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>her a moment in surprised wonderment, </p><p>swept off his hat and said, a shade awk- </p><p>wardly: “I beg pardon. I thought you </p><p>were some one else.” </p><p> For her wide hat was again drooping</p><p>about her face and he had had just the form </p><p>of hor and the white skirt and waist to </p><p>judge by. </p><p> "It is all right,” she said lightly. “I</p><p>imagined that you had made a mistake.” </p><p> It was something of a victory over herself</p><p>to have succeeded in speaking thus care- </p><p>lessly. For there had been the impulse, a </p><p>temptation almost, just to stare back at the </p><p>man as he had stared at her and in silence. </p><p>Not only was the type physically magnifi- </p><p>cent; to her it was, like everything about </p><p>her, new. And that which had held her at </p><p>first was his eyes. </p><p> For it is not the part of youth to be stern-</p><p>eyed; and while this man could not be more </p><p>than midway between twenty and thirty, </p><p>his eyes had already acquired the trick of </p><p>being hard, steely, suggesting relentlessness, </p><p>stern and quick. Tall, lean-bodied, with </p><p>big calloused hands, as brown as an Indian, </p><p>hair and eyes were uncompromisingly black. </p><p>He belonged to the Southwestern wastes. </p><p> These things she noted, and that his face</p><p>looked drawn and weary, that about his left </p><p>hand was tied a handkerchief, hinting at a </p><p>minor cut, that his horse looked as travel- </p><p>worn as himself. </p><p> “One doesn’t see strangers often around</p><p>San Juan,” he explained. “As for a girl— </p><p>well, I never made a mistake like this be- </p><p>fore. I’ll have to look out.” </p><p> The muscles of the tired face softened a</p><p>little, into his eyes came a quick light that </p><p>was good to see, for an instant masking their </p><p>habitual sternness. </p><p> “If you’ll excuse me again, and if you</p><p>don’t know a whole lot about this country </p><p>—” he paused to measure her sweepingly, </p><p>seemed satisfied and concluded—“I wouldn’t </p><p>go out all alone like this; especially after </p><p>sundown. We’re a rather tough lot, you</p><p>know. Good-by.” </p><p> He had lifted his hat again, loosened his</p><p>horse’s reins and passed by her. Just as she </p><p>had expected, just as she had desired. </p><p>And yet, with his dusty back turned upon </p><p>her she experienced a sudden return of her </p><p>loneliness. Would she ever look into the </p><p>eyes of a friend again? Could she ever ac- </p><p>tually accomplish what she had set out to </p><p>accomplish; make San Juan a home? </p><p> Her eyes followed him, frankly admiring</p><p>now; so she might have looked at any other </p><p>of nature’s triumphant creations. Then, </p><p>before he had gone a score of yards, she saw </p><p>how a little tightening of his horse’s reins </p><p>had brought the big brute down from a </p><p>swinging gallop to a dead standstill. The </p><p>bell was tolling again. </p><p> Again he was calling to her, again, swing-</p><p>ing about, he had ridden to her side. And </p><p>his voice now, like his eyes, was ominously </p><p>stem. </p><p> “Who is it?” he demanded.</p><p> “I don’t know,” she told him, marvelling</p><p>at the look on his face. His emotion was </p><p>purely one of anger, mounting anger that a </p><p>man was dead! “The man who rings the </p><p>bells told me that he thought it must be a </p><p>sheepman from Las Palmas. He went to </p><p>see—I didn’t wait.” </p><p> Nor did this man wait now. Again he</p><p>had wheeled; now he was racing along the </p><p>arroyo, urging a tired horse that he might </p><p>lose no unnecessary handful of moments. </p><p>And as he went she heard him curse savagely </p><p>under his breath and knew that he had for- </p><p>gotten her in the thoughts which had been </p><p>released by the dull booming of a bell. </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>IN THE bar at the Casa Blanca, </p><p>a long wide room, low-ceilinged and </p><p>with cool, sprinkled floor a score or </p><p>more men had congregated. For the most </p><p>part they were silent, content to look at the </p><p>signs left by the recent shooting and to have </p><p>what scraps of explanation were vouch- </p><p>safed them. And these were meager </p><p>enough. The man who had done the shoot- </p><p>ing was sullen and self-contained. The </p><p>dead man—it was the sheepman from</p><p>Las Palmas—lay in an adjoining card- </p><p>room, stark under the blanket which the </p><p>large hands of Jim Galloway had drawn over </p><p>him. </p><p> When the clatter of hoofs rang out in the</p><p>street a couple of men went to the door. </p><p> “It is the sheriff,” they said, “coming</p><p>back.” </p><p> Roderick Norton entering swiftly, his</p><p>spurs dragging and jangling, swept the faces </p><p>in the room with eyes which had in them </p><p>none of that human glint of good-will which </p><p>the girl at the arroyo had glimpsed in them. </p><p>Again they were steely, angry, bespeaking </p><p>both threat and suspicion. </p><p>The Bells of San Juan </p><p>47 </p><p> “Who is it this time?” he demanded,</p><p>sharply. </p><p> “Bisbee, from Las Palmas,” they told him.</p><p>“Who did it?” came the quick question. </p><p>And then, before an answer could come, his </p><p>voice ringing with the anger in it—• </p><p>“Antone or ‘Kid’ Rickard? Which one?” </p><p>He had shifted his rifle so that it was </p><p>caught up under his left arm. His right </p><p>hand, frank and unhidden, rested upon the </p><p>butt of the heavy-caliber revolver sagging </p><p>from his belt. Standing just within the </p><p>room he had stepped to one side of the door- </p><p>way so that the wall was at his back. </p><p> “It was the Kid,” some one answered.</p><p>And was continuing, “He says it was self- </p><p>defense-” </p><p> Norton cut in bluntly-</p><p>•	“Was Gallowav here when it happened?”</p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “Where’s Galloway now?”</p><p> It was noteworthy that he asked for Jim</p><p>Galloway rather than for Kid Rickard. </p><p> “In there,” they told him, indicating a</p><p>second card-room adjoining that in which </p><p>the Las Palmas sheepman lay. Rod Nor- </p><p>ton, again glancing sharply across the faces </p><p>confronting him, went to the closed door and </p><p>set his hand to the knob. But Jim Gallo- </p><p>way having desired privacy just now had </p><p>locked the door. Norton struck it sharply, </p><p>commanding: </p><p> “Open up, Galloway. It’s Norton.”</p><p>There came the low mutter of a voice </p><p>hasty and with the quality of stern exhorta- </p><p>tion, the snap of the lock and the door was </p><p>jerked open. Norton’s eyes, probing into </p><p>every square foot of the chamber, took stock </p><p>of Jim Galloway and beyond him of Kid </p><p>Rickard, slouching forward in a chair and </p><p>rolling a cigaret. </p><p> “Hello, Norton,” said Galloway, tone-</p><p>lessly. “Glad you showed up. There’s </p><p>been trouble.” </p><p> A heavy man above the waist-line, thick-</p><p>shouldered with large head and bull throat, </p><p>his muscular torso tapered down to clean- </p><p>lined hips, his legs of no greater girth than </p><p>those of the lean-bodied man confronting </p><p>him, his feet small in glove-fitting boots. </p><p>His eyes, prominent and full and a clear </p><p>brown, were a shade too innocent. Chin, </p><p>jaw and mouth, the latter full-lipped, were </p><p>those of strength, smashing power and a </p><p>natural cruelty. He was the one man to be </p><p>found in San Juan who was dressed as the </p><p>rather fastidiously inclined business men </p><p>dress in the cities. </p><p> “Another man down, Galloway,” said</p><p>Norton, with an ominous sternness. “And </p><p>in your place. How long do you think that </p><p>you can keep out from under?” </p><p> His meaning was plain enough; the men</p><p>behind him in the barroom listened in atti- </p><p>tudes which, varying in other matters, were </p><p>alike in their tenseness. Galloway how- </p><p>ever, staring stonily with eyes not unlike </p><p>polished agate so cold and steady were </p><p>they, gave no sign of taking offense. </p><p> “You and I never were friends, Rod</p><p>Norton,” he said, unmoved. “Still that’s </p><p>no reason you should jump me for trouble. </p><p>Answering your question, I expect to keep </p><p>out from under just as long as two things </p><p>remain as they are: first, as long as I play </p><p>the game square and in the open; next, as </p><p>long as an overgrown boy holds down the </p><p>job of sheriff in San Juan.” </p><p> In Norton’s eyes was blazing hatred, in</p><p>Galloway’s mere steady, unwinking bold- </p><p>ness. </p><p> “You saw the killing?” the sheriff asked,</p><p>curtly. </p><p> “Yes,” said Galloway.</p><p> “The Kid there did it?”</p><p> For the first time the man sloucliing for-</p><p>ward in the chair lifted his head. Had a </p><p>stranger looked in at that moment, curious </p><p>to see him who has just committed homi- </p><p>cide—or murder—he must have experienced </p><p>a positive shock. Sullen-eyed, sullen-lip- </p><p>ped, the man-killer could not yet have seen </p><p>the last of his teens. A thin wisp of straw-</p><p>colored hair across a low, atavistic forehead, </p><p>unhealthy, yellowish skin, with pale, lack- </p><p>luster, faded blue eyes, he looked evil and </p><p>vicious and cruel. </p><p> One looking from him to Jim Galloway</p><p>would have suspected that one could be as </p><p>inhuman as the other but with the difference </p><p>that that which was but means to an end </p><p>with Galloway would be end in itself to </p><p>Kid Rickard. Something of the primal </p><p>savage shone in the pale fires of his eyes. </p><p> “Yes,” retorted the Kid, his surly voice</p><p>little better than a snarl. “I got him and be </p><p>damned to him!” </p><p> “Bad luck cursing a dead man, Rickard,”</p><p>said Norton, coldly. “What did you kill </p><p>him for?” </p><p> Kid Rickard’s tongue ran back and forth</p><p>between his colorless lips before he replied. </p><p> “He tried to get me first,” he said,</p><p>defiantly. </p><p>48 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>“Who saw the shooting?” </p><p>“Jim Galloway. And Antone.” </p><p> Rod Norton grunted his disgust with the</p><p> situation.</p><p>“Give me your gun,” he commanded, </p><p>tersely. </p><p>THE KID frowned. Galloway </p><p>cleared his throat. Rickard’s eyes </p><p>went to him swiftly. Then he got </p><p>to his feet, jerked a thirty-eight caliber </p><p>revolver from the hip-pocket of his overalls </p><p>and held it out, surrendering it reluctantly. </p><p>Norton “broke” it, ejecting the cartridges </p><p>into his palm. Not an empty shell among </p><p>them; the Kid had slipped in a fresh shell for </p><p>every exploded one. </p><p>“How many times did you shoot?” </p><p>“I don’t know. Two or three, I guess. </p><p>-it, do you imagine a man counts ’em?” </p><p>“What were you and Galloway doing </p><p>alone in here with the door locked?” </p><p>Galloway cut in sharply- </p><p> “I didn’t want any more trouble; I was</p><p>afraid somebody-” </p><p> “Shut up, will you?” cried the sheriff</p><p> fiercely. “I’ll give you all the chance to</p><p> talk you want pretty soon. Answer me,</p><p> Rickard.”</p><p> “I told him to lock me up somewhere until</p><p> you or Tom Cutter come,” said the Kid,</p><p> slowly. “I was afraid somebody might</p><p> jump me for what I done. I didn’t want</p><p> no more trouble.”</p><p>Norton turned briefly to the crowded </p><p>room behind him. </p><p>“Anybody know where Cutter is?” he </p><p>asked. </p><p>It appeared that every one knew. Tom </p><p>Cutter, Rod Norton’s deputy, had gone in</p><p>the early morning to Mesa Verde, and would </p><p>probably return in the cool of the evening. </p><p>Frowning, Norton made the best of the </p><p>situation and to gain his purpose called four </p><p>men out of the crowd. </p><p> “I want you boys to do me a favor,” he</p><p> said. “Antone, come here.”</p><p> The short, squat half-breed standing be-</p><p> hind the bar lifted his heavy black brows,</p><p> demanding:</p><p>“F porque? What am I to do?” </p><p>“As you are told,” Norton snapped at </p><p>him. “Benny, you and Dick walk down </p><p>the street with Antone; you other boys walk </p><p>down the other way with Rickard. If they </p><p>haven’t had all the chance to talk together </p><p>already that they want don’t give them any </p><p>more opportunity. Step up, Rickard.” </p><p> The Kid sulked but under the look the</p><p>sheriff turned on him he came forward and </p><p>went out of the door, his whole attitude re- </p><p>maining one of defiance. Antone, his swart </p><p>face as expressionless as a piece of ma- </p><p>hogany, hesitated, glanced at Galloway, </p><p>shrugged and did as Rickard had done, going </p><p>out between his two guards. The men </p><p>remaining in the barroom were watching </p><p>their sheriff expectantly. He swung about </p><p>upon Galloway. </p><p> “Now,” he said quickly, “who fired the</p><p>first shot, Galloway?” </p><p> Galloway smiled, went to his bar, poured</p><p>himself a glass of whisky and standing there, </p><p>the glass twisting slowly in his fingers, </p><p>stared back innocently at his interrogator. </p><p> “Trying the case already, Judge Nor-</p><p>ton?” he inquired equably. </p><p>“Will you answer?” Norton said coolly. </p><p>“Sure.” Galloway kept his look steady </p><p>upon the sheriff’s and into the innocence of </p><p>his eyes there came a veiled insolence. </p><p>“Bisbee shot first.” </p><p> “Where was he standing?”</p><p> Galloway pointed.</p><p> “Right there.”</p><p> The spot indicated was about three or</p><p>four feet from where Norton stood, near the </p><p>second card-room door. </p><p> “Where was the Kid?”</p><p> “Over there.” Again Galloway pointed.</p><p>“Clean across the room, over by where the </p><p>chair is tumbled over against the table.” </p><p>“How many times did Bisbee shoot?” </p><p>Galloway seemed to be trying to remem- </p><p>ber. He drank his whisky slowly, reached </p><p>over the bar for a cigar upon the shelf under </p><p>it, and answered: </p><p> “Twice or three times.”</p><p> “How many times did Rickard shoot?”</p><p>“I’m not sure. I’d say about the same; </p><p>two or three times.” </p><p> “Where was Antone standing?”</p><p> “Behind the bar; down at the far end,</p><p>nearest the door.” </p><p> “Where were you?”</p><p> “Leaning against the bar, talking to</p><p>Antone.” </p><p> “What were you talking about?”</p><p> This question came quicker, sharper than</p><p>the others, as though calculated to startle </p><p>Galloway into a quick answer. But the </p><p>proprietor of the Casa Blanca was lighting </p><p>his cigar and took his time. When he </p><p>looked up his eyes told Norton that he had </p><p>The Bells of San Juan </p><p>49 </p><p> understood any danger which might lie</p><p>under a question so simple in the seeming. </p><p>His eyes were smiling contemptuously, but </p><p>there was a faint flush in his cheeks. </p><p> “I don’t remember,” he replied at last.</p><p>“Some trifle. The shooting, coming sud- </p><p>denly that way-” </p><p> “What started the ruction?”</p><p> “Bisbee had been drinking a little. He</p><p>seemed to be in the devil’s own temper. </p><p>He had asked the Kid to have a drink with </p><p>him and Rickard refused. He had his </p><p>drink alone and then invited the Kid again. </p><p>Rickard told him to go to hell. Bisbee </p><p>started to walk across the room as though he </p><p>was going to the card-room. Then he </p><p>grabbed his gun and whirled around and </p><p>started shooting.” </p><p> “Missing every time, of course?”</p><p> Galloway nodded.</p><p> “You’ll remember I said he was carrying</p><p>enough of a load to make his aim bad.” </p><p>Norton asked half a dozen further ques- </p><p>tions and then said abruptly: </p><p> “That’s all. As you go out will you tell</p><p>the boys to send Antone in?” </p><p> Again a hint of color crept slowly, dully</p><p>into Galloway’s cheeks. </p><p> “You’re going pretty far, Rod Norton,”</p><p>he said, tonelessly. </p><p> “You’re-right I am!” cried Norton,</p><p>ringingly. “And I am going a lot further, </p><p>Jim Galloway, before I get through and you </p><p>can bet all of your blue chips on it. I want </p><p>Antone in here and I want you outside! </p><p>Do I get what I want or not?” </p><p> Galloway stood motionless, his cigar</p><p>clamped tight in his big square teeth. </p><p>Then he shrugged and went to the door. </p><p> “If I am standing a good deal off of you,”</p><p>he muttered, hanging on his heel just before </p><p>he passed out, “it’s because I am as strong </p><p>as any man in the county to see the law</p><p>brought into San Juan. And,” for the first </p><p>time yielding outwardly to a display of the </p><p>emotion riding him, he spat out venomously </p><p>and tauntingly, “and we’d have had the </p><p>law here long ago had we had a couple of </p><p>men in the boots of the Nortons, father and </p><p>son!” </p><p> Rod Norton’s face went a flaming red</p><p>with anger, his hand grew white upon the </p><p>butt of the gun at his side. </p><p> “Some day, Jim Galloway,” he said</p><p>steadily, “I’ll get you just as sure as you </p><p>got Billy Norton!” </p><p> Galloway laughed and went out.</p><p>jllllll TO ANTONE Norton put the </p><p>j|||§|| identical questions he had asked of </p><p>Galloway, receiving virtually the </p><p>same replies. Seeking the one opportunity </p><p>suggesting itself into tricking the bartender </p><p>he asked at the end. </p><p> “Just before the shooting, when you and</p><p>Galloway were talking and he told you that </p><p>Bisbee was looking for trouble, why weren’t </p><p>you ready to grab him when he went for his </p><p>gun?” </p><p> Antone was giving his replies as guardedly</p><p>as Galloway had done. He took his time </p><p>now. </p><p> “Because,” he began finally, “I do not be-</p><p>lief when Senor Galloway speak that-” </p><p> His eyes had been roving from Norton’s,*</p><p>going here and there about the room. Sud- </p><p>denly a startled look came into them and he </p><p>snapped his mouth shut. </p><p> “Go on,” prompted the sheriff.</p><p> “I don’t remember,” grunted Antone.</p><p>“I forget what Senor Galloway say, what I </p><p>say. Bisbee say, ‘Have a drink.’ The Kid </p><p>say, ‘Go to hell.’ Bisbee shoot, one, two, </p><p>three, like that. I forget what we talk </p><p>about.” </p><p> Norton turned slowly and looked whither</p><p>Antone had been looking when he cut his </p><p>own words off so sharply. The man upon </p><p>whom his eyes rested longest was a creased- </p><p>face Mexican, Vidal Nunez, who stood head- </p><p>down now making a cigaret.</p><p> “That’s all, Antone,” Norton said. “Send</p><p>the Kid in.” </p><p> The Kid came, still sullen but swaggering</p><p>a little, his hat cocked jauntily to one </p><p>side, the yellow wisp of hair in his faded </p><p>eyes. And he, in turn questioned, gave </p><p>such answers as the two had given before </p><p>him. </p><p> For the first time now the sheriff, stepping</p><p>across the room, looked for such evidence as </p><p>flying lead might have left for him. In the </p><p>wall just behind the spot where Bisbee had </p><p>stood were two bullet-holes. Going to the </p><p>far end of the room where the chair leaned </p><p>against the table, he found that a pane of </p><p>glass in the window opening upon the street </p><p>had been broken. There were no bullet- </p><p>marks upon wall or woodwork. </p><p> “Bisbee shot two or three times did he?”</p><p>he cried, wheeling on the Kid. “And missed </p><p>every time? And all the bullets went </p><p>through the one hole in the window, I sup- </p><p>pose?” </p><p> The Kid shrugged insolently.</p><p>50 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>“I didn’t watch ’em,” he returned, briefly. </p><p>Galloway and Antone were allowed to </p><p>come again into the room and of Galloway, </p><p>quite as though no hot word had passed be- </p><p>tween them, Norton asked quietly: </p><p> “Bisbee had a lot of money on him.</p><p>What happened to it?” </p><p> “In there.” Galloway nodded toward</p><p>the card-room whose door had remained </p><p>closed. “In his pocket.” </p><p> A few of the morbid followed as he went</p><p>into the little room. Most of the men had </p><p>already seen and had no further curiosity. </p><p>Norton drew the blanket away, noted the </p><p>wounds, three of them, two at the base of </p><p>the throat and one just above the left eye. </p><p>Then, going through the sheepman’s pock- </p><p>ets, he brought out a handful of coins. A </p><p>few gold, most of them silver dollars and </p><p>half-dollars, in all a little over fifty dollars. </p><p> The dead man lay across two tables</p><p>drawn up together, his booted feet sticking </p><p>out stolidly beyond the bed, still too short to </p><p>accommodate his length of body. Nor- </p><p>ton’s eyes rested on the man’s boots longer </p><p>than upon the cold face. Then, stepping </p><p>back to the door so that all in the barroom </p><p>might catch the significance of his words he </p><p>said sharply: </p><p> “How many men of you know where Bis-</p><p>bee always carried his money when he was </p><p>on his way to bank?” </p><p> “In his boots!” answered two voices to-</p><p>gether. </p><p> “Come this way, boys. Take a look at</p><p>his boots, will you?” </p><p> And as they crowded about the table,</p><p>sensing some new development, Galloway </p><p>pushing well to the fore, Norton’s vibrant </p><p>voice rang out: </p><p> “It was a clean job getting him, and a</p><p>clean job telling the story of how it hap- </p><p>pened. But there wasn’t over much time </p><p>and in the rush—tell me, Jim Galloway, </p><p>how does it happen that the right boot is on </p><p>the left foot!”</p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>ROD NORTON made no arrest. </p><p>Leaving the card-room abruptly he </p><p>signaled to Julius Struve, the </p><p>heavy-featured hotel-keeper, to follow him. </p><p>In the morning Struve, in his official capac- </p><p>ity as coroner, would demand a verdict. </p><p>Having long been in strong sympathy with </p><p>the sheriff he was to be looked to now for a </p><p>frank prediction of the inquest’s result. </p><p>And, very thoughtful about it all, he gravely </p><p>agreed with Norton; the coroner’s jury, tak- </p><p>ing the evidence offered by Jim Galloway, </p><p>Kid Rickard and Antone, would bring in a </p><p>verdict of justifiable homicide. </p><p> “Later on we’ll get ’em, Roddy—mebbe,”</p><p>he said finally. “But not now. If you </p><p>pulled the Kid it would just be runnin’ up </p><p>the county expense an’ all for nothin’.” </p><p> The sheriff left him in silence and leading</p><p>his horse went the few steps to the hotel. </p><p>Ignacio Chavez appearing opportunely, </p><p>Norton gave his animal into the breed’s cus- </p><p>tody; Ignacio, accustomed to doing odd </p><p>jobs for el Senor Roderico Nortone, and to </p><p>the occasional half-dollars resulting from </p><p>such transactions, led the big gray away </p><p>while the sheriff entered the hotel. It had </p><p>been a day of hard riding and scanty meals </p><p>and he was hungry. </p><p> Bright and new and conspicuous, a little</p><p>gold-lettered sign at Struve’s doorway </p><p>caught his eye and caused him to remember </p><p>the wounded left hand which had been pain- </p><p>ing him considerably through the long hot </p><p>day. The sign bore the name of Dr. V. D. </p><p>Page with the words “Physician and Sur- </p><p>geon”; in blue pencilled letters upon the </p><p>practitioner’s card, affixed to the brass chain </p><p>suspending the sign, were the further </p><p>words- </p><p>Room 5, Struve’s Hotel. </p><p> The sheriff went through the empty</p><p>dining-room where he left his rifle standing </p><p>in a comer, washed his face and hands in a </p><p>basin on the back porch, removing the </p><p>handkerchief from his left hand, and, look- </p><p>ing in upon the Indian cook to say that he </p><p>would be ready to eat in five minutes, went </p><p>to Room 5. It was at the front of -the</p><p>building, upon the ground floor, and opened </p><p>almost immediately when he rapped. Con- </p><p>fronting him, her own hands just being </p><p>dried upon a small linen towel, was the girl </p><p>he had encountered at the arroyo. He </p><p>lifted his hat to her, looked beyond her </p><p>and said simply: </p><p> “I was looking for Dr. Page. Is he in</p><p>now?” </p><p> “Yes,” she told him gravely. “Come in,</p><p>please.” </p><p> He stepped across the threshold, his eyes</p><p>trained to quick observation of details tak- </p><p>ing in all there was to be seen at a glance. </p><p>The room showed all signs of a fresh un- </p><p>The Bells of San Juan </p><p>51 </p><p>packing, the one table and two chairs piled </p><p>high with odds and ends. For the most </p><p>part the miscellany consisted of big, </p><p>fat books, bundles of towels and fresh </p><p>white napkins, stoppered bottles of vari- </p><p>colored contents and black leather cases, no </p><p>doubt containing a surgeon’s instruments. </p><p>Through an open door giving entrance to </p><p>the adjoining room he noted further signs of </p><p>unpacking with a marked difference in the </p><p>character of the litter; the girl stepped </p><p>quickly to this door, shutting out the vision </p><p>of a helter-skelter of feminine apparel. </p><p> “It is your hand?” she asked, as in most</p><p>thoroughly matter-of-fact fashion she put </p><p>out her own for it. “Let me see it.” </p><p> But for a moment he bestowed upon her</p><p>merely a slow look of question. </p><p> “You don’t mean that you are Dr.</p><p>Page?” he asked. Then, believing that he </p><p>understood— “You’re the nurse?” </p><p> “Is a physician’s life likely to be so filled</p><p>with his duties that he must bring a nurse </p><p>with him to San Juan?” she countered. </p><p>“Yes, I am Dr. Page.” </p><p> He noted that she was as defiant about the</p><p>matter as the Kid had been about the killing </p><p>of Bisbee of Las Palmas; plainly she had </p><p>foreseen that the type of man animal in- </p><p>habiting this corner of the out-of-the-way </p><p>world would be likely to wonder at her </p><p>hardihood and, perhaps, to jeer. </p><p> “I just got here today,” she explained</p><p>in the same matter-of-fact way. “Conse- </p><p>quently you will pardon the looks of things. </p><p>But I am one of the kind that believes in </p><p>hanging out a shingle first, getting details </p><p>arranged next. Now may I see the hand?” </p><p>“It’s hardly anything.” He lifted it now, </p><p>holding it out in front of him. “Just a </p><p>little cut, you know. But it’s showing </p><p>signs of infection. A little antiseptic-” </p><p> She had already taken his fingers into</p><p>hers, was bending over the wound. He </p><p>noted two things, now: what strong hands </p><p>she had, shapely, with sensitive fingers all </p><p>ignorant of rings; how richly alive and</p><p>warmly colored her hair was, full of little </p><p>waves and curls. </p><p> She had nothing to say while she treated</p><p>him. Over an alcohol lamp she heated </p><p>some water; in a bowl, brought from the ad- </p><p>joining room, she cleansed the hand thor- </p><p>oughly. Then the application of the final </p><p>antiseptic, a bit of absorbent cotton, a </p><p>winding of surgeon’s tape about a bit of </p><p>gauze, and the thing was done. Only at the </p><p>end did she say— </p><p>“It’s a peculiar cut—not a knife-cut, is </p><p>it?” </p><p>“No,” he answered humorously. “Did it </p><p>on a piece of lead. 1 How much is it, Doctor?” </p><p> “Two dollars,” she told him, again busied</p><p>with the drying of her own hands. “Better </p><p>let me look at it again in the morning if it </p><p>pains you any.” </p><p> He laid two silver dollars in her palm,</p><p>hesitated a moment and then went out. </p><p> “She’s got the nerve,” was his thoughtful</p><p>estimate as he went to his corner table in </p><p>the dining-room, “ftut I don’t believe she </p><p>is going to last long in San Juan. Funny </p><p>she should come to a place like this, anyhow. </p><p>Wonder what the V stands for?” </p><p> At any rate the hand had been skilfully</p><p>treated and bandaged; he nodded at it </p><p>approvingly. Then, with his meal set be- </p><p>fore him, he divided his thoughts pretty </p><p>evenly between it and the recent shooting at </p><p>the Casa Blanca. The sense was strong </p><p>upon him as it had been many a time before </p><p>that before very long either Rod Norton or </p><p>Jim Galloway would lie as the sheepman </p><p>from Las Palmas was lying, while the other </p><p>might watch his sunrises and sunsets with </p><p>a strange, new emotion of security. </p><p> The sheriff, manifesting an appetite</p><p>which gave color to the suspicion that he </p><p>had not eaten for a matter of twelve hours, </p><p>was beginning his meal when the newest </p><p>stranger in San Juan came into the dining- </p><p>room. She had had time to finish bathing </p><p>her hands and face, had arranged her lus- </p><p>trous copper-brown hair becomingly, and </p><p>looked fresh and cool and pretty. Norton</p><p>approved of her with his keen eyes while he </p><p>watched her go to her place at a table </p><p>across the room. As she sat down, giving </p><p>no sign of having noted him, her back to- </p><p>ward him, he continued to observe and to </p><p>admire her lithe, perfect figure and the </p><p>strong, sensitive hands busied with her </p><p>napkin. </p><p> A slovenly, half-grown Indian girl, Anita,</p><p>the cook’s daughter, came in from the </p><p>kitchen, directed the slumbrous eyes of her </p><p>race upon the sheriff who fitted well in a </p><p>woman’s eye, and went to serve the single </p><p>other late diner. Now Norton caught a </p><p>fleeting view of V. D. Page’s throat and </p><p>cheek as she turned slightly in speaking </p><p>with Anita. The serving-maid withdrew </p><p>and as she went out Norton rose to his feet </p><p>and crossed the room to the far table. </p><p>52 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “May I bring my things over and eat</p><p>with you?” he asked when he stood looking </p><p>down on her and she had lifted her eyes curi- </p><p>ously to his. “If you’ve come to stay you </p><p>can’t go on forever not knowing anybody </p><p>here, you know. Since you’ve got to know </p><p>us sooner or later why not begin to get ac- </p><p>quainted? Here and now and with me? </p><p>I’m Roderick Norton.” </p><p> One must have had far less discernment</p><p>than she not to have felt instinctively that </p><p>the great bulk of human conventions would </p><p>shrivel and vanish before they could cross </p><p>this far across the desert lands. Besides </p><p>the man standing over her looked straight </p><p>and honestly into her eyes and for a little </p><p>she glimpsed again the youth of him veiled </p><p>by the sternness his life had set into his soul </p><p>and upon his face. </p><p> “It is kind of you to have pity upon me in</p><p>my isolation,” she answered lightly and </p><p>without hesitation. “And, to tell the truth, </p><p>I never was so terribly lonesome in all my </p><p>life.” </p><p> He made two trips back and forth to bring</p><p>his plate and coffee cup and auxiliary sauce </p><p>dishes and plated silver while she wondered </p><p>idly that he did not instruct the Indian girl </p><p>to perform the service for him. Even then </p><p>she half-formulated the thought that it was </p><p>a much more natural thing for this man to </p><p>do for himself what he wanted done than </p><p>for him to sit down to be waited upon. </p><p>A small matter, no doubt; but then moun- </p><p>tains are made up of small particles and </p><p>character of just such small characteristics </p><p>as this. </p><p>DURING the half-hour which </p><p>they spent together over their meal </p><p>they got to know each other rather </p><p>better than chance acquaintances are likely </p><p>to do in so brief a time. For from the mo- </p><p>ment of Norton’s coming over to her table </p><p>the bars were fortuitously down between </p><p>them. She was plainly eager to supplement </p><p>Ignacio Chavez’s information of la genie of </p><p>San Juan and its surrounding country, </p><p>evincing a curiosity which he readily under- </p><p>stood to be based upon the necessities of her </p><p>profession. </p><p> In return for all that he told her she</p><p>sketchily spoke of her own plans, very </p><p>vague plans, to be sure, she admitted with </p><p>one of her quick, gay smiles. She had come </p><p>prepared to accept what she found; she was </p><p>playing no game of hide and seek with her </p><p>destiny, but had come out thus far from the </p><p>former limits of her existence to meet life </p><p>half-way, hoping to do good for others, a </p><p>little imperiously determined to achieve </p><p>her own measure of success and happiness. </p><p> From the beginning each was ready, per-</p><p>haps more than ready, to like the other. </p><p>Her eyes, whether they smiled or grew sud- </p><p>denly grave, pleased him; always were they </p><p>fearless. He sensed that beneath the exter- </p><p>nal soft beauty of a very lovely young </p><p>woman there was a spirit of hardihood in </p><p>every sense worthy of the success which she </p><p>had come out bare-handed to make for </p><p>herself, and in the estimation of Rod </p><p>Norton no quality stood higher than a </p><p>superb independence. </p><p> On her part, there was first a definite</p><p>surprise, then a glow of satisfaction that in </p><p>this virile arm of the law there was nothing </p><p>of the blusterer. She set him down as a </p><p>quiet gentleman first, as a sheriff next. </p><p>She enjoyed his low, good-humored laugh </p><p>and laughed back with him, even while she </p><p>experienced again the unaccustomed thrill </p><p>at the sheer physical bigness of him, the </p><p>essentially masculine strength of a hardy </p><p>son of the Southwestern outdoors. </p><p> Not once had he referred to the affair at</p><p>the Casa Blanca or to his part in it; not a </p><p>question did she ask him concerning it. </p><p>He told himself that so utterly human, so </p><p>perfectly feminine a being as she must be </p><p>burning with curiosity; she marvelled that </p><p>he could think, speak of anything else. </p><p>When they rose together from the table </p><p>they were alike prepared, should circum- </p><p>stance so direct, to be friends. </p><p> She was going now to call upon the</p><p>Engles. She had told him that she had a </p><p>letter to Mrs. Engle from a common friend </p><p>in Richmond. </p><p> “I don’t want to appear to be riding too</p><p>hard on your trail,” he smiled at her. </p><p>“But I was planning dropping in on the </p><p>Engles myself this evening. They’re</p><p>friends of mine, you know.” </p><p> She laughed and, as they left the hotel,</p><p>propounded a riddle for him to answer: </p><p>should Mr. Norton introduce her to Mrs. </p><p>Engle so that she might present her letter, </p><p>or, after the letter was presented, should </p><p>Mrs. Engle introduce her to Mr. Norton? </p><p> It did not suggest itself to her until they</p><p>had passed from the street, through the </p><p>cottonwoods and into the splendid living- </p><p>room of the Engle home, that her escort was </p><p>The Bells of San Juan </p><p>53 </p><p>not dressed as she had imagined all civilized </p><p>mankind dressed for a call. Walking </p><p>through the primitive town his boots and </p><p>soft shirt and travel-soiled hat had been in </p><p>too perfect keeping with the environment </p><p>for her to be more than pleasurably con- </p><p>scious of them. At the Engle’s, however, </p><p>his garb struck her for a moment of the first </p><p>shock of contrast, as almost grotesquely out </p><p>of place. </p><p> At the broad front door Norton had</p><p>rapped. The desultory striking of a piano’s </p><p>keys ceased abruptly, a girl’s voice crying </p><p>eagerly, “It’s Roddy!” hinted at the iden- </p><p>tity of the listless player; a door within </p><p>flung open flooded the broad entrance hall </p><p>with light. And then the outer door </p><p>framed banker Engle’s daughter, fair- </p><p>haired, fair-skinned, fluffy-skirted, her eyes </p><p>bright with unhidden expectation, her two </p><p>hands held out offering themselves in dou- </p><p>bled greetings. But, having seen the unex- </p><p>pected guest at the sheriff’s side, the bright- </p><p>haired girl paused for a brief moment of </p><p>uncertainty upon the threshold, her hands </p><p>falling to her sides. </p><p> “Hello, Florrie,” Norton was saying,</p><p>quietly. “I have brought a caller for your </p><p>mother. Miss Engle, Miss Page.” </p><p> “How do you do, Miss Page?” Florrie'</p><p>replied, regaining her poise and giving one of </p><p>her hands to each of the callers, the abandon </p><p>of her first appearance gone in a flash to be </p><p>replaced by a vague hint of stiffness. </p><p>“Mama will be so glad to see you. Do </p><p>come in.” </p><p> She turned and led the way down the</p><p>wide, deep hall and into the living-room, a </p><p>chamber which boldly defied one to remem- </p><p>ber that he was still upon the rim of the </p><p>desert. In one swift glance the newcomer </p><p>to San Juan was offered a picture in which </p><p>the tall, carelessly-clad form of the sheriff </p><p>became incongruous; she wondered that he </p><p>remained at his ease as he so obviously </p><p>did. </p><p> Yonder was a grand piano, a silver-chased</p><p>vase upon a wall bracket over it holding </p><p>three long-stemmed, red roses; a heavy, </p><p>massive-topped table strewn comfortably</p><p>and invitingly with books and magazines; </p><p>an exquisite rug and one painting upon the </p><p>far wall, an original seascape suggestive of </p><p>Waugh at his best; excellent, leather- </p><p>upholstered chairs luxuriously inviting and </p><p>at once homelike and rich. Just rising </p><p>from one of these chairs drawn up to the </p><p>table reading-lamp, a book still in his hand, </p><p>was Mr. Engle, while Mrs. Engle, in lavender, </p><p>as fair as her daughter, just beginning to </p><p>grow stout, came forward smilingly. </p><p> “Back again, Roddy?”</p><p> She gave him a plump hand, patted his</p><p>lean brown fingers after her motherly fash- </p><p>ion, and came to where the girl had stopped </p><p>just within the door. </p><p> “Virginia Page, aren’t you? As if any</p><p>one in the world would have to tell me who </p><p>you were! You are your mother all over, </p><p>child; did you know it? Oh, kiss me, kiss </p><p>me, my dear, for your mother’s sake, and </p><p>save your handshakes for strangers.” </p><p>Virginia, taken utterly by surprise as </p><p>Mrs. Engle’s arms closed warmly about her, </p><p>grew rosy with pleasure; the dreary loneli- </p><p>ness of a long day was wiped out with a </p><p>kiss and a hug. </p><p> “I didn’t know—” she began haltingly,</p><p>only to be cut short by Mrs. Engle crying </p><p>to her husband: </p><p> “It’s Virginia Page, John. Wouldn’t you</p><p>have known her anywhere?” </p><p> John Engle, courteous, urbane, a pleas-</p><p>ant-featured man with grave, kindly eyes </p><p>and a rather large, firm-lipped mouth nod- </p><p>ded to Norton and gave Virginia his hand </p><p>cordially. </p><p> “I must be satisfied with a handshake,</p><p>Miss Page,” he said in a deep, pleasant </p><p>voice, “but I refuse to be a mere stranger. </p><p>We are immensely glad to have you with us. </p><p>Mother, can’t you see we have most thor- </p><p>oughly mystified her; swooping down upon </p><p>her like this without giving her an inkling </p><p>of how and why we expected her?” </p><p> Roderick Norton and Florrie Engle had</p><p>drawn a little apart; Virginia, with her back </p><p>tc\them during the greeting of Mrs. and Mr. </p><p>Engle had no way of knowing whether the</p><p>withdrawal had been .by mutually sponta- </p><p>neous desire or whether the initiative had </p><p>been the sheriff’s or Miss Engle’s. Not that </p><p>it mattered or concerned her in any </p><p>slightest particular. . . . </p><p> In her hand was the note of introduction</p><p>she had brought from Mrs. Seth Morgan; </p><p>evidently both its services and those of </p><p>Roderick Norton might be dispensed with </p><p>in the matter of her being presented. </p><p> “Of course,” Mrs. Engle was saying.</p><p>An arm about the girl’s slim waist, she drew </p><p>her to a big leather couch and, still holding </p><p>her hand, sat down beside her. “Marian </p><p>never does things by halves, my dear; you </p><p>54 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>know that, don’t you? That’s a letter she </p><p>gave you for me? Well, she wrote me an- </p><p>other, so I know all about you. And, if </p><p>you are willing to accept the relationship </p><p>with out-of-the-world folks, we’re sort of </p><p>cousins!” </p><p> Virginia Page flushed vividly. She had</p><p>known all along that her mother had been a </p><p>distant relative of Mrs. Engle, but she had </p><p>had no desire, no thought even, of employ- </p><p>ing the very faint tie as a sort of insistent </p><p>argument for being accepted by the banker’s </p><p>family. She did not care to come here like </p><p>the proverbial poor relation. </p><p> “You are very kind,” she said quietly, her</p><p>lips smiling while her eyes were grave. </p><p>“But I don’t want you to feel that I have </p><p>been building on the fact of kinship; I just </p><p>wanted to be friends if you liked me, not </p><p>because you felt it your duty-” </p><p> Engle, who had come dragging his chair</p><p>after him, to join them, laughed amusedly. </p><p> “Answering your question, Mrs. Engle,”</p><p>he chuckled, “I’d certainly know her for </p><p>Virginia Page! When we come to know her </p><p>better maybe she will allow us to call her </p><p>Cousin Virginia? In the meantime, to play </p><p>safe, I suppose that to us she’d better be </p><p>just Doctor Page?” </p><p> “John is as full of nonsense after banking</p><p>hours,” explained Mrs. Engle, still affec- </p><p>tionately patting Virginia’s hand, “as he is </p><p>crammed with business from nine until four. </p><p>Which makes life with him possible; it’s like </p><p>having two husbands, makes for variety </p><p>and so saves me from flirting with other </p><p>men. Now, tell us all about yourself.” </p><p>Virginia, who had been a little stiff- </p><p>muscled until now, leaned back among the </p><p>cushions unconscious of a half-sigh of con- </p><p>tent and of her relaxation. During the long </p><p>day San Juan had sought to frighten, to re- </p><p>pel her. Now it was making ample </p><p>amends. First the companionable society </p><p>of Rod Norton, then the simple, hearty </p><p>welcome here. She returned the pressure of </p><p>Mrs. Engle’s soft, warm hands in sheer </p><p>gratitude. </p><p>AFTER THAT they chatted </p><p>lightly, Engle gradually withdraw- </p><p>ing from the conversation and </p><p>secretly watching the girl keenly, studying </p><p>her play of expression, seeking according </p><p>to his habit to make his guarded estimate of </p><p>a new factor in his household. From Vir- </p><p>ginia’s face his eyes went swiftly now and </p><p>then to his daughter’s, animated in her </p><p>tete-a-t&amp;te with the sheriff. Once, when </p><p>Virginia turned unexpectedly, she caught </p><p>the hint of a troubled frown in his eyes. </p><p> Broad double doors in the west wall of the</p><p>living-room gave entrance to the patio. </p><p>The doors were open now to the slowly </p><p>freshening night air and from where she sat </p><p>Virginia Page had a glimpse of a charming </p><p>court, an orange-tree heavy with fruit and </p><p>blossom, red and yellow roses, a sleeping </p><p>fountain whose still water reflected star- </p><p>shine and the lamp in its niche under a </p><p>grape-vine arbor. When Norton and Flor- </p><p>ence Engle strolled out into the inviting </p><p>patio Engle, breaking his silence, leaned </p><p>forward and dominated the conversation. </p><p> Virginia had been doing the major part of</p><p>the talking, answering questions about Mrs. </p><p>Engle’s girlhood home, telling something of </p><p>herself. Now John Engle, reminding his </p><p>wife that their guest must be consumed with </p><p>curiosity about her new environment, </p><p>sought to interest her in this and that in and </p><p>about San Juan. </p><p> “There was a killing this afternoon,” he</p><p>admitted, quietly. “No doubt you know of </p><p>it and have been shocked by it, and perhaps </p><p>on account of it have a little misjudged San </p><p>Juan. We are not all cutthroats here, by </p><p>any manner of means; I think I might al- </p><p>most say that the rough element is in the </p><p>minority. We are in a state of transition, </p><p>like all other frontier settlements. The </p><p>railroad, though it doesn’t come closer than </p><p>the little tank station where you took thestage </p><p>this morning, has touched our lives out here. </p><p> “A railroad brings civilizing influences;</p><p>but the first thing it does is to bring in a </p><p>surging tide of forces contending against </p><p>law and order. Pioneers,” and he smiled </p><p>his slow, grave, tolerant smile, “are as often </p><p>as not tumultuous-blooded and self-suffi- </p><p>cient and prone to kick over the established </p><p>traces. We’ve got that class to deal with</p><p>now—and that boy, Rod Norton, with his </p><p>job cut out for him, is getting results. He’s </p><p>the biggest man, not only in the county, but </p><p>in this end of the State right now!” </p><p> Further to that he told her something of</p><p>the sheriff. Young Norton, having re- </p><p>turned from college some three years before </p><p>to live the only life possible to one of his </p><p>blood, had become manager of his father’s </p><p>ranch in and beyond the San Juan Moun- </p><p>tains. At the time Billy Norton was the </p><p>county sheriff and had his hands full. Ru- </p><p>The Bells of San Juan </p><p>55 </p><p>mor said that he had promised himself to </p><p>“get” a certain man; Engle admitted that </p><p>that man was Jim Galloway of the Casa </p><p>Blanca. But either Galloway or a tool of </p><p>Galloway or some other man had “gotten” </p><p>Billy Norton, shooting him down in his own </p><p>cabin and from the back, putting a shotgun </p><p>charge of buckshot into his brain. </p><p> It had occurred shortly after Roderick</p><p>Norton’s return, shortly before the expira- </p><p>tion of Billy Norton’s term of office. Rod </p><p>Norton, putting another man in his place on </p><p>the ranch, had buried his father and then </p><p>had asked of the county his election to the </p><p>place made empty by his father’s death. </p><p>Though he was young, men believed in him. </p><p>The election returns gave him his place by a </p><p>crushing majority. </p><p> “And he has done good work,” concluded</p><p>Engle thoughtfully. “Because of what he </p><p>has done, because he does not make an ar- </p><p>rest until he has his evidence and then </p><p>drives hard to a certain conviction, he has </p><p>come to be called ‘Dead-sure Norton’ and has </p><p>come to be respected everywhere and feared </p><p>more than a little. Until now it has become </p><p>virtually a two-man fight, Rod Norton </p><p>against Jim Galloway.” </p><p> “John,” interposed Mrs. Engle, “aren’t</p><p>you giving Virginia rather a somber side of </p><p>things?” </p><p> “Maybe I am,” he agreed. “But this</p><p>killing of the Las Palmas man in broad day- </p><p>light has become pretty close to filling my </p><p>mind. Who’s going to be next?” His eyes </p><p>went swiftly toward the patio, taking stock </p><p>of the two figures there. Then he shrugged, </p><p>went to the table for a cigar and returned </p><p>smiling to inform Virginia of life on the </p><p>desert and in the valleys beyond the moun- </p><p>tains, of scattering attempts at reclama- </p><p>tion and irrigation, of how one made towns </p><p>of sun-dried mud, of where the adobe soil </p><p>itself was found, drifted over with sand in </p><p>the shade of the cottonwoods. </p><p> But Mrs. Engle’s sigh, while her husband</p><p>spoke of black mud and straw, testified that </p><p>her thoughts had clung about those events </p><p>and possibilities which she herself had </p><p>asked him to avoid; her eyes wandered to</p><p>the tall, rudely-garbed figure dimly seen in </p><p>the patio. Virginia, recalling Jim Galloway </p><p>as she had seen him on the stage, heavy- </p><p>bodied, narrow-hipped, masterful alike in </p><p>carriage and the look of the prominent eyes, </p><p>glanced with Mrs. Engle toward Rod </p><p>Norton. </p><p> He was laughing at something passing</p><p>between him and Florence and for the mo- </p><p>ment appeared utterly boyish. Were it not </p><p>for the grim reminder of the forty-five cali- </p><p>ber revolver which the nature of his sworn </p><p>duties did not allow of his laying aside even </p><p>upon a night like this, it would have been </p><p>easy to,forget that he was all that which the </p><p>one word “sheriff” connotes in a land like </p><p>that about San Juan. </p><p> “Can’t get away from it, can we?” Engle</p><p>having caught the look in the two women’s </p><p>eyes broke off abruptly in what he was say- </p><p>ing and now sat studying his cigar with </p><p>frowning eyes. “Man against man, and </p><p>the whole county knows it, one employing </p><p>whatever criminal’s tools slip into his hands, </p><p>the other fighting fair and in the open. </p><p>Man against man and in a death-grapple </p><p>just because they are the men they are, with </p><p>one backed up by a hang-dog crowd like </p><p>Kid Rickard and Antone and the other </p><p>playing virtually a lone hand. What’s the </p><p>end going to be?” </p><p>Virginia thought of Ignacio Chavez. </p><p>He, had he been here, would have answered: </p><p>“In the end there will be the ringing of </p><p>the bells for a man dead. You will see! </p><p>Which one? Quiensabe? The bells will ring.” </p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>THROUGH the silence of the outer </p><p>night, as though in truth Ignacio </p><p>Chavez were speaking and in proph- </p><p>ecy, came billowing the slow beating of the </p><p>deep mourning bell. Mrs. Engle sighed; </p><p>Engle frowned; Virginia for her part sat </p><p>rigid, at once disturbed and oppressed. </p><p> “How can you stand that terrible bell?”</p><p>she cried softly. “I should think that it </p><p>would drive you mad! How long does he </p><p>ring it?” </p><p> “Once every hour until midnight,” an-</p><p>swered Engle, his face once more placid as </p><p>he withdrew his look from the patio and</p><p>transferred it to his cigar. And then, with </p><p>a half-smile: “There are many San Juans, </p><p>Cousin Virginia; there is, in all the wide </p><p>world, but one San Juan of the Bells! It is </p><p>our distinctive mark; you would not take </p><p>that from us? Now that you are to become </p><p>of San Juan you must, like the rest of us, </p><p>take a pride in San Juan’s bells. Which </p><p>you will do soon or late; perhaps just as soon </p><p>as you come to know something of their </p><p>separate and collective histories.” </p><p>56 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Tell her, John,” suggested Mrs. Engle,</p><p>again obviously anxious to dispel the more </p><p>lugubrious and tragic atmosphere of the </p><p>evening with any chance talk which might </p><p>offer itself. </p><p> “Let her wait until Ignacio can tell her,”</p><p>laughed Engle. “No one else can tell it so </p><p>well, and certainly no one else has an equal </p><p>pride or even an equal right in the matter.” </p><p> But, though he refused to take up the</p><p>colorful theme of the biographies of the </p><p>Captain, the Dancer, Lolita and the rest, </p><p>John Engle began to speak lightly upon an </p><p>associated topic, first asking the girl if she </p><p>knew with what ceremony these ancient </p><p>bells had been cast; when she shook her </p><p>head and while the slow throbbing beat </p><p>of the Captain still insisted through the </p><p>night’s silences, he explained that doubtless </p><p>all six of Ignacio Chavez’s bells had taken </p><p>form under the calm gaze of high priests of </p><p>old Spain. </p><p> For legend had it that all six were from</p><p>their beginnings destined for the new mis- </p><p>sions to be scattered broadcast throughout </p><p>a new land, to ring out the Word of God to </p><p>heathen ears. And bells meant for such </p><p>high service were never cast without grave </p><p>religious service and sacrifice. </p><p> Through the darkness of long dead cen-</p><p>turies the girl’s stimulated fancies followed </p><p>the man’s words; she visualized the great </p><p>caldrons in which the fusing metals grew </p><p>red and an intolerable white; saw men and </p><p>women draw near, proud blue blood on one </p><p>hand and the lowly on the other, with one </p><p>thought; saw the maidens and ladies from </p><p>the courtyards of the king’s palace as they </p><p>removed golden bracelets and necklaces </p><p>from white arms and throats, so that the </p><p>red and yellow gold might go with their </p><p>prayers into the molten metals, enrichen- </p><p>ing them, while those whose poverty was </p><p>great but whose devotion was greater </p><p>offered what little silver ornaments they </p><p>could. Carved silver vases, golden cups, </p><p>minted coins and cherished ornaments, all </p><p>were offered generously, devoutly, until the </p><p>blazing caldrons had mingled the queen’s </p><p>girdle-clasps with a bauble from the beggar </p><p>girl.</p><p> “And in the end,” smiled Engle, “there</p><p>are no bells with the sweet tone of old mis- </p><p>sion bells, or with their soft eloquence.” </p><p> While he was talking Ignacio Chavez had</p><p>allowed the dangling rope to slip from his </p><p>hands so that the Captain rested quiet in </p><p>the starshine. Roderick and Florence were </p><p>coming in through the wide patio door; </p><p>Norton was just saying that Florrie had </p><p>promised to play something for him when </p><p>the front door knocker announced another </p><p>visitor. Florence made a little disdainful </p><p>face as though she guessed who the newest </p><p>caller would be; Engle went to the door. </p><p> Even Virginia Page in this land of</p><p>strangers knew who the man was. For she </p><p>had seen enough of him today, on the stage </p><p>across the wean,' miles of desert, to remem- </p><p>ber him and to dislike him. He was the </p><p>man whom Galloway and the stage driver </p><p>had called “Doc,” the sole representative of </p><p>the medical fraternity in San Juan until her </p><p>coming. She disliked him first vaguely and </p><p>with purely feminine instinct; secondly be- </p><p>cause of an air, which he never laid aside, of </p><p>serene consciousness of self-superiority. </p><p> He had come into what he was pleased to</p><p>look upon as a community of nobodies, </p><p>people whom he had the right to look on as </p><p>his inferiors intellectually and culturally. </p><p>He was of that type of man-animal that </p><p>lends itself to fairly accurate cataloging at </p><p>the end of the first five minutes’ acquaint- </p><p>ance. The most striking of the physical </p><p>attributes about his person as he entered </p><p>were his little mustache and neatly-trimmed </p><p>beard and the diamond stickpin in his tie. </p><p>Remove these articles and it would have </p><p>been difficult to distinguish him from </p><p>countless thousands of other inefficient and </p><p>opinionated individuals. </p><p> Virginia noted that both Mr. and Mrs.</p><p>Engle shook hands with him if not very cor- </p><p>dially at least with good-humored tolera- </p><p>tion; that Florence treated him to a stiff </p><p>little nod; that Roderick Norton from across </p><p>the room greeted him coolly. </p><p> “Dr. Patten,” Engle was saying, “this</p><p>is our cousin Virginia Page.” </p><p> Dr. Patten acknowledged the introduc-</p><p>tion and sat down, turning to ask “how </p><p>Florrie was today.” Virginia smiled, sens- </p><p>ing a rebuke in his manner; today on the </p><p>stage she had made it obvious even to him </p><p>that if she must speak with a stranger she </p><p>would vastly prefer the talk of the stage- </p><p>driver to that of Dr. Caleb Patten. </p><p> When Florence, replying briefly, turned</p><p>to the piano Patten addressed Norton. </p><p> “What was our good sheriff doing to-</p><p>day?” he asked banteringly, as though the </p><p>subject he chose were the most apt one </p><p>imaginable for jest. “Another man killed </p><p>The Bells of San Juan </p><p>57 </p><p>in broad daylight and no one to answer for </p><p>it! Why don’t you go get ’em, Roddy?” </p><p>Norton stared at him steadily and finally </p><p>said merely- </p><p> “When a disease has fastened itself upon</p><p>the body of a community it takes time to </p><p>work a cure, Dr. Patten.” </p><p> “But not much time to let the life out of a</p><p>man like the chap from Las Palmas! Why, </p><p>the man who did the shooting couldn’t have </p><p>done a nicer job if he’d been a surgeon. </p><p>One bullet square through the cartoid </p><p>artery—that leads from the heart to the </p><p>head,” he explained as though his listeners </p><p>were children athirst for knowledge which </p><p>he and none other could impart. “The </p><p>cerebrum penetrated by a second-” </p><p> What other technicality and elucidation</p><p>might have followed was lost in a thunder- </p><p>ous crashing of the piano keys as Florence </p><p>Engle strove to drown the man’s utterance </p><p>and succeeded so well that for an instant he </p><p>sat gaping at her. </p><p> “I can’t stand that man!” Florence said</p><p>sharply to Norton, and though the words </p><p>did not travel across the room Virginia was </p><p>surprised that even so completely armored </p><p>an individual as Caleb Patten could fail to </p><p>grasp the girl’s meaning. </p><p> When Florence had .pounded her way</p><p>through a noisy bit of rag-time Caleb Pat- </p><p>ten, with one of his host’s cigars lighted, </p><p>was leaning a little forward in his chair, </p><p>alert to seize the first opportunity of snatch- </p><p>ing a fresh conversation by the throat. </p><p> “Kid Rickard admits killing Bisbee,” he</p><p>said to Norton. “What are you going to </p><p>do about it? The first thing I heard when </p><p>I got in from a professional call a little while </p><p>ago was that Rickard was swaggering </p><p>around town, saying that you wouldn’t </p><p>gather him in because you were afraid </p><p>to.” </p><p> The sheriff’s face remained unmoved</p><p>though the others looked curiously to him </p><p>and back to Patten who was easy and com-</p><p>placent and vaguely irritating. </p><p> “I imagine you haven’t seen Jim Gallo-</p><p>way since you got in, have you?” Norton </p><p>returned quietlv. </p><p> “No,” said Patten. “Why? What has</p><p>Galloway got to do with it?” </p><p> “Ask him. He says Rickard killed Bis-</p><p>bee in self-defense.” </p><p> “Oh,” said Patten. And then, “If Gal-</p><p>loway says so I guess you are right in letting </p><p>the Kid go.” </p><p> And, a trifle hastily it seemed to Vir-</p><p>ginia, he switched talk into another chan- </p><p>nel, telling of the case on which he had been </p><p>out today, enlarging upon its difficulties </p><p>with which, it appeared, he had been emi- </p><p>nently fitted to cope. There was an </p><p>amused twinkle in John Engle’s eyes as he </p><p>listened. </p><p> “By the way, Patten,” the banker ob-</p><p>served when there came a pause, “you’ve </p><p>got a rival in town. Had you heard?” </p><p> “What do you mean?” asked the phy-</p><p>sician. </p><p> “When I introduced you just now to our</p><p>cousin Virginia, I should have told you; she </p><p>is Dr. Page, M. D.” </p><p> Again Patten said “Oh,” but this time in</p><p>a tone which through its plain implication </p><p>put a sudden flash into Virginia’s eyes. As </p><p>he looked toward her there was a half-sneer </p><p>upon his lips which his scanty growth of </p><p>beard and mustache failed to hide. Had he </p><p>gone on to say, “A lady doctor, eh?” and </p><p>laughed, the case would not have been al- </p><p>tered. </p><p> “It seems so funny for a girl to be a</p><p>doctor,” said Florence, for the first time </p><p>referring in any way to Virginia since she </p><p>had flown to the door, expecting Norton </p><p>alone. Even now she did not look toward </p><p>her kinswoman. </p><p>JOHN ENGLE replied, speaking </p><p>crisply. But just what he said </p><p>Virginia did not know. For sud- </p><p>denly her whole attention was withdrawn </p><p>from the conversation, fixed and held by</p><p>something moving in the patio. First </p><p>she had noted a slight change in Rod Nor- </p><p>ton’s eyes, saw them grow keen and watch- </p><p>ful, noted that they had turned toward the </p><p>door opening into the little court where the </p><p>fountain was, where the wall lamp threw </p><p>its rays wanly among the shrubs and </p><p>through the grape arbor. He had seen </p><p>something move out there; from where she </p><p>sat she could look the way he looked and </p><p>mark how a clump of rose bushes had been </p><p>disturbed and now were growing motion- </p><p>less again in the quiet night. </p><p> Wondering, she looked again to Norton.</p><p>His eyes told nothing now save that they </p><p>were keen and watchful. Whether or not </p><p>he knew what it was so guardedly stirring in </p><p>the patio, whether he like herself had merely </p><p>seen the gently agitated leaves of the bushes, </p><p>she could not even guess. She started when </p><p>58 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Engle addressed some trifling remark to </p><p>her; while she evaded the direct answer she </p><p>was fully conscious of the sheriff’s eyes </p><p>steady upon her. He, no doubt, was won- </p><p>dering what she had seen. </p><p> It was only a moment later that the</p><p>sheriff rose and went to Mrs. Engle, telling </p><p>her briefly that he had had a day of it, in </p><p>the saddle since dawn, wishing her good </p><p>night. He shook hands with Engle, nodded </p><p>to Patten, and coming to Virginia said </p><p>lightly but, she thought, with an almost </p><p>sternly serious look in his eyes: </p><p> “We’re all hoping you like San Juan,</p><p>Miss Page. And you will, too, if the desert </p><p>stillness doesn’t get on your nerves. But </p><p>then silence isn’t such a bad thing after all, </p><p>is it? Good night.” </p><p> She understood his meaning and though a</p><p>thrill of excitement ran through her blood </p><p>answered laughingly: </p><p> “Shall a woman learn from the desert?</p><p>Have I been such a chatter-box, Mrs. </p><p>Engle, that I am to be admonished at the </p><p>beginning to learn to hold my tongue?” </p><p>Florence looked at her curiously, turned </p><p>toward Norton and then went with him to </p><p>the door. For a moment their voices came </p><p>in an indistinguishable murmur down the </p><p>hallway; then Norton was gone and Flor- </p><p>ence returned slowly to the living-room. </p><p> Again and again Virginia looked out into</p><p>the patio. Never a twig stirred now; all </p><p>was as quiet as the sleeping fountains, as </p><p>silent and mystery-filled as the desert itself. </p><p>Had Roderick Norton seen more than she? </p><p>Did he know who had been out there? </p><p>Was here the beginning of some further </p><p>sinister outgrowth of the lawlessness of </p><p>Kid Rickard? Of the animosity of Jim </p><p>Galloway? Was she presently to see Nor- </p><p>ton himself slipping into the patio from the </p><p>other side, was she again to hear the rattle </p><p>of pistol shots? </p><p> He had asked that she say nothing; she</p><p>had unhesitatingly given him her promise. </p><p>Had she so unquestioningly done as he had </p><p>requested because he was the sheriff who </p><p>represented the law, or because he was</p><p>Roderick Norton who stood for fine, up- </p><p>standing manhood? Again she felt Flor- </p><p>ence Engle’e eyes fixed upon her. </p><p>“Florence is prepared at the beginning to </p><p>dislike me,” she thought. “Why? Just </p><p>because I walked with him from the hotel?” </p><p>In the heat of an argument with Mrs. </p><p>Engle there came an interruption. The </p><p>banker’s wife was insisting that Virginia </p><p>“do the only sensible thing in the world,” </p><p>that she accept a home under the Engle </p><p>roof, occupying the room already made </p><p>ready for her. Virginia, warmed by the </p><p>cordial invitation, while deeply grateful </p><p>felt that she had no right to accept. She </p><p>had come to San Juan to make her own way; </p><p>she had no claim against the hospitality of </p><p>her kinswoman, certainly no such claim as </p><p>was implied now. </p><p> Besides, there was Elmer Page. Her</p><p>brother was coming to join her tomorrow </p><p>or the next day and as soon as it could be </p><p>arranged they would take a house all by </p><p>themselves, or if that proved impossible, </p><p>would have a suite at the hotel. At the </p><p>moment when it seemed that a deadlock had </p><p>come between Mrs. Engle’s eagerness to </p><p>mother her cousin’s daughter and Vir- </p><p>ginia’s inborn sense of independence, the </p><p>interruption came. </p><p> It arrived in the form of a boy of ten or</p><p>twelve, a ragged, scantily-clothed, swarthy </p><p>youngster, rubbing a great toe against a </p><p>bare leg, while from the front door he an- </p><p>nounced that Ignacio Chavez was sick, </p><p>that he had eaten something muy malo, </p><p>that he had pains and that he prayed that </p><p>the doctor cure him. </p><p> Patten grunted his disgust.</p><p> “Tell him to wait,” he said briefly. And,</p><p>in explanation to the others, “There’s noth- </p><p>ing the matter with him. I saw him on the </p><p>street just before I came. And wasn’t he </p><p>ringing his bell not fifteen minutes ago?” </p><p>But the boy had not completed his mes- </p><p>sage. Ignacio was sick and did not wish to </p><p>die and so had sent him to ask the Miss </p><p>Lady Doctor to come to him. Virginia </p><p>rose swiftly. </p><p> “You see,” she said to Mrs. Engle,</p><p>“what a nuisance it would be if I lived with</p><p>you? May I come to see you tomorrow?” </p><p>While she said good night Engle got his hat. </p><p>“I’ll go with you,” he said. “But, like </p><p>Patten, I don’t believe there is much the </p><p>matter with Chavez. Maybe he thinks </p><p>he’ll get a free drink of whisky.” </p><p> “You see again,” laughed Virginia from</p><p>the doorway, “what it would be like, Mrs. </p><p>Engle; if every time I had to make a call </p><p>and Mr. Engle deemed it necessary to go </p><p>with me—I’d have to split my fees with </p><p>him at the very least! And I don’t believe </p><p>that I could afford to do that.” </p><p> “You could give me all that Ignacio pays</p><p>The Bells of San Juan </p><p>59 </p><p>you,” chuckled Engle, and never miss </p><p>it!” </p><p> The boy waited for them and, when they</p><p>came out into the starlight, flitted on ahead </p><p>of them. When they got to the cotton- </p><p>woods a man stepped out to meet them. </p><p>“Hello,” said Engle, “it’s Norton.” </p><p> “I sent the boy for Miss Page,” said</p><p>Norton quicky. “I had to have a word </p><p>with her immediately. And I’m glad that </p><p>you came, Engle. I want a favor of you; </p><p>a mighty big favor of Miss Page.” </p><p> The boy had passed on through the shad-</p><p>ows and now was to be seen on the street. </p><p> “I guess you know you can count on me,</p><p>Rod,” said Engle, showing no surprise at </p><p>Norton’s information. </p><p> “I want you, when you go back to the</p><p>house, to say that you have learned that </p><p>Miss Page likes horseback-riding; then send </p><p>a horse for her to the hotel stable, so that </p><p>if she likes she can have it in the early </p><p>morning. And say nothing about my hav- </p><p>ing sent the boy.” </p><p> Engle did not answer immediately. He</p><p>and Virginia stood trying to see the sheriff’s </p><p>features through the darkness. He had </p><p>spoken quietly enough and yet there was an </p><p>odd new note in his voice; it was easy to </p><p>imagine how the muscles about his lean </p><p>jaw had tensioned, how his eyes were again </p><p>the hard eyes of a man who saw his fight </p><p>before him. </p><p> “I can trust you, John,” continued Nor-</p><p>ton quickly. “I can trust Ignacio Chavez; </p><p>I can trust Julius Struve. And, if you want </p><p>it in words of one syllable, I can not trust </p><p>Caleb Patten!” </p><p> “Hm,” said Engle. “I think you’re mis-</p><p>taken there, my boy.” </p><p> “Maybe,” returned Norton. “But I</p><p>can’t afford right now to make any mis- </p><p>takes. Further,” and in the gloom they </p><p>saw his shoulders lifted in a shrug, “I am </p><p>trusting Miss Page because I’ve got to! </p><p>Which may not sound pretty, but which is</p><p>the truth.” </p><p> “Of course I’ll do what you ask,” Engle</p><p>said. “Is there anything else?” </p><p> “No. Just to go on with Miss Page to</p><p>see Ignacio. He will pretend to be doubled </p><p>up with pain and will tell his story of the </p><p>tinned meat he ate for dinner. Then you </p><p>can see her to the hotel and go back home, </p><p>sending the horse over right away. Then </p><p>she will ride with me to see a man who is </p><p>hurt—or she will not and I’ll have to take a </p><p>chance on Patten.” </p><p>“Who is it?” demanded Engle sharply. </p><p>“It’s ‘Brocky’ Lane,” returned Norton, </p><p>and again his voice told of rigid muscles </p><p>and hard eyes. “He’s hurt bad, too, John. </p><p>And, if we’re to do him any good we’d better </p><p>be about it.” </p><p> Engle said nothing. But the slow, deep</p><p>breath he drew into his lungs could not have </p><p>been more eloquent of his emotion had it </p><p>been expelled in a curse. </p><p> “I’ll slip around the back way to the</p><p>hotel,” said Norton. “I’ll be ready when </p><p>Miss Page comes in. Good night, John.” </p><p>And silently, without awaiting promise or </p><p>protest from the girl, he was gone into the </p><p>deeper shadows of the cottonwoods. </p><p>CHAPTER VI </p><p>IGNACIO CHAVEZ, because thus </p><p>he could be of service to el sen or </p><p>Roderico Nortone whom he ad- </p><p>mired vastly and loved like a brother, drew </p><p>to the dregs upon his fine Latin talent, </p><p>doubled up and otherwise contorted and </p><p>twisted his lithe body until the sweat stood </p><p>out upon his forehead. His groans would </p><p>have done ample justice to the occasion </p><p>had he, in sober truth, been dying. </p><p> Virginia treated him sparingly to a harm-</p><p>less potion she had secured at her room on </p><p>the way by, put the bottle into the hands of </p><p>Ignacio’s withered and anxious old mother, </p><p>informed the half-dozen Indian onlookers </p><p>that she had arrived in time and that the </p><p>bell-ringer would live, and then was impa- </p><p>tient to go with Engle to Struve’s hotel. </p><p>Here Engle left her to return to his home</p><p>and to send the saddle-horse he had prom- </p><p>ised Norton. </p><p> “You can ride, can’t you, Virginia?” he</p><p>had asked her. </p><p> “Yes,” she assured him.</p><p>“Then I’ll send Persis around; she’s the </p><p>prettiest thing in horseflesh you ever saw. </p><p>And the gamest. And, Virginia-” </p><p> He hesitated.</p><p> “Well?” she asked.</p><p> “There’s not a squarer, whiter man in the</p><p>world than Rod Norton,” he said emphat- </p><p>ically. “Now good night and good luck </p><p>and be sure to drop in on us tomorrow.” </p><p>She watched him as he went swiftly </p><p>down the street; then she turned and went </p><p>into the hotel, down the hall which echoed </p><p>to the click of her heels, and to her room. </p><p>6o </p><p>Adventure </p><p>She had barely had time to change for her </p><p>ride and to glance at her “war bag” when a </p><p>discreet knock sounded at her door. Going </p><p>to the door she found that it was Julius </p><p>Struve instead of Norton. </p><p> “You are to come with me,” said the</p><p>hotel-keeper softly. “He is waiting with </p><p>the horses.” </p><p> They passed through the dark dining-</p><p>room, into the pitch-black kitchen and out </p><p>at the rear of the house. A moment Struve </p><p>paused, listening. Then, touching her </p><p>sleeve, he hurried away into the night, going </p><p>toward the black line of cottonwoods, the </p><p>girl keeping close to his heels. </p><p> At the dry arroyo Norton was waiting,</p><p>holding two saddled horses. Without a </p><p>word he gave her his hand, saw her mounted, </p><p>surrendered Persis’ jerking reins into her </p><p>gauntleted hands and swung up to the back </p><p>of his own horse. Struve had already </p><p>turned back to the hotel. In another mo- </p><p>ment, and still in silence, Virginia and Nor- </p><p>ton were riding away from San Juan, keep- </p><p>ing in the shadows of the trees, headed </p><p>toward the mountains in the north. </p><p> And now suddenly Virginia found that</p><p>she was giving herself over utterly, unex- </p><p>pectedly to a keen, pulsing joy of life. She </p><p>had surrendered into the sheriff’s hands the </p><p>little leather case which contained her </p><p>emergency bottles and instruments; they </p><p>had left San Juan a couple of hundred yards </p><p>behind; their horses were galloping; her </p><p>stirrup struck now and then against Nor- </p><p>ton’s boot. </p><p> John Engle had not been unduly extrava-</p><p>gant in praise of the mare Persis; Virginia </p><p>sensed rather than saw clearly the perfect, </p><p>beautiful creature which carried her, de- </p><p>lighted in the swinging gallop, drew into her </p><p>soul something of the serene grandeur of a </p><p>starlit night on the desert. The soft thud </p><p>of shod hoofs in yielding soil was music to </p><p>her, mingled as it was with the creak of </p><p>saddle leather, the jingle of bridle and spur </p><p>chains. She wondered if there had ever </p><p>been so perfect a night, if she had ever </p><p>mounted so finely bred a saddle-animal. </p><p> Far ahead the San Juan Mountains lifted</p><p>their serrated ridge of ebony. On all other </p><p>sides the flat lands stretched out seeming to </p><p>have no end, suggesting to the fancy that </p><p>they were kin in limitlessness to the clear </p><p>expanse of the sky. On all hands little </p><p>wind-shaped ridges were like crests of long </p><p>waves in an ocean which had just now been </p><p>stilled, brooded over by the desert- silence </p><p>and the desert stars. </p><p> “I suppose,” said Norton at last, “that</p><p>it’s up to me to explain.” </p><p> “Then begin,” said Virginia, “by telling</p><p>me where we are going.” </p><p> He swung up his arm, pointing.</p><p> “Yonder. To the mountains. We’ll</p><p>reach them in about two hours and a half. </p><p>Then, in another two hours or so, we’ll </p><p>come to where Brocky is. Way up on the </p><p>flank of Mt. Temple. It’s going to be a </p><p>long, hard climb. And for you, at the end </p><p>of a tiresome day-” </p><p> “How about yourself?” she asked quickly,</p><p>and he knew that she was smiling at him </p><p>through the dark. “Unless you’re made of </p><p>iron I’m almost inclined to believe that </p><p>after your friend Brocky I’ll have another </p><p>patient. Who is he?” </p><p> “Brocky Lane? I was going to tell you.</p><p>You saw something stirring in the patio at </p><p>Engle’s? I had seen it first; it was Ignacio </p><p>who had slipped in under the wide arch </p><p>from the gardens at the rear of the house. </p><p>He had been sent for me by Tom Cutter, </p><p>my deputy. Brocky Lane is foreman of a </p><p>big cattle-ranch lying just beyond the </p><p>mountains; he is also working with me and </p><p>with Cutter, although until I’ve told you </p><p>nobody knows it but ourselves and John </p><p>Engle. Before the night is out you’ll </p><p>know rather a good deal about what is go- </p><p>ing on, Miss Page,” he added, thoughtfully. </p><p> “More than you’d have been willing for</p><p>me to know if circumstances hadn’t forced </p><p>your hand?” </p><p> “Yes,” he admitted coolly. “To get</p><p>anywhere we’ve had to sit tight on the </p><p>game we’re playing. But, from the word</p><p>Cutter brings, poor old Brocky is pretty </p><p>hard hit, and I couldn’t take any chances </p><p>with his life even though it means taking </p><p>chances in another direction.” </p><p> He might have been a shade less frank;</p><p>and yet she liked him none the less for giving </p><p>her the truth bluntly. He was but tacitly </p><p>admitting that he knew nothing of her; and </p><p>yet in this case he would prefer to call upon </p><p>her than on Caleb Patten. </p><p> “No, I don’t trust Patten,” he continued,</p><p>the chain of thought being inevitable. </p><p>“Not that I’d call him crooked so much as a </p><p>fool for Jim Galloway to juggle with. He </p><p>talks too much.” </p><p> “You wish me to say nothing of to-</p><p>night’s ride?” </p><p>The Bells of San Juan </p><p>61 </p><p> “Absolutely nothing. If you are missed</p><p>before we get back Struve will explain that </p><p>you were called to see old Ramorez, a half- </p><p>breed over yonder toward Las Estrellas. </p><p>That is, provided we get back too late for it </p><p>to appear likely that you are just resting in </p><p>your room or getting things shipshape in </p><p>your office. That’s why I am explaining </p><p>about Brocky.” </p><p> “Since you represent the law in San Juan,</p><p>Mr. Norton,” she told him, “since further </p><p>Mr. Engle endorses all that you are doing, I </p><p>believe that I can go blindfolded a little. </p><p>I’d rather do that than have you forced </p><p>against your better judgment to place con- </p><p>fidence in a stranger.” </p><p> “That’s fair of you,” he said heartily.</p><p>“But there are certain matters which you </p><p>will have to be told. Brocky Lane has been </p><p>shot down by one of Jim Galloway’s crowd. </p><p>It was a coward’s job done by a man who </p><p>would run a hundred miles rather than meet </p><p>Brocky in the open. And now the thing </p><p>which we don’t want known is that Lane </p><p>even so much as set foot on Mt. Temple. </p><p>We don’t want it known that he was any- </p><p>where but on Las Cruces Rancho; that he </p><p>was doing anything but giving his time to his </p><p>duties as foreman there.” </p><p> “In particular you don’t want Jim Gallo-</p><p>way to know?” </p><p> “In particular I don’t want Jim Galloway</p><p>to so much as suspect that Brocky Lane or </p><p>Tom Cutter or myself have any interest in </p><p>Mt. Temple,” he said emphatically. </p><p> “But if the man who shot him is one of</p><p>Galloway’s crowd, as you say-” </p><p> “He’ll do no talking for a while. After</p><p>having seen Brocky drop he took one chance </p><p>and showed half of his cowardly carcass </p><p>around a boulder. Whereupon Brocky, </p><p>weak and sick and dizzy as he was, popped a </p><p>bullet into him.” </p><p> She shuddered.</p><p> “Is there nothing but killing of men</p><p>among you people?” she cried sharply.</p><p>“First the sheepman from Las Palmas, </p><p>then Brocky Lane, then the man who shot </p><p>him-” </p><p> “Brocky didn’t kill Moraga,” Norton</p><p>explained quietly. “But he dropped him </p><p>and then made him throw down his gun and </p><p>crawl out of the brush. Then Tom Cutter </p><p>gathered him in, took him across the county </p><p>line, gave him into the hands of Ben Roberts </p><p>who is sheriff over there, and came on to </p><p>San Juan. Roberts will simply hold Mor- </p><p>aga on some trifling charge and see that he </p><p>keeps his mouth shut until we are ready for </p><p>him to talk.” </p><p> “Then Brocky Lane and Tom Cutter</p><p>were together on Mt. Temple?” </p><p> “Near enough for Tom to hear the shoot-</p><p>ing.” </p><p> They grew silent again. Clearly Norton</p><p>had done what explaining he deemed neces- </p><p>sary and was taking her no further into his </p><p>confidences. She told herself that he was </p><p>right, that these were not merely his own </p><p>personal secrets, that as yet he would be un- </p><p>wise to trust a stranger furdier than he was </p><p>forced to. And yet, unreasonably or not, </p><p>she felt a little hurt. She had liked him </p><p>from the beginning and from the beginning </p><p>she felt that in a case such as his she would </p><p>have trusted to intuition and have held back </p><p>nothing. But she asked none of the ques- </p><p>tions which none the less insisted upon pre- </p><p>senting themselves to her: </p><p> What was the thing that had brought</p><p>both Brocky Lane and Tom Cutter to Mt. </p><p>Temple? What had they been seeking </p><p>there in a wilderness of crag and cliff? </p><p>Why was Roderick Norton so determined </p><p>that Jim Galloway should not so much as </p><p>suspect that these men were watchful in </p><p>the mountains? What sinister chain of </p><p>circumstances had impelled Moraga, who </p><p>Norton said was Galloway’s man, to shoot </p><p>down the cattle foreman? And Galloway </p><p>himself, what type of man must he be if all </p><p>that she had heard of him were true, what </p><p>were his ambitions, his plans, his power? </p><p>BEFORE long Norton pointed out </p><p>to her, looming ever vaster before </p><p>them, the shadowy form of Mt. </p><p>Temple, its mass of rock, of wind-blown,</p><p>wind-carved peaks lifted in somber defiance </p><p>against the star-filled sky. It brooded </p><p>darkly over the lower slopes, like an incubus </p><p>it dominated the other spines and ridges, </p><p>its gorges filled with shadow and mystery, </p><p>its precipices making the sense reel dizzily. </p><p>And somewhere, high up there against the </p><p>skv, alone, suffering, perhaps dying, a man </p><p>had waited through the slow hours, still </p><p>waited for their coming. How slowly she </p><p>and Norton were riding, how heartless of </p><p>her to have felt the thrill of pleasure which </p><p>had possessed her so utterly an hour ago! </p><p> Or less than an hour. For now again,</p><p>wandering out far across the open lands, </p><p>came the heavy mourning of the bell. </p><p>62 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “How far away can one hear it?” she</p><p>asked, surprised that from so far away its </p><p>ringing came so clearly. </p><p> “I don’t know how many miles,” he an-</p><p>swered. “We’ll hear it from the mountain. </p><p>I should have heard it today, long before I </p><p>met you by the arroyo, had I not been trav- </p><p>eling through two big bands of Engle’s </p><p>sheep. I wonder if your medicine has cured </p><p>Ignacio?” </p><p> Behind them San Juan drawn into the</p><p>shadows of night but calling to them in </p><p>mellow-toned cadence of sorrow, before </p><p>them the somber canons and iron flanks of </p><p>Mt. Temple and somewhere still several </p><p>hours away Brocky Lane lying helpless and </p><p>perhaps hopeless; grim by day the earth </p><p>hereabouts was inscrutable by night, a </p><p>mighty, primal sphinx, lip-locked, spirit- </p><p>crushing. The man and girl riding swiftly </p><p>side by side felt in their different ways ac- </p><p>cording to their different characters and </p><p>previous experience the mute command laid </p><p>upon them and for the most part their lips </p><p>were hushed. </p><p> There came the first slopes, the talus of</p><p>strewn, broken, disintegrating rock and </p><p>then the first of the cliffs. Now the sheriff </p><p>rode in the fore and Virginia kept her frown- </p><p>ing eyes always upon his form leading the </p><p>way. They turned to the left, entered the </p><p>broad mouth of a ravine, found an uneven </p><p>trail, and were swallowed up by its utter and </p><p>impenetrable blackness. </p><p> “Give Persis her head,” Norton advised</p><p>her. “She’ll find her way and follow me.” </p><p> His voice, low-toned as it was, stabbe‘d</p><p>through the silence, startling her, coming </p><p>unexpectedly out of the void which had </p><p>drawn him and his horse gradually from the </p><p>reach of her straining eyes. She sighed, sat </p><p>back in her saddle, relaxed, loosened her reins. </p><p> For an hour they climbed almost steadily,</p><p>winding in and out, frequently riding five </p><p>hundred or a thousand feet to accomplish a </p><p>hundred of the distance toward Brocky </p><p>Lane. Now, high above the bed of the </p><p>gorge, the darkness had thinned about them; </p><p>more than once the girl saw the clear-cut</p><p>silhouette of man and beast in front of her </p><p>or swerving off to right or left. </p><p> When after a long time he spoke again he</p><p>was waiting for her to come up with him. </p><p>He had dismounted, loosened the cinch of </p><p>his saddle and tied his horse to a stunted, </p><p>twisted tree in a little flat. </p><p> “We have to go ahead on foot now,” he</p><p>told her as he put out his hand to help her </p><p>down. And then as they stood side by side, </p><p>“Tired much?” </p><p> “No,” she answered. “I was just in the</p><p>mood to ride. Which way now?” </p><p> He took down the tie-rope from her sad-</p><p>dle-strings, tied Persis a dozen paces from </p><p>his own horse and saying briefly, “This </p><p>way,” again went on. She kept her place </p><p>almost at his heels, now and again accepting </p><p>the hand he offered as their way grew </p><p>steeper underfoot. Half an hour ago she </p><p>knew that they had swerved off to the left, </p><p>away from the deep gorge into whose mouth </p><p>they had ridden so far below; now she saw </p><p>that they were once more drawing close to </p><p>the steep-walled canon. Its emptiness, </p><p>black and sinister, lay between them and a </p><p>group of bare peaks which were lifted like </p><p>cathedral spires against the sky. </p><p> “This would be simple enough in the</p><p>daytime,” Norton told her during one of </p><p>their brief pauses. “In the dark it’s an- </p><p>other matter. Not tired out are you?” </p><p> “No,” she assured him for the second</p><p>time, although long ago she would have </p><p>gladly thrown herself down to rest were their </p><p>errand any less imperative. </p><p> “We’ve got some pretty steep climbing</p><p>ahead of us yet,” he went on quietly. </p><p>“You’ve got to be careful not to slip. Oh,” </p><p>and he laughed carelessly, “you’d stop be- </p><p>fore you got to the bottom, but then a drop </p><p>of even half a dozen feet is no joke here. </p><p>If you’ll pardon me I’ll make sure for you.” </p><p> With no further apology or explanation</p><p>he slipped the end of a rope about her waist, </p><p>tying it in a hard knot. Until now she had </p><p>not even known that he had brought a </p><p>rope; now she wondered just how hazardous </p><p>the hidden trail was which they were trav-</p><p>eling; if it were in truth but the matter of </p><p>half a dozen feet which she would fall if she </p><p>slipped? He made the other end of the </p><p>short rope fast about his own body, said </p><p>“Ready?” and again she followed him </p><p>closely. </p><p> There came little flat spaces, then broken</p><p>boulders to clamber through and over, then </p><p>steep, rugged climbs when they grasped the </p><p>rough rocks with both hands and moved </p><p>on with painful slowness. It seemed to the </p><p>girl that they had been climbing for long, </p><p>tedious hours since they had slipped out of </p><p>their saddles; though to him she said noth- </p><p>ing, locking her lips stubbornly, she knew </p><p>that at last she was tired, very tired, that an </p><p>Abandoned in the Ice </p><p>63 </p><p>end of this laborious ascent must come soon </p><p>or she would be forced to stop and he down </p><p>and rest. </p><p> “Fifteen minutes,” said the sheriff, “and</p><p>we’re there. We’ll use the first five minutes </p><p>of it for a rest, too.” </p><p> He made her sit down, unstoppered a</p><p>canteen which, like the coil of rope, she did </p><p>not know he carried, and gave her a drink of </p><p>water which seemed to her the most wonder- </p><p>fully strength-making, life-giving draft in </p><p>the world. Then he dropped down at her </p><p>side, looked at his watch in the light of a </p><p>flaring match carefully cupped in his hand, </p><p>and lighted his pipe. </p><p> “Nearly midnight,” he told her.</p><p> Without replying she lay back against the</p><p>slope of the mountain, closed her eyes and </p><p>relaxed, breathing deeply. She was very </p><p>tired now, a moment ago her whole body </p><p>had been trembling to the long-continued </p><p>strain put upon her muscles. Her chest </p><p>expanded deeply to the long indrawn breath </p><p>which filled her lungs with the rare air. </p><p>She felt suddenly a little sleepy, dreaming </p><p>longingly of the unutterable content one </p><p>could find in just going to sleep with the </p><p>cliff-scarred mountainside for couch. </p><p> She stirred and opened her eyes. Rod</p><p>Norton, the sheriff of San Juan, a man who a </p><p>few brief hours ago had been unknown to </p><p>her, his name even strange, sat two paces </p><p>from her, smoking. She and this man of </p><p>whom she still knew rather less than nothing </p><p>were alone in the world; just the two of </p><p>them lifted into the sky, separated by a </p><p>dreary stretch of desert land from other </p><p>men and women—bound together by a bit </p><p>of rope. She tried to see his face; the pro- </p><p>file, more guessed than seen, appeared to her </p><p>fancy as hard and stern as the line of cliff </p><p>just beyond him, clear-cut against the sky. </p><p> Somehow—she did not definitely formu-</p><p>late the thought, she was at the time but </p><p>dimly, vaguely conscious of it—she was </p><p>glad that she had come to San Juan. And </p><p>she was not afraid of the silent man at her </p><p>side, not sorry that circumstance had given </p><p>them this night and its labors.</p><p> Norton knocked out his pipe. Together</p><p>they got to their feet. </p><p> “More careful than ever now,” he cau-</p><p>tioned her. “Look out for each step and go </p><p>slowly. We’re there in ten minutes. </p><p>Ready?” </p><p> “Ready,” she answered.</p><p> TO BE CONTINUED</p><p>ABANDONED IN THE ICE </p><p> BY CHART PITT</p><p> 'I 'HERE’S a blotch tonight on the snow-fields white,</p><p> And the frost-locked floe-bergs fret</p><p> ’Gainst the oaken sides where a whale-ship rides</p><p> With her frozen canvas set.</p><p> The star-frost sifts where she dreams and drifts</p><p> In the grip of a crystal sea—</p><p> But the buried trails of the bowhead whales</p><p> Urge her on through eternity.</p><p> There’s a scented breeze on the southern seas</p><p> Where her sister ships decay.</p><p> But she laughs at time in that frozen clime</p><p> Where the blinding blizzards play.</p><p> The auroras flare in the bitter air</p><p> Where the deadly ice-dust swirls—</p><p> Waking the fires of lost desires</p><p> In her cordage of crusted pearls.</p><p>PEARL/ or </p><p>GREAT </p><p>PRICE </p><p>\V'J </p><p>a, *•	-&gt;</p><p>~ A "M? </p><p> ' -'v</p><p>by </p><p>CKO </p><p> M::.</p><p>*'A- </p><p>j-Allan </p><p>Dunn </p><p>Author of “The Marooner,” “The Ferret and the Bet," etc. </p><p>OUIS BODIN, “Levuka Louis,” </p><p>and Jim Hurley, “Hawkbill </p><p>Hurley,” were: the two greatest </p><p>and most successful rogues in </p><p>the South Seas. </p><p> Ostensibly, the business of Bodin cen-</p><p>tered in his Levuka “Snuggery,” a top-chop </p><p>place of entertainment, bed and board for </p><p>none below the rank of mate or supercargo. </p><p>How much Louis owned, no one in </p><p>Melanesia knew, though many guessed. </p><p>Hurley possessed two or three copra plan- </p><p>tations, two schooners, a barkantine and a </p><p>launch—and liked to talk about them. </p><p>Bodin’s pudgy, dextrous fingers were in </p><p>many pies of which he invariably super- </p><p>intended the division. Both had brains but, </p><p>where Louis preferred finesse, Hurley was </p><p>apt to bluff. </p><p> Commerce was sluggish in Melanesia</p><p>since the commencement of the Great War. </p><p>The need of com had entirely eclipsed the </p><p>call for copra; tortoise shell—from the </p><p>hawkbill turtle—was no longer in demand. </p><p>China was in trouble and the trade in sea- </p><p>slugs—bSche-de-mer—languished. </p><p> Pearls? One can always sell pearls in</p><p>Tahiti—at a price. Louis had a pro- </p><p>prietary interest in certain pearl lagoons </p><p>but he was giving these varying proportions </p><p>of the seven years necessary rest between</p><p>cullings. The value of a gray pearl, or a </p><p>pink, any color outside of white, doubles </p><p>when such gems are matched. </p><p> According to Bodin’s philosophy, any fool</p><p>can make money when times are good. </p><p>In days like these, it took brains to gather </p><p>profit. He relaxed his purely physical </p><p>functions and concentrated his vitality in </p><p>his brain-cells. His bright eyes dulled </p><p>and his eyelids drooped as he lolled in his </p><p>bamboo chair on the shady veranda, a </p><p>native boy swaying a feather kahili to keep </p><p>away the flies. </p><p> There is a wireless at Levuka, which is</p><p>on the island of Oavalu, east of Viti Levu. </p><p>Louis had a radio station of his own with </p><p>which he issued his trade mandates and </p><p>gleaned the passing news of the air. Over </p><p>on the main island of the Fijis, on Viti Levu, </p><p>is Suva, capital and head of the resident </p><p>British Government. </p><p>64 </p><p>Pearls of Great Price </p><p>65 </p><p> The morning’s report was in Louis’ hand</p><p>and in it was the latest from Suva. It was </p><p>in code but Louis had deciphered it. As </p><p>an Ally he was in good standing with the </p><p>Government though sometimes suspected </p><p>of sailing overclose to the mark, not of </p><p>loyalty but of legality. </p><p> The French possessions in Melanesia,</p><p>outside of the Loyalties and the penal </p><p>settlement of New Caledonia, are negligible </p><p>and, at Levuka,'Louis was the king frog in a </p><p>puddle large enough for his activity. The </p><p>raiding of German colonies by British and </p><p>French cruisers was balm to Louis’ Alsatian </p><p>soul and the present item that such settle- </p><p>ments were being held jointly by English </p><p>and Gallic Governments until final dis- </p><p>tribution, furnished him pleasant food for </p><p>meditation. </p><p> The kahili waved on automatically. The</p><p>boy watched the rise and fall of the sash </p><p>that bound Louis’ generous stomach, a </p><p>ribbon of color between the spotless linen </p><p>of his trousers and the white silk of his </p><p>shirt. The master’s eyes seemed closed </p><p>but the diaphragmatic respiration was too </p><p>controlled for slumber. Tomi’s soul lusted </p><p>for a cool, green coconut with a surrepti- </p><p>tious slug of gin added thereto, but his soul </p><p>was in thrall to Bodin and he fanned on. </p><p> The languid figure came to action with a</p><p>smart clap of palms to which a second </p><p>loin-clad boy responded promptly. </p><p> “Hari, you take um canoe, ten men along</p><p>of you. You go Rewa on Viti Levu— </p><p>my word, better you walk along plenty </p><p>fast, go catch Kapitani Wells. You speak </p><p>him come along here Levuka way, plenty </p><p>quick, in his schooner.” </p><p> The kanaka vanished and Louis relaxed</p><p>again. He would have sent his fast launch </p><p>but the screw had fouled the top of a floating </p><p>coco-palm in the darkness and, until another </p><p>came from Suva, the craft was out of com- </p><p>mission. Behind lowered lids he visioned </p><p>the canoe speeding south and west with the </p><p>paddles blading briskly to a chant. A sligh t </p><p>sweat broke out on his olive features. The </p><p>sash rose and fell. So did the kahili. </p><p> “Tomi, suppose you stop along fan me</p><p>one lele second, my word, you plenty sorry. </p><p>Fanchon!” </p><p> A sleek-coated bull terrier trotted out</p><p>from a comer, yawning. </p><p> “Fanchon,” said Louis, still with closed</p><p>eyes. “You watch along this boy.” </p><p> Tomi looked at the bitch who ran out a</p><p>5 </p><p>pink tongue over ivory fangs and grinned </p><p>back at him, surveying him with eyes that </p><p>were very like her master’s. In the back </p><p>of his sluggish brain he registered a thought. </p><p> “Too much devil-smart this white fellow</p><p>boss along me,” and the kahili resumed its </p><p>regular, rhythmic sweep. </p><p>REWA is on the "eastern coast of </p><p>Viti Levu at the mouth of Rewa </p><p>River, fifty miles from Levuka. </p><p>In its higher reaches the idle fleet of Mela- </p><p>nesian traders lay where the fresh water </p><p>would arrest the bottom growth. </p><p> Hurley sat in the cockpit of his launch,</p><p>fishing for mullet at the turn of the tide. </p><p>Two fathoms below half a dozen baked </p><p>and split breadfruit had been spiked to </p><p>the bottom with sharp stakes, serving as </p><p>ground-bait to the silvery fish. </p><p> Breadfruit baited his hook and he was</p><p>just hauling in his eighth mullet when he </p><p>saw the canoe with Bodin’s head boy </p><p>steering, battle up-stream against the ebb; </p><p>make for the Akua, Wells’ schooner, </p><p>deliver a message that resulted in instant </p><p>activity aboard and then, their errand </p><p>completed, he watched the crew paddling </p><p>ashore to where a covey of kanakas were </p><p>basking in the mottled shade beneath a </p><p>clump of pandanus. There they would </p><p>rest and visit a while before returning. </p><p> The Akua was the fastest schooner in the</p><p>Fijis, bar one. That was Hurley’s flag- </p><p>ship, the Lehua, a Gloucester-fisherman </p><p>type. To maintain speed supremacy, Bodin </p><p>had bought his fast launch,the Fleur-de-Lys. </p><p>The launch in which Hurley was fishing </p><p>was but a small one, practically a tender, </p><p>with eight knots to the Fleur-de-Lys’ fifteen.</p><p>Hurley would have purchased a sixteen or </p><p>eighteen-knot power-boat had not times </p><p>been so dull and deliveries so uncertain. </p><p> How much Wells was owner of his</p><p>schooner, how large was Bodin’s interest, </p><p>Hurley only surmised. He knew that Wells </p><p>had been stranded at Levuka after the </p><p>wrecking of the trading barkantine of </p><p>which he was mate and that Bodin had </p><p>snapped up the smart young Yankee, </p><p>staked him to the Akua and given him </p><p>certain shares. </p><p> But any ripple of activity in these dull</p><p>times was worthy of attention. Bodin’s </p><p>movements invariably meant money in </p><p>sight and in these prospective profits Hurley </p><p>instantly determined to share. He ordered </p><p>66 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the kanaka with him in the launch to haul </p><p>in the anchor, started the engine and </p><p>puttered over to the Lehua. </p><p> “Billi, you take this bottle kini-kini (gin)</p><p>along those fellows. All same you hide </p><p>him, you tell them you make um steal, </p><p>you give um drink, find out from Hari </p><p>what for he come along see Kapitani Wells. </p><p>Bimeby you come back here plenty quick.” </p><p> His crafty boatswain grinned and made</p><p>his way ashore. Hurley shrilled on a </p><p>silver whistle and soon his own crew </p><p>assembled, got into their beached whale- </p><p>boat and boarded the Lehua. Hurley turned </p><p>to his mate. </p><p> “Brady, there’s something doing Levuka</p><p>way. I am going in with Billi in the launch. </p><p>Soon as the Akua clears, follow her out. </p><p>Split tacks with her and be off Kokua Head </p><p>at sunset. Keep inshore so they won’t </p><p>spot you from Levuka.” </p><p> Within fifteen minutes the Akua’s main-</p><p>sail was hoisted, the cable up, the head- </p><p>sheets taut and she swung to the ebb, </p><p>dropping down toward the mouth of Rewa </p><p>River. Hurley watched her foresail mount </p><p>as she caught and heeled to the trade and </p><p>reached for Oavalu and Levuka. </p><p> Ten minutes later Billi came aboard with</p><p>what news he could gather and Hurley took </p><p>him in the launch and started in a bee-^ie </p><p>for the Akua’s destination, his engine giving </p><p>him the power of disregarding wind and </p><p>current. When he made fast at the boat- </p><p>landing the schooner was inhauling sheets </p><p>for her final inshore tack. The Lehua was </p><p>not in sight. Sunset was an hour away. </p><p> “Billi,” said Hurley, “you go along</p><p>back of Levuka Louis’ place. Kapitani </p><p>Wells he come along bimeby, talk along </p><p>with Louis on back lanai, I think. When </p><p>he come ashore I make plenty talk with </p><p>him, maybe till dark I keep him. You hide </p><p>along bush in garden, listen what Louis </p><p>speak along of him. Then you come back </p><p>to Foo-Ching’s place—tell me everything. </p><p>Savvy?” </p><p> “I savvy plenty that haole (white) dog</p><p>along Levuka Louis. Suppose he savvy </p><p>me in bush I think he make kai-kai (eat).” </p><p> “You rub your self plenty frangipani</p><p>flower that dog no can tell. Now you walk </p><p>along.” </p><p> Billi went with the air of a martyr, but</p><p>he went. At sunset the Lehua crept out </p><p>from the reef behind Kokua Head and </p><p>sneaked offshore in the dusk. Hurley, </p><p>drinking gin rickies at Foo-Ching’s, awaited </p><p>the result of Billi’s mission, wishing that he </p><p>himself could have wormed into the garden </p><p>as quietly as the kanaka, and Billi, his body </p><p>smeared with the crushed petals of pungent </p><p>frangipani, crouched in the crotons under </p><p>the veranda where Louis talked with Wells. </p><p>Fanchon was there too, drowsily uncon- </p><p>scious of any intruder. </p><p>“SO,” SAID Louis, “you wish to </p><p>enlist now that America is one of </p><p>the Allies. It is good. I under- </p><p>stand that well. But listen, mon ami. It </p><p>will be long before you can get back to </p><p>the States, by that time the war may be </p><p>over. Suppose it is not, what then? You </p><p>enlist—in what? You—a first-class sailing </p><p>master, will you try to make of yourself a </p><p>private or become a Jackie aboard a cruiser? </p><p> “I, too would serve France, old as I am.</p><p>But brain is better than muscle, mon brave, </p><p>and it is in my mind that we can help the </p><p>cause here in the Fijis. I have a plan </p><p>which should bring much money at the </p><p>expense of those pigs of Germans. And </p><p>money always wins. This money, mon </p><p>ami, we will send to aid our braves at the </p><p>front. If you will, you shall take it pres- </p><p>ently and tell them it is a gift from Louis </p><p>Bodin, once of Alsace, now of the Fijis, a </p><p>gift from Levuka Louis and yourself. </p><p> “It will do you no harm to be such a</p><p>messenger. It is in my mind that they will </p><p>need good master-mariners. Perhaps we </p><p>will build with this money a little, quick </p><p>ship, with you in command, to go hunting </p><p>these sharks of U-boats, nom de guerre, that </p><p>would be better than drill for six months </p><p>to learn in which end of the gun fits the </p><p>bayonet, non?” </p><p> Wells, curved of nose, lantern of jaw,</p><p>nodded. Billi yawned in the crotons. This</p><p>sort of talk was all words and idle. </p><p> “Tell me about it,” said Wells. “It</p><p>sounds good to me.” </p><p> “In Melanesia,” said Louis, “Great</p><p>Britain owns twenty-one thousand square </p><p>miles of islands, France seven and a half </p><p>and Germany seventy-eight thousand— </p><p>or she did. Now she owns nothing. It is </p><p>spoils of war. By and by France and En- </p><p>gland will divide. Meanwhile, what hap- </p><p>pens? The German plantations go back </p><p>to the bush for lack of men and the pearl </p><p>lagoons lie untouched.” </p><p> “All,” said Wells softly. “Pearls.”</p><p>Pearls of Great Price </p><p>6 7 </p><p> In the crotons Billi’s ears pricked up like</p><p>a dog’s—like Fanchon’s who was beginning </p><p>to sniff uneasily. </p><p> “Northeast of New Mecklenburg in the</p><p>German Solomons, there is an atoll that is </p><p>ripe for gathering. It has not been touched </p><p>for six years and the shell is very rich. I </p><p>will give you the position later, on paper. </p><p>Figures talked to the air find wings, and </p><p>Fanchon is uneasy. What is it, Fanchon?” </p><p>Billi was no fool. In the few words last </p><p>spoken he had gathered the reason of Wells’ </p><p>trip, to get the pearls from the German </p><p>atoll. He sensed too that, in the hot </p><p>evening, his own personal odor was master- </p><p>ing that of the fragrant blossoms suffi- </p><p>ciently for the dog to detect it. It was time </p><p>to be moving.' He started to crawl away </p><p>on his belly, silently as a snake. </p><p> But, as he sinuously stretched, from the</p><p>exposed armpit glands the telltale kanaka </p><p>scent permeated the breeze, to the indig- </p><p>nant offense of Fanchon’s quivering nostrils. </p><p>Without waste of growl the dog’s lithe body </p><p>rippled over the railing of the lanai and </p><p>crashed into the crotons from which the </p><p>body of Billi shot, spurred by fear of fangs. </p><p> Wells arose, half drawing his automatic</p><p>from its holster, but Louis laughed. </p><p> “Let Fanchon obtain some exercise, mon</p><p>ami” he said. 11 Norn d’un nom, see the </p><p>kanaka run.” </p><p> Across the lawn, leaping the shrubbery</p><p>spread-eagled, Billi fled like a shadow in </p><p>the dusk, the gray streak of Fanchon at </p><p>his heels. They vanished in the palms </p><p>that bordered the wild bush. There was </p><p>a shriek, a yelp of triumph from Fanchon </p><p>and presently the bull terrier came trotting </p><p>back and laid a fragment of cloth at her </p><p>master’s feet. Billi had hurled himself </p><p>into a mass of jungle too dense for Fanchon </p><p>to tackle. But she had drawn blood and </p><p>obtained a trophy and was content to leave </p><p>Billi struggling in the tangle. </p><p> Louis picked up the bit of cloth. It was</p><p>a strip of yellow muslin, nearly new, bright </p><p>yellow with purple and red circles inter- </p><p>twined for pattern. He passed it to Wells.</p><p> “That came out of Hurley’s trade-room,”</p><p>said the latter. “He has passed out two </p><p>hundred fathoms of the stuff. No one else </p><p>has it.” </p><p> “It does not surprise me,” said Louis.</p><p>“He came ashore in his launch half an hour </p><p>ahead of the Akua.” </p><p> “And kept me chinning on the beach</p><p>about the war till it was nearly dark,” </p><p>said Wells. “I left him at Ching-Foo’s on </p><p>the way up.” </p><p> “One of his boys will steer standing for a</p><p>while,” said Louis. “Let us go inside. It </p><p>is warmer but more private.” </p><p> “This is the news I got from Suva,” said</p><p>Louis presently. “The Solomons are in </p><p>charge of the dual Governments of France </p><p>and England. The British resident will </p><p>assume charge from Bougainville. The </p><p>French gunboat Leopard will proceed from </p><p>New Caledonia and inform the natives. </p><p>It is doubtful if she will touch at our atoll. </p><p>She must not hear your little plan. Also </p><p>Hurley must not dip his fingers in this bowl </p><p>of poi. He will try—which makes the game </p><p>more interesting than solitaire.” </p><p> Louis chuckled.</p><p> “You will provision tonight and go out</p><p>on the ebb an hour before dawn. Do not </p><p>wait to rot the pearls. The smell might </p><p>prove traitor down the wind. Better to </p><p>lose a few. You will find the best shell </p><p>at the north end of the lagoon. Come to </p><p>see me as soon as the tide turns. I shall </p><p>be awake. I fancy Hurley may pay me a </p><p>little visit and perhaps he will show some </p><p>of his cards. He is a little fond of telling </p><p>what he holds. Here is the position. Eh </p><p>bien, mon ami, au revoir.” </p><p> As Wells left him, the dapper little</p><p>Frenchman, half pirate, half patriot, bent </p><p>to scratch Fanchon behind the ears. </p><p> “So, you did not eat him, dog of my heart?</p><p>Kanaka kai-kai is not to your liking. But </p><p>you nipped him, eh? Nipped him in the </p><p>breech. For that you get a better piece of </p><p>meat, Fanchon.” </p><p>r^l AT NINE o’clock a sulky and sub- </p><p>I dued Billi arrived at Ching-Foo’s </p><p>» ITwiI with a furrowed flank and received </p><p>first aid in the smart of carbolic acid, fol- </p><p>lowed by peroxide, with an emollient in the </p><p>shape of a bottle of square-face. Hurley </p><p>was more than complaccnt at the news of </p><p>the pearl atoll and took to the beach with </p><p>a shirt-pocket full of cigars to work out the </p><p>problem as he walked. </p><p> He and Bodin reasoned much alike.</p><p>Both tried to look at situations first through </p><p>the eyes of the other, then their own, playing </p><p>the game several moves ahead and figuring </p><p>all contingencies they could conceive. </p><p> If Louis’ launch was in commission,</p><p>Hurley was undone. His schooner could </p><p>68 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>not follow. But he could trail the Akua. </p><p>The joker in the pack was the position of </p><p>the island. He had a plan for getting that </p><p>but it meant taking Ching-Foo into part </p><p>confidence and partnership. At the worst </p><p>he could warn the French cruiser through </p><p>the British Government at Suva. That </p><p>would net him nothing save the dis- </p><p>comfiture of Louis and he was playing for </p><p>stakes—not just for the game. One thing, </p><p>however, he resolved. If he could not get </p><p>in on the pearls, Louis should not. </p><p> The news that Bodin had pirated from the</p><p>aerograms had by this time reached Ching- </p><p>Foo. Hurley gave tribute to Louis for the </p><p>inspiration of the idea. He himself could </p><p>not especially share Louis’ patriotic fervor </p><p>in spoiling the Egyptians by using German </p><p>pearls to fight them with the proceeds of </p><p>sale. To Hurley, in South Sea ethics of </p><p>mine and thine, the pearls were legitimate </p><p>trove for the first finder. His financial </p><p>horizon was largely bounded by the rim of </p><p>the dollar. </p><p> As the butt of his second cigar hissed into</p><p>the surf-line he resolved upon his first move. </p><p>He would go and see Bodin. Louis had </p><p>been right when he told Wells that Hurley </p><p>liked to assist his bluffs by hinting at the </p><p>cards he held. Louis knew that Billi, or </p><p>one of Hurley’s boys, had been listening. </p><p>Hurley valued rightly the episode of Fanchon </p><p>and the missing square from Billi’s loin-cloth. </p><p> Louis would know that Hurley knew</p><p>the main factor of his scheme. Louis would </p><p>know that, in the Lehua, with the moon in </p><p>her third quarter and rising early, Hurley </p><p>could follow the Akua wherever she went, </p><p>night or day. With these aces already </p><p>in his hand he might persuade Louis to </p><p>split the pot. </p><p> A random thought of trying to take the</p><p>pearls by force from Wells after the latter </p><p>had harvested them and was on the way </p><p>home, Hurley dismissed. He had run up </p><p>against Wells before and the New En- </p><p>glander was not to be bluffed. If it came </p><p>to a fight for the possession of what the </p><p>Government would consider illegal treasure, </p><p>Wells would give as good as he received. </p><p> Hurley lit a third cigar and wandered</p><p>to the Snuggery. </p><p> Louis received him affably.</p><p> “Here’s to better times,” pledged Hurley.</p><p> “Of a truth,” replied Louis. “Present</p><p>times are dull, eh, mon brave?” </p><p> Wells spent no time shuffling the deck.</p><p>In his walk to the Snuggery he had learned </p><p>that the Akua was provisioning. His own </p><p>schooner was fairly well stocked, lacking </p><p>only water, and that he had ordered </p><p>supplied. If he had to chase Wells the </p><p>latter would soon see the hopelessness of </p><p>trying to get away and Louis might tire of </p><p>the delay. </p><p> He looked into the Frenchman’s smiling</p><p>eyes and read that Louis had also gone over </p><p>the situation. Between men of their caliber </p><p>sparring was a waste of time. </p><p> “Few good things going now, Louis,”</p><p>said Hurley. “When one breaks we should </p><p>all be willing to share it.” </p><p>“Why, mon ami?” returned Louis evenly. </p><p>“Square thing to do. Besides, what is </p><p>the use of blocking one another? Partners </p><p>don’t trump aces unless they are fools.” </p><p>“Of a truth. Even Fanchon knows that. </p><p>Eh, my cabbage? The dog sleeps. She </p><p>has been running and is tired. Have you a </p><p>proposition to make to me, mon ami?” </p><p>Incidentally his hand strayed to where a </p><p>piece of cloth lay on the table beneath a </p><p>cigar box. Hurley grinned at the gesture. </p><p> “Sure have I, Louis. You’re on to a</p><p>good thing right now. Let me in on it.” </p><p>“Or you will block my hand?” </p><p> “I’d rather be partners, Louis.”</p><p> “But this enterprise is not my own.</p><p>The proceeds are not to go to me.” </p><p> Hurley laughed.</p><p>“I suppose not. Going to give them to </p><p>charity? The Widows and Orphans Fund?” </p><p>Bodin regarded him silently for a second </p><p>or two. His eyes brightened and dimmed. </p><p> “The widows and orphans? Mon Dieu,</p><p>Hurlee, that is not a bad idea. I thank </p><p>you. I had not thought of that. An </p><p>excellent idea, truly. But in any event </p><p>I can not share this with you.” </p><p> Hurley flicked the ash from his cigar</p><p>and his eyes got steely. </p><p> “You will share it, Louis, or I’ll copper</p><p>it. I’m on to the scheme. Piracy, that’s </p><p>what it practically amounts to. Not that </p><p>I give a whoop about that-” </p><p> “Providing you share the loot, mon ami.”</p><p> “Exactly. As I say, I’m on to it.”</p><p> “And you want-”</p><p> “Half. I’ll do the work. You can dish</p><p>Wells. You own him. Half—or-” </p><p> “Or what, monsieur?”</p><p> “Or nothing. Either let me in on it or</p><p>I’ll let myself in. You know me, Bodin, </p><p>I'm no slack-brained copra-cadger. You’re </p><p>Pearls' of Great Price </p><p>69 </p><p>clever but I’m no fool. And there’s no </p><p>time to lose. What do you say?” </p><p> “Not one pearl, Hurlee, not one little,</p><p>tiny baroque.” </p><p> “You think you’ve got an ace in the hole</p><p>because you know the location. But I </p><p>know what you are after and you’ll have </p><p>a-of a time shaking me off.” </p><p> “I know what you are drawing to, mon</p><p>ami. You say I have an ace in the hole. </p><p>I may have two. I am playing a good hand, </p><p>Hurlee.” </p><p> “There’ll be a show-down for the pot.”</p><p>Hurley rose, choleric but mastering his </p><p>chagrin at the twinkle in Bodin’s eyes. </p><p> Fanchon got up and sniffed gingerly</p><p>at his heels to the door, standing to watch </p><p>him before she went back to her master. </p><p> “That settles it,” said Hurley to himself.</p><p>“Widows and orphans!” he exploded aloud. </p><p>“Does that Frenchy think I am a fool? </p><p>Share with him? Not much. Either I </p><p>rake it all in or he loses.” </p><p> In the Snuggery Louis sipped at his</p><p>vermouth. His eyes had dimmed again </p><p>and he saw the ravaged villages of France, </p><p>the weeping women and the wondering, </p><p>frightened children. </p><p> “Pour les veuves et les orphelins, Fanchon,”</p><p>he murmured. “Par le bon Dieu, c’est une </p><p>bonne idee.” </p><p>AN HOUR before midnight, Hur- </p><p>ley, in his launch chugged out to </p><p>where the Lehua awaited him and </p><p>the schooner passed over the rim of the </p><p>horizon and patrolled on long tacks until </p><p>the dawn showed the Akua leaving Levuka </p><p>behind her, off for the Solomons. </p><p> At noon Wells gave up the attempt to</p><p>shake off a swifter opponent and the two </p><p>returned as they had sailed for hours, on </p><p>the same tack, like evenly matched cup </p><p>racers—only Wells had known that Hurley </p><p>was deliberately sailing a point farther off</p><p>the wind than he had to when they were </p><p>close-hauled, and had as deliberately slack- </p><p>ened his sheets when they reached, with </p><p>half a knot of superior speed ever ready to </p><p>be let out upon occasion. </p><p> “Never mind, mon brave,” said Louis</p><p>when Wells reported. “We v^jll lead him </p><p>on the chase of the wild goose for a day or </p><p>two. My propeller arrives from Suva on </p><p>the Manu, Thursday. Then we shall see.” </p><p>“What’s the matter with Hurley getting </p><p>on to that too?” said Wells. “He knows </p><p>all about the accident and where you are </p><p>getting the new screw. He’ll see it when </p><p>it comes. He’ll play some trick. Tip the </p><p>tiling off to the Government, likely.” </p><p> “If he does that,” said Louis, “we will</p><p>have to make a race of it with the Leopard. </p><p>She can not make better than ten knots. </p><p>You will have to stop at the Hebrides, at </p><p>Malaita and maybe at Choiseul to get fresh </p><p>gasoline for her tank and carry extra drums. </p><p>See always you have plenty of gasoline, </p><p>Wells, if we use the Fleur-de-Lys. I have </p><p>no fancy to see her smashed by a shell, </p><p>or you on New Caledonia. But I do not </p><p>think Hurlee will inform—not until le </p><p>dernier resort. We shall see what we shall </p><p>see. In the meantime, mon ami, let us </p><p>prepare for emergencies. I have something </p><p>to show you. Also you can rot out the </p><p>shell.” </p><p> When Wells arrived aboard his schooner</p><p>he wore a broad smile. </p><p> “Tim,” he said to his supercargo,</p><p>“Bodin’s the father of all the foxes.” </p><p> Tim Donnelly grinned.</p><p> “He’s a whole kennel of foxes. ’Tis</p><p>myself could have told you that,” he said. </p><p>“Levuka Louis was born with a wishbone </p><p>in his mouth an’ he chewed the nipples of </p><p>his milk bottles to rags with his wisdom </p><p>teeth whin he was yet a babe in ar-r-ms. </p><p>Don’t be tellin’me anything about Bodin.” </p><p> Twice more the Akua put to sea and</p><p>twice more the Lehua trailed her out and </p><p>back. Then the inter-island steamer Manu </p><p>came and brought a new propeller for Bodin, </p><p>to the knowledge of all Levuka. And </p><p>Hurley took counsel with Ching-Foo.</p><p> That evening the Akua went to sea once</p><p>more, and once again the Lehua trailed her, </p><p>hanging to her quarter league after league </p><p>like a wolf on the trail of a wounded caribou. </p><p>But Wells was not aboard the half-manned </p><p>Akua nor Hurley on the Lehua. The first </p><p>was closeted with Bodin in his Snuggery </p><p>and the second sneaked aboard the Manu </p><p>from a shore-boat and took passage to Suva. </p><p> Twenty-four hours later the launch</p><p>Fleur-de-Lys passed through the reef </p><p>entrance with a smother of foam at her </p><p>sharp bows. Fifty miles offshore Wells </p><p>saw the topsails of0 the two schooners </p><p>returning to Levuka. </p><p> “It looks like clear sailing, Tim,” he</p><p>said. </p><p> “There’s one thing ye should rimimber,”</p><p>answered Donnelly. “Louis is a fox, but </p><p>70 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Hurley, bad ’cess to him, is a wolf. Sure, </p><p>that engine runs like a watch, Skipper. </p><p>What are we making?” </p><p> “A trifle better than seventeen, Tim.</p><p>Are all the arms aboard?” </p><p> “Guns and cartridges—not forgettin’</p><p>a stick or two of dynnymite for luck. </p><p> “The boat’s a beauty,” said Wells half</p><p>regretfully. “It’s a pity she hasn’t got </p><p>sticks in her. But she makes the time, </p><p>and time is the essence of this contract.” </p><p> fgfeteJ DAWN rolled up the sky almost as</p><p>swiftly as a spring blind jumps to </p><p>the release and floods a room with </p><p>ight. The pearl atoll lay revealed upon </p><p>the sea, sapphire to the reef and emerald </p><p>within; clean cut as an etching, the palm- </p><p>fronds waving in the morning breeze. The </p><p>Fleur-de-Lys lay at anchor in the outer </p><p>lagoon. There were two of these in hour- </p><p>glass shape; the unlovely Teutonic name </p><p>of the atoll was Pretzel Isle. </p><p> A thin thread of smoke wavered in the</p><p>wind from a fire on the beach where Wells, </p><p>with Donnelly and a crew of twelve men </p><p>from the complement of the Akua, were </p><p>preparing to enjoy a farewell breakfast. </p><p> A heap of shells proclaimed their indus-</p><p>try. Gems that could not be held in a pint </p><p>measure attested the richness of the fishing. </p><p> They had been there for ten busy days.</p><p>Already the oyster meat, despoiled of </p><p>pearls, was beginning to rot and taint the </p><p>leeward air. And, so far, there had been </p><p>no hint of disturbance. </p><p> The meal was leisurely finished and the</p><p>crew prepared to gather fresh coconuts for </p><p>the return trip. Six of them set strips </p><p>of cloth about their middles and hitched </p><p>themselves up the slender trunks. Wells </p><p>lit his pipe and Donnelly busied himself to </p><p>oversee the lading. </p><p> Unseen, unheard, unsuspected, a launch,</p><p>painted white, with a buff funnel, one gilt </p><p>letter at the bows, the tricolor of France </p><p>trailing in the wind of her going, glided</p><p>round the atoll, hidden by the palms and </p><p>pandanus scrub until it had fairly entered </p><p>the mouth of the outer lagoon. A puff of </p><p>smoke came from a gun in her bows. </p><p> Wells jumped to his feet; his hand swung</p><p>to his hip and fell as he saw the ensign </p><p>and the jackets of the French marines who </p><p>charged up the beach, their bayonets </p><p>gleaming. An officer ran with them, re- </p><p>volver in hand, lanyarded to his wrist. </p><p>The kanakas slid down the palms and </p><p>gathered open-mouthed. Donnelly swore. </p><p> “That dirty wolf of a Hurley,” he said.</p><p>“The informin’ thief of the world.” </p><p> Wells knocked the ashes from his pipe</p><p>and grimly faced the officer. </p><p> “Parlez vous Franqais?” demanded the</p><p>latter. </p><p> “I do not,” answered Wells shortly.</p><p>“Then I will spik English. This island </p><p>is the property of France an’ Great Britain. </p><p>You have poach pearl. Those pearl I </p><p>deman’.” </p><p> “Diwle a pearl did we get,” said Don-</p><p>nelly. “Some one was ahead of us—a chap </p><p>named Hurley.” </p><p> “Hurlee I know not,” said the officer.</p><p>“But you he. Regard those shells. Would </p><p>you open so many for nothing? Bah! Give </p><p>me those pearl an’ I leave you with warning. </p><p>I have nqt room for you in my launch, an’ </p><p>I must return to my ship. Refuse—I towyou </p><p>all an’ then—” he shrugged his shoulders— </p><p>“New Caledonia is not healthy, mon ami.” </p><p>“If I give you the pearls,” said Wells </p><p>resignedly, “you will leave us here?” </p><p> “Those are my ordaire. We know where</p><p>from you come, messieurs; we shall keep the </p><p>eye on you. Now we are ver’ busy, too </p><p>busy for prisonnaires. Perhaps you will </p><p>soon fight for France an’ Englan’ an’ this </p><p>shall be forgotten.” </p><p> “I am an American citizen,” said Wells.</p><p>“I am going to enlist.” </p><p> “Me too,” said Donnelly.</p><p> “Bien. But now, those pearl.”</p><p> With a wry grimace Wells took off his</p><p>belt. It was lined with chamois leather </p><p>pouches designed for gold but now he </p><p>emptied from them into the husk of a </p><p>coconut a pint of shimmering globules, </p><p>rounded, gleaming with all the tender hues </p><p>of dawn. The officer poured them into a </p><p>leather pouch he produced from his uniform </p><p>and stowed them away. </p><p> “I must observe your gasoline,” said the</p><p>Frenchman. “Come to your launch.” </p><p>Protestingly Wells went with them and </p><p>watched them half empty the tank. </p><p> “This will hardly take me to New</p><p>Mecklenburg,” he grumbled. “And when </p><p>I start to get more they’ll pinch us.” </p><p> Once more the officer shrugged.</p><p> “Ordaire, messieurs. You should have</p><p>think of that before you play corsair. You </p><p>have the chance to go where you like. </p><p>I wish you bon voyage. Au revoir.” </p><p>Pearls of Great Price </p><p>71 </p><p> The marines reentered the trim boat</p><p>and the ravished pearl-gatherers watched </p><p>her vanish around the atoll. </p><p> “We should have think of that before,”</p><p>mimicked Donnelly. “You aren’t as smart </p><p>as you think you are, Frenchy Frog-Eater. </p><p>Hari, you start um boys dig up those drums </p><p>of gasoline. We’ll not put in at Mecklen- </p><p>burg this trip. What’s the idea, Skipper?” </p><p>“We ought to have made that chap give </p><p>us a receipt for the pearls, Tim.” </p><p> “Fat chance. Why?”</p><p> “Did you see his eyes? He has</p><p>handled pearls before. I wouldn’t wonder </p><p>if some of them were missing when he turns </p><p>them over.” </p><p> “It won’t be makin’ any diffirince to us</p><p>now,” said Tim. </p><p> “No,” said Wells, relighting his pipe.</p><p>“Get those nuts aboard and we’ll clear out.” </p><p>IT WAS six weeks later when </p><p>Hurley came to Levuka on the </p><p>Manu and went up to the Snuggery </p><p>with the officers of the steamer and the </p><p>passengers. He was arrayed in linen and </p><p>silk, and he led the procession. </p><p> “The drinks are on me, Louis,” he said.</p><p>“Take the orders. Presently you may buy.” </p><p>He smiled at his audience who scented a </p><p>joke. The deft boys served them. </p><p> “Here’s to success, Louis,” said Hurley.</p><p> Bodin bowed and raised his glass.</p><p> “If you will pardon me, gentlemen, I will</p><p>drink to La France. And to the widows </p><p>and orphans,” he added, in an aside to </p><p>Hurley, as the guests rose to the toast. </p><p>Hurley glanced at Louis and grinned. </p><p>“Are you in the market for pearls, </p><p>Louis?” he asked. </p><p> “Perhaps. Have you any? I will look</p><p>at them presently,” replied Louis. </p><p> “Want to do business in private? All</p><p>right; that suits me. But the drinks are </p><p>on you, Louis, take my word for it.”</p><p>The glasses were replenished. Louis rose. </p><p>“I give you, messieurs,” he said, “the </p><p>widows and orphans of our united armies.” </p><p>Once more the toast was taken standing. </p><p>“And now, Hurlee,” said Louis. </p><p> He led the way to his private room and</p><p>Hurley followed with a shoulder grin at </p><p>the crowd. As Louis shut the door Hurley </p><p>reached into the inner pocket of his coat, </p><p>disclosing the slung holster of an auto- </p><p>matic. From a leather pouch he poured </p><p>on to a black silk neckerchief a pint of </p><p>pearls. Louis bent 'gravely over them. </p><p> “They are very pretty,” he said.</p><p> Hurley threw back his head and laughed.</p><p>“Louis, you are a game sport. I am </p><p>almost tempted to divvy with you. </p><p>Almost, not quite. Why don’t you ask </p><p>me where they came from? Or has Wells </p><p>got back in the Fleur-de-Lys?” </p><p> “He has arrived and gone away again,”</p><p>said Louis. “To the States. On the </p><p>Mariposa. So you need not tell me where </p><p>these came from, my friend. I have </p><p>guessed. One thing I do not know. How </p><p>did you get the position of the atoll?” </p><p>“Game, Louis! You’re a game loser. </p><p>I’ll let you cheat me on the price for that. </p><p>The position? Wells’ cook is part pa-ke </p><p>(Chinese). I sicked Ching-Foo on to him. </p><p>He went through Wells’ clothes when he </p><p>was asleep. Simple enough?” </p><p> “Only you have to share with Ching-Foo.</p><p>That is too bad.” </p><p> “There is plenty to go around, I reckon.</p><p>What are they worth, Louis? Or rather, </p><p>what will you give me for them?” </p><p> “I overlooked the cook,” said Louis,</p><p>ignoring the request for the moment. “You </p><p>took that trick, mon brave." </p><p> “I took all of them, Louis. I told you I</p><p>held the best hand. You should have seen </p><p>Wells’ face when they asked him for the </p><p>pearls.” </p><p> “You were there?”</p><p> “In the cabin of the launch. We fixed</p><p>it up for a man-of-war tender. Renault</p><p>from Suva was the officer. He used to be </p><p>an actor once. We only just got there on </p><p>time, Louis. But we should have cut you </p><p>off on the way back.” </p><p> “Renault from Suva,” said Louis softly.</p><p>“I shall remember that name. So the </p><p>rrrttrines were not real, eh Hurley? That </p><p>was very clever of you.” </p><p> “Fakes, every one of them,” said Hurley.</p><p>“Outside of Renault not one of the bunch </p><p>knew a word of French. How about the </p><p>pearls?” A gleam came into Louis’ eyes. </p><p> “Fakes every one of them, mon ami.</p><p>They cost me sixty dollars a long time ago. </p><p>Made in Melbourne, Hurlee. I will give </p><p>you sixty dollars for them. The real ones </p><p>were hidden in the Fleur-de-Lys. I bought </p><p>them myself, on speculation, for twenty </p><p>thousand dollars. Wells has the money </p><p>with him, to give to widows and orphans. </p><p>Never mind the gun, Hurlee. Be a good </p><p>loser.

The label </p><p>across the top resembles this— </p><p>TOLIP KCOREPIP EHT </p><p>The rest of the page is smears and blots. </p><p>“Looks like a Russian proclamation, </p><p>Buck,” says I. “Where did it come from?” </p><p>“Right here, Ike; that ex-pardner of </p><p>yours published it.” </p><p> “Magpie?” I asks, and they both nods.</p><p>“That’s his first edition,” replies Buck. </p><p>“He took over the office when a few of the </p><p>local boys ran the editor across the border </p><p>for slandering the community.

All I</p><p>can see is the bottom of his boots, the seat of </p><p>his pants and his elbows—the rest of him </p><p>is behind a newspaper, as he leans back in a </p><p>chair, with his feet on the table. </p><p> I leans against the table and rolls a</p><p>smoke. He glances at me, switches his </p><p>cigaret over to the other side of his mouth, </p><p>and goes on trying to read. I say “trying </p><p>to read” for the reason that he’s got a paper </p><p>he printed himself. </p><p> Pretty soon he yawns and lays the paper</p><p>across his knees. </p><p> “Ike,” says he, “that’s some paper.”</p><p>“Some ink, too, if that’s anything to brag </p><p>about,” I replies. “When did you learn </p><p>to write Russian?

I’m glad to see you, too.” </p><p>“Accumulate anything on your trip, Ike?” </p><p>“Wood-ticks, fool-hens and a growing </p><p>conviction that rich rock is scarce. How’s </p><p>things at the sheriff’s office?” </p><p> “Tolable, Ike. Won by a narrow major-</p><p>ity. I reckon if Abe had a lived we’d ’a’ </p><p>needed a recount. Lot of folks voted for </p><p>him after he was dead.” </p><p> “They would,” I agrees. “Lot of folks</p><p>around here ain’t got no more ambition </p><p>than to vote for a corpse. How comes it </p><p>you’re a editor? Has all the bad-men died </p><p>off or has a moral wave hit Piperock?” </p><p> “I always been a critter of circumstance,</p><p>Ike,” he states, unfolding his long legs, </p><p>and easing his gun handy-like. “I always </p><p>been a disciple of advance, and I’ve worn</p><p>all the skin off my shoulder trying to give </p><p>the wheels of progress a lift. At times them </p><p>wheels have slipped and sprained my im- </p><p>mediate future, but I never peeped. </p><p> “When this here misguided editor fades</p><p>across the horizon, me, being sheriff, appro- </p><p>priates this here plant and opines to run it </p><p>as a public institution. There’s twenty-five </p><p>sheets of paper left and one can of ink. </p><p>My first edition takes twelve sheets, and </p><p>I hereby claims that a man, without no </p><p>experience, what can rise to the occasion </p><p>and put out a paper like that is a credit </p><p>to the community.” </p><p> “Didn’t you have trouble finding all</p><p>them letters, Magpie?” </p><p> “Trouble? Say, the ends of my fingers</p><p>74 </p><p> Adventure</p><p>are so tender I can hold out my hands </p><p>and feel the sun slide behind the hills. The </p><p>next publication is problematical, Ike. </p><p>I’m short of material, but I only figures </p><p>on one more issue. I got a article set up, </p><p>and I can’t publish until the time is </p><p>ripe.” </p><p> “Something special?”</p><p> “Uh-huh. ‘Tombstone’ Todd’s obituary.”</p><p>“From Wilier Crick?” I asks, and Magpie </p><p>nods. </p><p> “Uh-huh. Him and ‘Cactus’ Collins</p><p>comes over here to help elect Abe Anderson, </p><p>being as Abe was a relative. When Abe </p><p>departs this here vale of tears they up and </p><p>proclaims they’re a pair of howling wolves, </p><p>and that they’re a permanent fixture around </p><p>here until such a time as they lays me on </p><p>my back and gestures over me with a spade. </p><p>Awful pair of gobblers, Ike.” </p><p> “Why not an obituary for Cactus, too,</p><p>Magpie?” </p><p> “He’s hiding out until such a time as</p><p>his stummick is normal, Ike. He horns in </p><p>on me yesterday, and gets pessimistic to my </p><p>face. I’m busy on that obituary and don’t </p><p>like to be interrupted, so I beats him on </p><p>the draw, accepts his gun as a subscription </p><p>and induces him to eat a bucket of paste. </p><p>Awful smelling mess, Ike. I’d opine that </p><p>as far as my future horoscope is concerned </p><p>his lips are sealed.” </p><p> “Thirteen sheets and one obituary will</p><p>be something to print,” says I. “Has Tomb- </p><p>stone made any advances?” </p><p> “Once. I was standing over there by the</p><p>window, holding up one of them dinguses </p><p>what contains type, when a bullet comes </p><p>along and hits her plumb center. She </p><p>collapses right there and ruins things. </p><p>Some of that lead type enters my bosom, </p><p>and for the space of a foot square on my </p><p>manly chest I looks like a smallpox patient. </p><p>This idea of being a man of letters ain’t no </p><p>prosaic pastime, Ike.” </p><p>JUST then “Scenery” Sims darkens </p><p>our doorway. Scenery is knee-high</p><p>to a short Injun, and his voice </p><p>hankers for oil. He looks mean-like at </p><p>me and Magpie, and chaws some indus- </p><p>trious. Pretty soon he expectorates copi- </p><p>iously on the floor, and orates— </p><p> “YVant to quit taking the paper.”</p><p>Magpie snaps out his gun and covers </p><p>Scenery. </p><p> “Get down on your knees and wipe out</p><p>that-spot!” snorts Magpie. “What do </p><p>yuh think this is—a corral?” </p><p> “I—uh—” begins Scenery, but the gun</p><p>don’t waver, so he takes the handkerchief </p><p>off his neck, and scrubs our floor. </p><p> “This is a newspaper-office, Scenery,”</p><p>states Magpie. “You can’t start your </p><p>oration with a cloud-burst in here. Sabe? </p><p>What you got against the paper, and </p><p>whyfor don’t yuh wish it no more?” </p><p> “I can’t read her,” he squeaks. “She’s</p><p>too backward to suit me. Of course I— </p><p>uh—well, send her along, and I’ll—uh—do </p><p>the best I can. I got to go now.” </p><p> He slips out with his hat in his hand,</p><p>and lopes off up the street. </p><p> “That’s business, Ike,” laughs Magpie.</p><p>“I’m going to make ’em like it.” </p><p> “When yuh had the drop on him yuh</p><p>ought to ’a ’collected in advance for another </p><p>year,” says I. “You sure need a manager, </p><p>Magpie, for The Piperock Pilot, Limited— </p><p>to thirteen sheets and a death notice.” </p><p>“Howdy, gents,” states a voice at the </p><p>door. “Is this the only newspaper in </p><p>town?” </p><p> That person is a novelty in cowland.</p><p>He stands there, exuding perfume and </p><p>prosperity from his Sunday clothes. We </p><p>looks him over, from his shiny shoes to his </p><p>hard hat, wonders at his pink cheeks, which </p><p>match his necktie, and both nods. </p><p> “You answers your own question,</p><p>stranger,” states Magpie. “We sure got </p><p>a monopoly on all news hereabouts. Want </p><p>to subscribe?” </p><p> He ambles over and sets down on a stool</p><p>and looks the place over. He takes off his </p><p>hat, balances it on his knee, and produces </p><p>some sheets of paper. </p><p> “What’s your amusement rates?” he</p><p>asks. “Half-page—maybe full.” </p><p> Magpie rolls a fresh smoke and studies</p><p>the feller. </p><p> “Well,” he drawls, “the person who</p><p>operates here ahead of me makes a fixed </p><p>price of three dollars for six months, but </p><p>I don’t sabe no case in which he split the </p><p>size. I don’t guarantee to amuse nobody. </p><p>I’ll be honest with yuh, though. This here </p><p>paper is on its last legs, but I’ll danged near </p><p>guarantee one more issue, and if yuh </p><p>hankers for it I’ll put yuh down for one </p><p>copy at four-bits.” </p><p> “You misunderstood me,” he grins, “I</p><p>mean advertising rates. I’m ahead of </p><p>‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin.’ ” </p><p>Tied Up for Tombstone </p><p>75 </p><p> He puts his hat back on his head, and</p><p>shuffles them sheets of paper: </p><p> “We are bringing to your town the great-</p><p>est aggregation of stars that ever glowed </p><p>over one set of footlights. Two Evas, </p><p>two Topsies, three fee-rocious bloodhounds </p><p>and eight-” </p><p> Splangt</p><p> The side window spills its panes over the</p><p>place, and this person’s hat flips off his head, </p><p>and lands in my lap, while a chunk of lead </p><p>bores a neat hole in the wall behind the </p><p>stranger. He freezes right there. </p><p> Magpie slips his gun across his lap,</p><p>settles down a little lower in his chair, </p><p>and lights his cigaret. I hands the hat </p><p>back to its owner, and slides my chair a few </p><p>inches further back. </p><p> “Eight what?” asks Magpie.</p><p>“Ca-ca-cakes of ice,” he quavers, exam- </p><p>ining his hat. “My-1 Was that a—a— </p><p>bullet?” </p><p> Magpie nods and scratches his chin.</p><p>“Bullet?” he wonders again. “Did— </p><p>did somebody shoot at me?” </p><p> “Nope,” says Magpie. “At me. What</p><p>yuh going to do with the ice?” </p><p> He looks at Magpie for a minute, and</p><p>then gasps— </p><p> “At a—a time like this?”</p><p> He tucks his hat under his arm, sneaks</p><p>to the door, and goes around the corner so </p><p>fast his coat simply cracks. </p><p> Magpie slips his gun loose and spins the</p><p>cylinder, hitches up his belt and yawns: </p><p>“Ike, I ain’t got nothing to prove who it </p><p>was but I has the feeling that Tombstone </p><p>is going too danged far. There’s such a </p><p>thing as personal animosity, but when yuh </p><p>bust into a man’s business and cause him </p><p>financial loss it’s time to start a probe. </p><p>That show person was about to help us</p><p>pay our overhead expenses, but now he’s </p><p>gone gun-shy. </p><p> “I hereby deputizes you to operate this</p><p>here plant, while I fulfils the obligations </p><p>of my oath concerning public nuisances. </p><p>You got plenty of ammunition, Ike?” </p><p> “I ain’t no editor, Magpie,” I objects.</p><p>“I can’t even sign my own name so folks </p><p>can read it.” </p><p> “Sign mine,” says he. “You’re editor</p><p>pro tempore. Sabe?” And then he slips </p><p>out of the door. </p><p> I looks around, casual-like, places my</p><p>.41 beside me on a chair, and sets down out </p><p>of line with any window or door. It’s </p><p>warm in there, and there’s a funny smell </p><p>about the place. I had several scoops of </p><p>gall and wormwood in Buck’s place, and </p><p>the combination woos sleep in copious gobs. </p><p>My sombrero slips over my face, and I sleep. </p><p> Sudden-like I wakes, and believe me she’s</p><p>a rude awakening. Somebody kicks the </p><p>chair out from under me, and proceeds to </p><p>knead my abdomen with their knees, toes, </p><p>fingers, thumbs and head. When that </p><p>part is over they turns me on my face and </p><p>rakes me fore and aft with a pair of long- </p><p>roweled spurs, while they links their hands </p><p>in my hair and hammers my forehead 011 </p><p>the floor. When I ain’t got more than a </p><p>glimmer of light left in my system they </p><p>seems to draw aside and rest. </p><p> “There!” I hears a voice state. “Next</p><p>time yuh prints your danged newspaper </p><p>you’ll please leave my name out. Sabe? </p><p>I ain’t no shepherd, and my shirt is as clean </p><p>as yours!” </p><p> “ ‘Dirty Shirt’ Jones, you’re an assassin,”</p><p>says I, weak-like. </p><p> He pulls my hat off the bridge of my nose</p><p>and takes a look at me. </p><p> “Ike, I’m glad to see yuh back,” says he.</p><p>“When did yuh get back?” </p><p> “Today. Are you the reception com-</p><p>mittee?” </p><p> “Me? Nope. I’m an enraged citizen,</p><p>Ike. 1 mistook yuh for the editor.” </p><p> “No mistake, Dirty, I’m him.”</p><p> Of course I got that . 41 in my hands when</p><p>I makes that statement, and Dirty don’t </p><p>make no demonstration. </p><p> “Take it easy,” I advises. “I ain’t the</p><p>one you’re sore at. Magpie is the regular </p><p>editor but he’s down at the jail.” </p><p> Dirty chaws for a few seconds, and</p><p>hitches up his pants: </p><p> “Much obliged, Ike. Sorry I licked yuh</p><p>thataway. Yuh sec that paper orates that </p><p>the population ought to get sanitary— </p><p>whatever that is. He states that a dirty </p><p>shirt designates a shepherd—dang his hide! </p><p>Well, Ike, I gives yuh good afternoon.” </p><p>“Good afternoon ain’t much to give a </p><p>man after you’ve give him-,” I opines. </p><p>“But I’ll take it, Dirty, old-timer. I </p><p>reckon I’ll need everything I can get before </p><p>I goes to press.” </p><p>I sets there and complains bitterly to </p><p>myself about folks who don’t keep up to </p><p>date on news, wipes the worst of the ink </p><p>off my face, and goes back to sleep. </p><p>“Slim” Hawkins woke me up. Slim would </p><p>76 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>make a good running-mate for Magpie. </p><p>He’s built in the same proportions. He’s </p><p>had a few drinks, and is as serious as a owl. </p><p> “Ike,” says he, “take a look at my eyes</p><p>and see if they’re all right.” </p><p> “Little off color but pointing straight,</p><p>Slim. What’s wrong?” </p><p> “Somebody drops a paper at the ranch</p><p>today, and when I tries to peruse same I </p><p>finds that I’m left-handed and cross-eyed. </p><p>I’ve suffered a heap, Ike, and while I hopes </p><p>for the best I fears the worst. I’d hate to </p><p>go around looking at things backwards </p><p>thataway. Might as well learn to read </p><p>Chinese. Where’s the educated party what </p><p>operates this here newspaper?” </p><p> “He’s—” I begins, but an apparition</p><p>which I deciphers to be Dirty Shirt, comes </p><p>in the door. </p><p> He seems to have met disaster. His hair</p><p>has been pawed down over a pair of black </p><p>eyes, and over his head and under one arm </p><p>hangs what is left of a framed map of </p><p>Montana, which adorned Magpie’s office. </p><p>^53 HE FEELS painfully in his pockets, </p><p>^ ^ takes out three silver dollars, and </p><p>lU 2 «l lays ’em on the table. </p><p> “Dirty Shirt Jones—three months,” he</p><p>states, slow and sad-like. </p><p> “Your subscription expired?” I asks, and</p><p>he nods. </p><p> “Uh-huh. I reckon. Everything else has.”</p><p>“Better take back some of it,” I advises. </p><p>“This here paper is about to cease. One </p><p>more effort cleans the rack.” </p><p>“I know,” nods Dirty Shirt. “Keep the </p><p>money and send me a copy. If Magpie can </p><p>edit like he can fight I’ll covet that copy.” </p><p>“Keep that frame to put it in,” says I. </p><p>“You met the editor, did yuh?” </p><p> Dirty squints at me, adjusts that frame</p><p>to a easier position, and rubs his sore eyes. </p><p> “Met him!” he snorts. “Met-! We</p><p>mingled!” </p><p> Dirty weaves out of the door and points</p><p>up the street. Slim looks at them three </p><p>dollars and then lays three more beside ’em. </p><p> “I don’t sabe the game, Ike, but I’m</p><p>matching Dirty’s ante. I don’t know what </p><p>Magpie’s argument is, but anybody what </p><p>can make Dirty Shirt pay three dollars </p><p>for a left-handed newspaper must have </p><p>something besides conversation.” </p><p> “But Dirty Shirt was sore,” says I. “He</p><p>came down to lick the editor.” </p><p> “Me, too, Ike. I came with malice in</p><p>my heart but I goes away plumb meek. </p><p>Dirty Shirt licked thunder out of me once, </p><p>so I’m three dollars thankful that he met </p><p>Magpie first. Have a little drink?” </p><p>“That’s the first United States I’ve heard </p><p>spoken since I got home,” says I. “But </p><p>I can’t leave the office alone. You go up </p><p>and have one, and then play editor while </p><p>I goes up. Sabe?” </p><p> Slim comes back in a few minutes, and</p><p>holds down the place while I pilgrims up </p><p>to Buck’s place. Me and Buck and “Half- </p><p>Mile” Smith leans on the door and discusses </p><p>local conditions. </p><p> “Show troupe in town,” states Half-Mile.</p><p>“Came in on the stage. Seven or eight </p><p>people, two colored persons and some dogs. </p><p>They got a drum and a lot of horns, etcet- </p><p>tery. I’d opine we’ll have some music.” </p><p> “I love a good show,” says Buck. “The</p><p>last good one I seen was at Silver Bend. </p><p>They played Shakespeare. Had a ghost </p><p>and I was just drunk enough to enjoy it.” </p><p>“Give me a drink, quick!” pants a voice </p><p>at the door, and into the place comes </p><p>“Ricky” Henderson. He takes a long drink </p><p>out of the bottle, and leans against tlie bar. </p><p> “Suffering surcingles!” he pants. “I’ve</p><p>sure had one job! That or’nary hombre, </p><p>Tombstone Todd, comes into my place a </p><p>while ago, and climbs into a chair. </p><p> “ ‘Young feller,’ says he, ‘my hair and</p><p>whiskers are too noticeable, so I admires </p><p>to see ’em on the floor.’ He hauls out a</p><p>six-gun, lays it across his lap, and leans </p><p>back in the chair. ‘Young feller,’ says he </p><p>again, ‘a razor what pulls is an abomination </p><p>and a barber what uses one is flirting with </p><p>the undertaker. Let your judgment be </p><p>your guide.’ ” </p><p> “Was he satisfied?” asks Buck.</p><p>“I’m here, ain’t I?” grins Ricky. “But </p><p>I wouldn’t do it again for a million dollars.” </p><p>“And you with a razor in your hand all </p><p>this time, and his head tilted back?” </p><p>wonders Half-Mile, aloud. </p><p> Ricky stares at Half-Mile and considers</p><p>the remark. </p><p> “I seen a colored brother with a razor</p><p>once—” began Half-Mile, but he happens </p><p>to glance towards the door. </p><p> We all takes a look.</p><p> “Speak of the devil and—” murmurs</p><p>Buck, but the colored person at the door </p><p>bursts into profanity that would shame a </p><p>professor from a mule college. </p><p> “Why didn’t yuh come back, Ike?” he</p><p>Tied Up for Tombstone </p><p>77 </p><p>wails. “Sus-somebodv sneaked in, hit me </p><p>over the head, dud-dragged me into the </p><p>back room and poured a can of ink all over </p><p>me! My-! It won’t never come off! </p><p>He said he wanted to make me eat some </p><p>paste, but he couldn’t find it. Look at me! </p><p>All inked to-!” </p><p> “Gosh!” exclaims Magpie from the door-</p><p>way. “Ain’t that too danged bad! That’s </p><p>the only can of ink there was left.” </p><p> “Too bad, eh?” howls Slim. “I wish</p><p>I knowed the name of that hombre.” </p><p> “Did he speak feelingly of paste?” asks</p><p>Magpie. </p><p> “Uh-huh,” agrees Slim, drawing figures</p><p>on the bar with his inky finger. “He sort </p><p>of choked over the word. He-” </p><p> “Hey! Sam!” yells a voice at the door,</p><p>and we observes a stranger in our midst. </p><p> It’s sort of dark inside, but he seems to</p><p>know what he wants. He ambles straight </p><p>up to Slim, and grabs him by the arm. </p><p> “You slew-footed, wobble-jointed son of</p><p>a cannibal!” he yelps. “Where’s them pink </p><p>silk underclothes of mine, eh?” </p><p> Slim Hawkins is slow to anger, but when</p><p>he does get to going he’s hard to stop. He </p><p>climbs under and over and through this </p><p>stranger like he was searching for some- </p><p>thing, and when he gets through this feller </p><p>ain’t got nothing on but a look of wonder- </p><p>ment and one sleeve of his undershirt. </p><p>Slim looks over the pile of clothes on the </p><p>floor, and shakes his head: </p><p> “I can’t find ’em,” he states, serious-like.</p><p>“Furthermore I don’t admire to be called </p><p>a son of a cannibal, Mister Man!” </p><p> The feller braces his hands behind him</p><p>on the floor, and shakes his head like he was </p><p>trying to collect his thoughts. He squints </p><p>at Slim, and then explodes:</p><p> “My-! You ain’t Sam!”</p><p>“A slight inquiry would have saved us all </p><p>this search,” says Slim. “Who is Sam?” </p><p>“One of my company—my Uncle Tom.” </p><p>“So?” drawled Slim. “You with this </p><p>here ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ outfit?” </p><p> “Yes,” says he. “I’m Simon Legree."</p><p> “So?”</p><p>Slim picks the gent up by one leg and </p><p>an arm, carries him out and dumps him </p><p>right into the street without no clothes on. </p><p> “There!” yells Slim, as the stranger hits</p><p>the dirt. “I’ve read all about yuh, Mister </p><p>Legree, and this is one colored person yuh </p><p>can’t run no sandy on. Sabe?” </p><p> This Legree person don’t linger. It’s</p><p>about two hundred yards to Holt’s hotel </p><p>door, and he negotiates the distance in the </p><p>time it takes Slim to shoot six shots into </p><p>the dirt behind him. On his way he meets </p><p>“Cobalt” Williams. Cobalt steps to one </p><p>side to let him past, catches his spur in the </p><p>dirt, and sets down. It spoils his aim, he </p><p>tears the knob off the door after it shuts be- </p><p>hind Legree. Cobalt gets up and comes on </p><p>down to the saloon, shaking his head. </p><p> “What yuh trying to do—kill him? Yuh</p><p>danged fool!” snorts Slim. </p><p> Cobalt had reached for the bottle, but</p><p>he turns to look at Slim and his hand drops. </p><p>He pushes his hat back and stares at Slim </p><p>and seems to swaller with difficulty. </p><p> “Ex-cuse me,” he says, sort of to himself.</p><p>“No more Paradise hooch for mine! Mike </p><p>Pelly said it was a hundred and twenty </p><p>proof, and this proves it. First I see a </p><p>naked man running around the main street, </p><p>and then I meets a colored brother what </p><p>looks like Slim Hawkins. I’m through! </p><p>Sabe? I’m going home—me!” </p><p> He ducks out, gets his bronc at the rack</p><p>and points out of town. </p><p> “That’s what I’d call a temperance</p><p>lecture in ink,” opines Magpie. “As editor </p><p>and a man of letters I congratulates yuh. </p><p>We can hereby reverse that old saying,</p><p>‘He who runs may read’ and make it, ‘He </p><p>who reads may run.’ ” </p><p>IffSI WE INAUGURATES a poker game </p><p>wL'j an(l plays until almost dark, when </p><p>■ sudden-like we hears the sound of </p><p>music, and stampedes to the door. Here </p><p>comes that show bunch down the street, </p><p>and stops in front of the old Mint Hall. </p><p>They got a banner what proclaims there </p><p>will be a show tonight, and “Mighty” </p><p>Jones is packing the banner, with his chest </p><p>stuck out like a fool-hen after a feed. </p><p> We cashes in and goes over to the band.</p><p> “When did you start to be a actor,</p><p>Mighty?” asks Magpie, but the feller what </p><p>Slim took apart steps between Magpie and </p><p>Mighty and peers at Magpie’s star. </p><p> “Pardon me,” says he, “I see you’re the</p><p>sheriff.” </p><p> “You’re pardoned, and I congratulates</p><p>yuh on your eyesight,” replies Magpie. </p><p> “I’ve lost my dogs,” says he. “Some-</p><p>body must ’a’ stole ’em.” </p><p> By this time most everybody in Piperock</p><p>has congregated around. Music sure is a </p><p>magnet for folks and dogs. </p><p>73 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Pick out what yuh want,” says Magpie,</p><p>indicating any amount of canines, circling </p><p>around through people’s legs. “Losing a </p><p>few dogs ain’t no disaster around here.” </p><p>“Mine are valuable dogs,” states Legree, </p><p>in a loud tone. “Trained dogs. Our show </p><p>can’t proceed without them dogs.” </p><p> “Name, age and description,” says Mag-</p><p>pie, hauling out a little note-book. “Also </p><p>any distinguishing marks and brands.” </p><p>“One bloodhound, crossed with St. Ber- </p><p>nard and collie; color, yaller; named Violet.” </p><p>“War-hoo-o-o-o!” howls a dog up the </p><p>street. t </p><p> “Yeo-o-o-o-oivI” yells somebody. “Look</p><p>out!” </p><p> There’s a sudden movement at the far</p><p>end of the congregation. I sees a bronc </p><p>turn a handspring, a pair of cream-colored </p><p>broncs leaves their halters at the hitch- </p><p>rack, while they comes over to visit us, </p><p>and Violet is no longer a lost dog. </p><p> Violet is about the size of a he-wolf, and</p><p>she seems to think she can outrun the string </p><p>of tomato cans which are tied to her tail. </p><p>She goes through, under and over that </p><p>crowd, and what she don’t do to us is left </p><p>for that pair of broncs and the buckboard. </p><p>A million dog-fights start right there. </p><p> Me and Legree are close together and</p><p>the confusion seems to bring us close to </p><p>each other. We hits the sidewalk together </p><p>and I’m underneath. A couple of rotten </p><p>boards break, and yours truly disappears. </p><p> When I recovers sufficient-like to peek</p><p>out it’s about all over. Every bronc that </p><p>was tied to the rack is gone, and part of one </p><p>rack is missing. Most of the crowd is on </p><p>the far side of the street, but our side is still </p><p>well represented. Two local dogs are still </p><p>hauling at each other. </p><p> Dirty Shirt Jones’ head protrudes from</p><p>the side of that big drum, and his right arm </p><p>is wedged straight up, making him look </p><p>like a drownding man what is going down </p><p>for the last time. </p><p> Mighty Jones has got one boot through</p><p>the mechanical end of a big brass horn, </p><p>while from inside the other boot protrudes </p><p>that banner, with the proclamation missing. </p><p> Magpie is lying near me, with both feet</p><p>through Wick Smith’s picket fence, and he’s </p><p>still studying that little note-book. </p><p> “Was that last one Lucy or Hannibal?”</p><p>he asks, slow and deliberate. </p><p> “It—it don’t make no matter,” says a</p><p>weak voice, “they’re all gone past anyway,” </p><p>and the man who got his hat punctured in </p><p>the newspaper office rises up from behind </p><p>the fence, and tugs at the brim of his hat, </p><p>which is hanging around his neck. </p><p> I goes out and helps to cut Dirty Shirt</p><p>loose from the drum, when up comes one of </p><p>Holt’s kids. </p><p>“Mister,” says he to the show feller, </p><p>“I seen a man tie them cans on your dogs.” </p><p>“Give the sheriff a description of him,” </p><p>says he, excited-like. “I offers ten dollars </p><p>reward for the conviction of the persons </p><p>connected with the dastardly outrage.” </p><p>“Cheap enough,” agrees Magpie. “Did </p><p>he have a long mustache and long hair?” </p><p>“Naw. He didn’t have no hair on his </p><p>face a-tall,” replies the kid. </p><p> “Must a been an outside job,” proclaims</p><p>Magpie. “All the men in Piperock wear </p><p>hair on their faces, except Slim Hawkins, </p><p>and he wears ink.” </p><p> Me and Magpie pilgrims home and uses</p><p>up a bottle of hoss liniment. </p><p> “When yuh going to get that Tombstone</p><p>person?” I asks, after we finishes our </p><p>supper. “There ain’t no sense in leaving a </p><p>critter like him loose, Magpie.” </p><p> “He’s a ornery hombre all right, all</p><p>right,” agrees Magpie. “He ain’t so dan- </p><p>gerous as he is plumb mean, Ike. He’s shot </p><p>at me several times, but as he ain’t hit me </p><p>yet I reckon he’s trying to scare me. Must </p><p>’a’ been Cactus what painted Slim with the </p><p>ink. Me and Slim are the same build. </p><p> “I sure wish that Tombstone could live</p><p>long enough to read his obituary, Ike. </p><p>She’s a bird. I sure dug deep into my soul</p><p>for that stuff, and I surprises myself with </p><p>what I writes. Them two is sore over the </p><p>election. They opined to be deputies </p><p>under Anderson.” </p><p> “That paper must ’a’ printed some truths</p><p>about folks,” I opines, and Magpie grins: </p><p>“You said something, Ike. He sure did </p><p>ride folks. Yuh ought to see what he said </p><p>about Paradise folks. I reckon they’re </p><p>just about starting to boil over down there.” </p><p>“Didn’t you print yours right soon, </p><p>Magpie?” I asks. “Seems to me that it’s a </p><p>weekly.” </p><p> “Uh-huh—comes out on Friday. Yuh</p><p>see I had to change that day right off the </p><p>reel, ’cause if I had any hangings to attend </p><p>to it would interfere with the paper. I </p><p>looks into the future, Ike.” </p><p> “Well,” says I, “it don’t make much</p><p>difference now, being as the ink is all gone.” </p><p>Tied Up for Tombstone </p><p>79 </p><p> “That’s so. I wish you’d ’a’ stayed there</p><p> and ’tended to business, Ike.”</p><p> “And got all hiked up, eh? I never did</p><p> have any luck, and if it had ’a’ been me</p><p> somebody would ’a’ come in and helped</p><p> Cactus find that paste jar. Too bad the</p><p> show got busted up thataway.”</p><p> “Uh-huh,” yawns Magpie. “We ain’t</p><p> had a good show for a long time, but I don’t</p><p> admire a show what depends on three dogs</p><p> and eight cakes of ice. Let’s hit the hay.”</p><p> That night somebody comes down and</p><p> paints a skull and cross bones on our door,</p><p> and it makes Magpie sore.</p><p> “I’m commencing to get riled internally,</p><p> Ike,” he states, when he views said works</p><p> of art. “You go back and hold down the</p><p> newspaper, and in a little while I’ll show</p><p> yuh the scalp of this artist. Rustle around</p><p> and see if there’s any ink left.</p><p> “I got that obituary all fixed up left-</p><p> handed, and she’s cached under a soap-box</p><p> behind the printing machine. Don’t jiggle</p><p>' it ’cause she’s fragile as-! I left that </p><p> page just like she was for the other paper,</p><p> but I got a place in it what fits this here</p><p> masterpiece of mine. If Tombstone should</p><p> make a mistake and hit me yuh won’t need</p><p> the obituary. Sabe?”</p><p> “Uh-huh, I’ll just run the rest, Magpie.</p><p> It looks like a bundle o’ crape anyway.”</p><p> “And Ike,” he reminds me, as I buckles</p><p> on my gun, “yuh take that type stuff and</p><p> put it inside the press. Sabe? Then yuh</p><p> take that roller thing and pour on some ink,</p><p> roll her over the letters, slap on a sheet of</p><p> paper and twist that handle down hard.”</p><p> “You furnish the news, Magpie,” says I.</p><p> “I’ll hold the wheels of progress for Tomb-</p><p> stone Todd.”</p><p> I GOES up to Buck’s place, and</p><p> settles some elixir under my belt,</p><p> while me and Buck talks over the</p><p> humdrum existence we’re leading.</p><p> “Dirty Shirt is still going around with</p><p> his right hand up in the air,” laughs Buck.</p><p> “Reckon he’s flagged every one in sight.”</p><p> “How’s the show outfit?” I asks.</p><p> “Right miserable, I reckon. All of ’em</p><p> except one left on the stage this morning.</p><p> That exception—a colored person—mis-</p><p> takes Slim for a blood-brother, and being</p><p> as Slim ain’t back yet, I’d say they went</p><p> quite a ways. I never seen fast black fade</p><p> the way that person did.</p><p> “That other colored member didn’t have</p><p>much to say this morning. He was packing </p><p>one of them slide horns in the band last </p><p>night, and when the buckboard hit him </p><p>he sails right into Pete Gonyer. Him and </p><p>Pete holds about even until Pete gets his </p><p>hands loose, and then he winds that horn </p><p>around the feller’s neck so many times </p><p>that we has to lay that colored gent across </p><p>an anvil and cut it loose with a cold-chisel.” </p><p>“Seen anything of Tombstone Todd or </p><p>Cactus Collins?” I asks, but Buck says: </p><p>“Nope. Somebody ought to puncture </p><p>that pair of Jaspers, Ike. I figure there’s </p><p>only one critter what is meaner than Tomb- </p><p>stone Todd, and there’s a bounty on his </p><p>hide. I ain’t been drunk for six years, Ike, </p><p>but when Tombstone Todd stops enough </p><p>lead to make him a spirit I’m going to </p><p>celebrate. When does Magpie aim to </p><p>exterminate said human coyote?” </p><p> “Magpie suffers from softening of the</p><p>heart,” says I “but him or Tombstone is </p><p>due to hunt the hereafter right soon.” </p><p> I leaves there, and pilgrims down to the</p><p>newspaper office, but I don’t walk right </p><p>inside. Not me. The Harper tribe ain’t </p><p>skittish of trouble, and my nose ain’t a </p><p>stranger to powder smoke, but I’m cautious. </p><p> I Injuns up to the back window, flattens</p><p>my carcass against the wall and peers </p><p>inside. I ain’t taking no chances. Sabe? </p><p>It’s a little too early to open up, and the </p><p>sunshine is nice and warm. Everything is </p><p>peaceful-looking around Piperock, so I sets </p><p>down there on a box against the wall, and </p><p>communes thusly: </p><p> “Ike Harper, you sure do live in the best</p><p>little town on earth. Peaceful and quiet— </p><p>no hurry or worry. Plenty of time to live </p><p>and no questions asked. What if I am a </p><p>editor? It sure is worth while to live</p><p>simply and quietly in a community where </p><p>brotherly love is the motto and where </p><p>peace doves nest and suckle their young.” </p><p>Sudden-like I hears the dull rattle of </p><p>many hoofs, and down the street comes a </p><p>lot of men on hosses. They completes a </p><p>picture of a peaceful Western village. </p><p>There ain’t no boisterous or unseemly </p><p>language as they ambles along through the </p><p>dust—just the jingle of bit-chains and the </p><p>squeak of saddles. </p><p>They don’t look like they was going far, </p><p>’cause they don’t seem to have no baggage. </p><p>One of ’em is carrying a big bucket, and </p><p>another seems to have a bundle hi his arms. </p><p>They swings down towards me, but I </p><p>8o </p><p>Adventure </p><p>merely yawns. They stops in front of my </p><p>office, and dismounts. I reckon it’s my </p><p>chore to go out and get ’em to subscribe, </p><p>but I don’t do it. I got enough subscrip- </p><p>tions. They must ’a’ thought the only </p><p>way to get into a newspaper office was by </p><p>main force, so they picks up a piece of </p><p>lodge-pole, and knocks the door down. </p><p> Comes one shot—no more. Out of</p><p>curiosity, more than anything else, I sort </p><p>of leans forward on my box and takes note </p><p>of what I can see. Out in front the crowd </p><p>sort of surrounds somebody, what ain’t got </p><p>no clothes on. I don’t hear much con- </p><p>versation what ain’t profane, and pretty </p><p>soon I sees some feathers drift away on the </p><p>breeze. Two broncs are linked together </p><p>with that pole, a bundle what looks like a </p><p>mighty buzzard is straddled the pole, and </p><p>they all moves away as quietly as they came. </p><p> I watches ’em go away, and then I yawns</p><p>some more and enters the sacred precincts </p><p>of The Piperock Pilot. I hunts all over the </p><p>place until I finds a can with a little ink </p><p>left in it. I looks under the soap-box and </p><p>finds that obituary. After considerable </p><p>trouble I deciphers same, and this is it: </p><p>EPITAPH ON TOMBSTONE </p><p> He was a bad man from Wilier Crick.</p><p> His bluff was good bul it didn’t slick.</p><p>He shot at the sheriff till the sheriff got sore. </p><p>Now his bools leave tracks on that beautiful shore. </p><p> I wipes the tears off my cheeks when I</p><p>reads it. Magpie said he had put his soul </p><p>into it, but I never knowed before how deep </p><p>Magpie’s soul really was. It’s a hy-iu </p><p>composition, but I got a better idea. I </p><p>takes it over to where them lead letters </p><p>repose, and reconstructs the thing a bit. </p><p> I ain’t no poet, but in a time like this a</p><p>man’s spirit guides his fingers. I works </p><p>for an hour, trying to make the blamed </p><p>things stand up long enough to be read </p><p>backwards, and I’m sore enough to kick </p><p>a baby when Magpie shows up. He looks </p><p>at me and grins, when he sees what I’m</p><p>doing, and rolls a smoke. </p><p> “One of ’em has left, Ike,” he states.</p><p>“Hank Padden rode in a while ago, and </p><p>said he met Cactus Collins on his way to </p><p>Wilier Crick. I’ll get Tombstone before </p><p>night. Sabe?” </p><p> “Them is noble resolutions, Magpie.</p><p>You know how to make this stuff stand up </p><p>while she leaves her message on paper?” </p><p>“Sure. What yuh want to print it for, </p><p> Ike? We ain’t got no paper to waste.”</p><p> “Magpie,” says I, “a editor likes to see</p><p> his stuff printed. I got a old piece of paper</p><p> what will do for this.”</p><p> Magpie sets the stuff in a little oblong</p><p> affair, rolls on some ink, lays on the piece</p><p> of paper, and twists down the handle. This</p><p> is how she looks:</p><p>TAR-ON TOMBSTONE </p><p>He was a bad man from Wilier Crick, </p><p> On his birthday suit grows feathers thick.</p><p> Feathers and tar instead of a grave,</p><p> Mistook for an editor ’cause of a shave.</p><p> Magpie reads it all through. He sets</p><p> down on a box, rolls a smoke, and reads it</p><p> some more. He walks out to the door,</p><p> looks around, and comes back.</p><p> “Who?” he asks.</p><p> “Paradise folks, Magpie.”</p><p> “Did you see him in here?”</p><p> “Uh-huh. He was laying for us.”</p><p> “Pshaw!”</p><p> Magpie takes his gun out and looks it</p><p> over, sad-like. He stares at the door for a</p><p> minute, and then—</p><p> “What’s the notice on the door?”</p><p> He walks over and looks. Somebody has</p><p> printed a notice and pinned it on that</p><p> busted door, and she reads like this—</p><p> THIS PAPER HAS QUIT FOR KEEPS</p><p> I went back and got that can of ink, and</p><p> a stick, and I signs it—</p><p>TOMBSTONE TODD </p><p> “What for, Ike?” asks Magpie. “What</p><p> did he have to do with it?”</p><p>“Come back here, and I’ll show yuh.” </p><p> I takes him back to the table, and shows</p><p> him a line of lead letters setting there on</p><p> the table. It’s the biggest in sight, and</p><p> they reads:</p><p>EPITAF FOR MAGPY SIMPKIN. BRAVE </p><p>MEN AND DARN FULES DON’T SKARE. </p><p>HE WAS A DARN FULE MAY IIE </p><p>REST IN PIECE </p><p> We walks almost to the door, when</p><p> Magpie goes back and gets that stick and</p><p> the can of ink.</p><p> “I’ll give him all the credit coming to</p><p> him, Ike,” says he, and underneath Tomb-</p><p> stone’s name he prints—</p><p>EDITOR PRO TEMPORE </p><p>A THPEX-PART /TORY </p><p>-concLUJion- </p><p>o^Kathrene </p><p>and Robert" </p><p>Pinkerfon — </p><p>Authors of “On Guard," ! </p><p>CHAPTER XII </p><p>THE ISLINOIS COLLECT </p><p>*te^^jINCE his arrival at the Misisepe </p><p>®-'ver had seen no indica- </p><p>tions of the presence of savages. </p><p>The Ouisconsin apparently flowed </p><p>through an unpeopled wilderness. So far </p><p>as he had been able to discover the land </p><p>lay empty. </p><p> His sudden resolution, his new deter-</p><p>mination to return to Virginia and make </p><p>good his claim to this beautiful country </p><p>for his own people, had completely oc- </p><p>cupied his mind for the moment. The new </p><p>zeal burned fiercely and he had-no thought </p><p>except the hundreds of leagues he must put </p><p>behind him in his new mission. </p><p> He half-fell down the very side of the</p><p>great bluff, catching trees and saplings to </p><p>steady himself, leaping over boulders, </p><p>crashing through brush. When almost </p><p>down he remembered what the three cou- </p><p>reurs de bois had told him of a Jesuit priest </p><p>named Jacques Marquette who was plan- </p><p>ning a journey to the mysterious Misisepe as </p><p>soon as a representative of the French king </p><p>The White Indiansetc. </p><p>should join him at Michilimakinac. The </p><p>thought that they might arrive any day, </p><p>might return first with news of their dis- </p><p>covery, spurred him to fresh recklessness, </p><p>and he dashed out into the open space at the </p><p>foot of the bluff so swiftly he was carried to </p><p>the water’s edge by the impetus of his </p><p>descent. </p><p> Intent only upon the need of speed if he</p><p>were to make his return trip to Virginia </p><p>before Fall, he wheeled at once toward the </p><p>place where he had left his canoe. </p><p> Then for the first time he became aware</p><p>that he was not alone. Between him and </p><p>his craft stood forty or fifty savages, all of</p><p>whom were regarding him with undisguised </p><p>astonishment. Instantly he recognized </p><p>them by their moccasins and weapons to be </p><p>Islinois. And in the same instant he real- </p><p>ized that he faced a danger to himself and </p><p>its consequent defeat of his new purpose. </p><p> Quickly he searched the faces of the</p><p>Indians, seeking one which might even re- </p><p>semble a victim of Pombert’s treachery on </p><p>the Islinois River. If he were known or </p><p>suspected he knew that there was no hope, </p><p>that his journey would end even before it </p><p>82 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>began and his discovery of the “great </p><p>water” would be valueless. </p><p> As Dick stood before the group of sav-</p><p>ages, studying each expressionless face for </p><p>some sign of recognition or of hostility, his </p><p>heart leaped at the thought that the Islinois </p><p>were a people of scores of villages, that, men, </p><p>women and children, they numbered more </p><p>than a hundred thousand. The chances of </p><p>these men coming from the distant village </p><p>from which he and the three Frenchmen had </p><p>escaped was slight. He was about to walk </p><p>forward with his hands stretched out in a </p><p>sign of friendliness when the group parted </p><p>and a warrior stepped forth and faced his </p><p>companions. </p><p> Immediately he began to speak, and so</p><p>slowly that Dick had no difficulty in under- </p><p>standing him. </p><p> “This is one of the white men of whom we</p><p>have heard,” the savage began. “For </p><p>many years there have come to us stories of </p><p>these people with hairy faces who kill </p><p>without arrows or clubs, who make many </p><p>things of iron. The Outaouas and Hurons </p><p>have traded with them since I was a child, </p><p>but only the few of us who have gone north </p><p>to the great lake at Chequamoigan have </p><p>ever seen them. </p><p> “Last Summer, as you all know, four of</p><p>these white men came to our country. </p><p>They had canoes laden with things to trade, </p><p>and they had much of the strong water that </p><p>robs us of our senses. They met some of </p><p>our people, far up our river, and after ma- </p><p>king them mad with the strong water they </p><p>stole all they had. Some of our people in </p><p>the next village were warned and the white </p><p>men fled, leaving everything behind them. </p><p> “Because of the strong water our people</p><p>fought and killed each other. They be- </p><p>came mad, threw each other into the fire, </p><p>set their homes ablaze, were worse than the </p><p>beasts. None of us here was in that village </p><p>but all of us have heard of what happened </p><p>there. We have all sworn to have revenge, </p><p>for even the goods that they left in their </p><p>flight could not pay for the lives that were </p><p>taken from us. </p><p> “This,” and he pointed to Dick, “is one</p><p>of their race. Few of them have dared ven- </p><p>ture so far from the great water to the east. </p><p>This man might even be one of them. If he </p><p>is, it is our duty to the Islinois to take him </p><p>with us, to show him to the people of that </p><p>village. Then we can have vengeance. If </p><p>he is not we will not harm him, and we will </p><p>give him presents and send him back to his </p><p>own people with a warning of the wrath of </p><p>the Islinois against all those who plunder </p><p>and slay as did those four white men on the </p><p>big river in our own country. </p><p> “We have heard that the white men are</p><p>fair and generous, that they give fine pres- </p><p>ents and that their goods are such as we </p><p>would like to have. We want to be friendly </p><p>with the white people, but the honor of our </p><p>nation will not permit us to submit to rob- </p><p>bery and death. If good white men come </p><p>we will welcome them, but we must make </p><p>the white men understand now that we are </p><p>not to be plundered.” </p><p> Dick saw many nods of approval as the</p><p>man, evidently a chief, finished speaking, </p><p>and he knew that quick action was neces- </p><p>sary if he were to thwart a procedure that </p><p>meant certain death for him. </p><p> “I am pleased to hear so fair a speech</p><p>from the men of the Islinois,” he said as he </p><p>stepped closer. “I am glad, too, that you </p><p>have spoken so plainly about the four white </p><p>men who plundered a village of your people. </p><p>It is only just that such men should pay </p><p>the penalty. </p><p> “White men are not all such as those who</p><p>have visited you. There are people of your </p><p>own race who do not always do right and </p><p>the same is true of white men, for they are </p><p>all children of the one Father. White men </p><p>have a justice of their own that is bigger </p><p>than the justice of your people. If a man </p><p>does wrong we do not wait for the people of </p><p>his victims to take revenge. He is punished </p><p>if his crime is known. </p><p> “I know the four white men who violated</p><p>your people last Summer.” </p><p> There was an unconscious forward move-</p><p>ment on the part of the savages at this an- </p><p>nouncement and their attention was com- </p><p>plete.</p><p> “One of them himself drank of the strong</p><p>water enough to loosen his tongue,” Dick </p><p>continued, “and he told of what they had </p><p>done. Did the white men who heard him </p><p>tell him he was brave? Did they give him </p><p>presents because of his deed? I will tell you </p><p>how they answered him.” </p><p> Dick drew his hatchet from his belt and</p><p>held it aloft dramatically. </p><p> “That hand, that arm, that hatchet,” he</p><p>exclaimed, “broke the head of the white </p><p>man who plundered your people! He was </p><p>the leader. The others were only his tools, </p><p>as arrows in his hands. They ran into the </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>83 </p><p>forest and escaped. But he who led them </p><p>against your people, who alone was re- </p><p>sponsible for their crime, was dead within </p><p>seven days after he fled from your coun- </p><p>try.” </p><p> The savages, easily swayed by eloquence,</p><p>lovers of the dramatic, were profoundly im- </p><p>pressed. They began to talk excitedly, and </p><p>several made friendly advances. Only the </p><p>man who had first spoken remained silent. </p><p>He stood in front of Dick looking steadily </p><p>and searchingly into the white man’s eyes. </p><p>His arms were folded across his bare chest </p><p>and as the chatter behind him increased his </p><p>brows contracted in a frown. </p><p> “I am glad to hear the words of the white</p><p>man,” he said as he waved his hand for </p><p>silence. “If they are true words none </p><p>could sound better. If they are not true </p><p>our people are unavenged. I feel that they </p><p>are true but I can not go back to my people </p><p>and make them believe what I believe. </p><p>They must hear the white man themselves </p><p>or they will never know. If the white </p><p>man’s words are true he will receive many </p><p>presents from my people. We will show </p><p>him how many and how great we are and he </p><p>will come to trade with us and get furs. We </p><p>will take him with us to our country and </p><p>give him presents and let him tell the people </p><p>of the plundered village how he has avenged </p><p>their wrongs.” </p><p> An exclamation of approval broke from</p><p>the savages and they began to press forward </p><p>eagerly. </p><p> “But,” protested Dick, “I must hurry</p><p>back to my own country if I am to return </p><p>before the snow comes with more goods. It </p><p>is a journey of many moons.” </p><p> “If the white man has spoken the truth</p><p>he will have no fear to come among us, and </p><p>we will pay him richly for his goods,” said </p><p>‘ the chief with a gesture of finality. </p><p>DICK argued, protested, but the </p><p>more he talked the deeper became </p><p>the frown on the chief’s face, the </p><p>more open his suspicion. The Virginian </p><p>saw his mistake. Then, too, he realized </p><p>that there was a chance to escape before he</p><p>reached the country of the Islinois, especial- </p><p>ly if he agreed to go willingly. These sav- </p><p>ages knew nothing of the use of canoes and </p><p>with his birchbark craft he could outwit or </p><p>outdistance them. </p><p> “I will go with the people of the Islinois,”</p><p>he announced. “I have nothing to fear. I </p><p>would prefer to go among you with goods. </p><p>But it shall be as you wish.” </p><p> The savages proved very friendly but the</p><p>chief never abandoned his suspicions and </p><p>Dick was virtually a prisoner. After the </p><p>Indian custom, he pretended to ignore this, </p><p>acted as if he did not see the precautions </p><p>taken to prevent his escape, and talked and </p><p>joked with the various members of the </p><p>party. </p><p> The savages were not on the war-path, as</p><p>he had known when he first saw them, but </p><p>the reason for their presence so far from </p><p>their home was a mystery until, nearly a </p><p>league farther up the river, the men were </p><p>joined by their families, the women bearing </p><p>heavy burdens, mostly of wild cattle skins </p><p>and robes, leggings and various articles </p><p>made from the hair of the animal. </p><p> Dick was not permitted to go alone in his</p><p>canoe. Three men were placed in it with </p><p>him, among them the chief, and when they </p><p>reached a point opposite the broad plain on </p><p>the east bank the craft was used to trans- </p><p>port the entire party across the stream. </p><p>This required two days, for the savages were </p><p>not accustomed to the use of the canoe and </p><p>the current often carried them far down be- </p><p>fore they could make a landing. </p><p> Once the band was across cabines were</p><p>erected and then began for Dick the strang- </p><p>est scene he had ever witnessed. From up </p><p>the river came a large brigade of canoes </p><p>filled with people of the Ayoe nation. </p><p>They had hardly made themselves at home </p><p>before a still larger number of Nadouais- </p><p>sioux paddled down from the north, whole </p><p>families crowded into smaller canoes than </p><p>Dick had ever seen. </p><p> Mascoutens came down the Ouisconsin</p><p>from the country near Lac Mecheygan, and, </p><p>as the weeks slipped by, Saulteurs from the </p><p>Lac Superior country. Kickapous jour- </p><p>neyed up the Misisepe from the lower</p><p>reaches of the Rocky River and strange </p><p>tribes of which Dick had never heard drifted </p><p>in from the west. A month after the ar- </p><p>rival of the Islinois he estimated that nearly </p><p>five thousand savages were encamped on the </p><p>plain between the river and the bluffs. </p><p> As the number grew Dick began to dread</p><p>each new arrival. Of all the people there he </p><p>was by far the most conspicuous, the most </p><p>talked of. Only a few of the savages had </p><p>ever seen a white man and their interest </p><p>was unending. Whenever a shout went up </p><p>to signal the approach of a new band either </p><p>84 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>by land or water, the Virginian made him- </p><p>self ready. </p><p> Should Ouinibegous venture so far to</p><p>join the conglomerate gathering his situ- </p><p>ation would be serious. Should more </p><p>Islinois come from the village the French- </p><p>men had attempted to plunder his fate </p><p>would be sealed instantly. Should more </p><p>Mascoutens paddle from the upper reaches </p><p>of the Rock River he might be recognized </p><p>and the Islinois’ suspicions confirmed. </p><p> But by mid-May the last of the visitors</p><p>seemed to have arrived. For a week no </p><p>new bands came, and then Dick learned for </p><p>the first time the reason' for this strange </p><p>gathering. The Nadouaissioux brought out </p><p>wild rice and fine, dark furs and traded </p><p>them for buffalo fat. The Ayoes depended </p><p>entirely upon a large supply of soft, red </p><p>stone in their bartering, and so great was </p><p>the desire for this pipe material they reaped </p><p>a large reward in copper from the Saulteurs </p><p>and articles of European manufacture from </p><p>the Mascoutens. </p><p> Each tribe came loaded with the products</p><p>of its own particular country. Copper, </p><p>paintstones, mica, soapstone, jade, flint, </p><p>obsidian and shells were bartered in this </p><p>strange mart. Clam shells from Dick’s own </p><p>Atlantic Ocean, quaintly fringed in bead- </p><p>work, passed from hand to hand here on </p><p>the banks of the great Misisepe and rivaled </p><p>in popularity the obsidian which, the sa- </p><p>vages told him, came from some great </p><p>mountains as far to the westward as the </p><p>salt water lay to the east. </p><p> For each article in this strange collection</p><p>there was a demand. Ayoes took salt- </p><p>water shells with which to make beads in </p><p>their homes far to the west. The Nadouais- </p><p>sioux were glad to get obsidian for the manu- </p><p>facture of spear and arrow heads and knives. </p><p>The Islinois eagerly exchanged woven hair </p><p>goods for copper. There was not a nation </p><p>that did not have a want, nor a nation that </p><p>could not fill it. </p><p> The ground upon which these distant</p><p>peoples gathered was sacred to commerce. </p><p>Even though nations might be at war there </p><p>were no hostilities so long as they remained</p><p>on the prairie between the hills and the </p><p>great river at the mouth of the Ouisconsin. </p><p>Distant tribes mingled freely, without fear </p><p>and without suspicion. Ayoes with the red </p><p>pipestone which could be obtained only in </p><p>their country strolled into the cabines of </p><p>Mascoutens and exchanged it for steel </p><p>knives. Children of the Nadouaissioux </p><p>romped with those of the Islinois. Kicka- </p><p>pou boys shot blackbirds along the river </p><p>banks in company with Saulteur youngsters. </p><p> The Mascoutens had several muskets and</p><p>the Nadouaissioux boasted three or four </p><p>weapons captured a year or two before </p><p>from the Hurons, but they lacked powder </p><p>for them. The Ayoes had never seen fire- </p><p>arms before, nor the Islinois, and Dick made </p><p>the most of his musket. The Islinois, as </p><p>they saw the respect of the other nations for </p><p>their guest, became very proud of him. Al- </p><p>ways he was asked to accompany them on </p><p>their hunts for deer or the wild cattle, and </p><p>the pride with which they afterward exhib- </p><p>ited his game would have been laughable </p><p>to Dick had it not been so valuable. </p><p> Feasts were given continually and in this,</p><p>because of Dick’s musket and his skill in </p><p>hunting, the Islinois easily outdid all other </p><p>nations. Their vanity, naturally great, </p><p>seemed about to burst and the members of </p><p>the tribe secretly discussed the power their </p><p>great nation could wield were they only </p><p>equipped with firearms. They questioned </p><p>Dick as to the possibility of getting them </p><p>and began to boast among themselves of </p><p>their future prowess. </p><p> Their attitude troubled the Virginian for</p><p>he had found them a kindly, generous, </p><p>amiable people and he saw in this new arro- </p><p>gance and vanity the beginning of one of the </p><p>terrible tribal wars. But he could not al- </p><p>low any interest in them to affect his </p><p>chances for freedom and he established him- </p><p>self more firmly in their regard by readily </p><p>promising the white man’s weapons. </p><p> Everything that Dick did or said had be-</p><p>hind it the one idea of escape. Daily he saw </p><p>the fruits of his efforts in the added confi- </p><p>dence with which the Islinois regarded him. </p><p>Only the chief never abated his watchful- </p><p>ness. It was almost as though he had made </p><p>himself responsible to the people of the </p><p>plundered village for Dick’s appearance.</p><p>Always he saw to it that warriors were with </p><p>him and at night a man sat at the door of </p><p>the cabine in which Dick slept. </p><p> One thing, however, gave the Virginian</p><p>hope. The gathering of the strange tribes </p><p>would break up in a few days. Then, in </p><p>the confusion of departure, he would grasp </p><p>any opportunity. The day the Ayoes were </p><p>preparing to leave he began to make de- </p><p>finite plans. </p><p>u But the Islinois, desirous of making one </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>85 </p><p>last impression on the assembled nations, </p><p>had arranged a mammoth feast. A band </p><p>of young men were sent to hunt deer and </p><p>Dick could not afford to arouse their sus- </p><p>picions by refusing to accompany them. As </p><p>usual he remained beside a gully while the </p><p>savages drove the game toward him. In </p><p>this way he had killed four deer by noon </p><p>and the party moved over to another ravine. </p><p>Beside the runway here they found six </p><p>Nadouaissioux who were just about to </p><p>drive the place for themselves. </p><p> The Islinois young men, insolent with the</p><p>pride which had come to the whole band </p><p>and confident in Dick’s musket and their </p><p>own superior numbers, ordered the Na- </p><p>douaissioux out. The savages from the </p><p>north refused and instantly the battle be- </p><p>gan. Dick attempted to prevent the at- </p><p>tack, to make the Islinois see the unreason- </p><p>ableness of their demands. But his efforts </p><p>were unavailing and in less than three </p><p>minutes the six Nadouaissioux lay dead. </p><p> In the exaltation of this achievement the</p><p>Islinois returned with their game and a </p><p>story of how they had punished the insolent </p><p>Nadouaissioux. They were reprimanded </p><p>by the chief and cautioned to keep the </p><p>affair secret. The feast was given that </p><p>night and plans for the entire party to leave </p><p>the next day were hurriedly made. Several </p><p>Nadouaissioux had been invited and the </p><p>Islinois watched them closely for signs that </p><p>the loss of the hunters had become known. </p><p>But the feast passed off without trouble and </p><p>the Islinois, eager to be off, prepared to leave </p><p>at dawn. </p><p>rIN THE confusion resulting from </p><p>the hurried flight Dick believed that </p><p>at last his chance had come. The </p><p>chief, however, detailed two men to guard </p><p>him constantly. No loophole was offered, </p><p>and in the morning the entire band, heavily </p><p>loaded with the results of their bartering, </p><p>began to cross the river. Arrangements had </p><p>been made with the Mascoutens to aid </p><p>with their canoes and in a short time the </p><p>entire party was on the west bank. </p><p> The Islinois had kept a close watch on the</p><p>Nadouaissioux but no signs of hostility or </p><p>suspicion were detected. The Northern</p><p>savages had even appeared to take little </p><p>heed of the departure of the small band </p><p>from the south. </p><p> Once across the river the Islinois pro-</p><p>ceeded down its western bank. The men </p><p>aided with the burdens to make all possible </p><p>haste. At night a strong guard was thrown </p><p>out around their camp and early the second </p><p>morning the march was resumed. </p><p> After three days all fear of pursuit was</p><p>abandoned and they traveled more leisurely. </p><p>In this reaction Dick hoped an opportunity </p><p>for his escape might come, but the chief </p><p>seemed rather to redouble his vigilance. </p><p>In the manner of the savages he sought to </p><p>give the impression that the Virginian was </p><p>an honored guest, one in their care, and to be </p><p>guarded constantly. Politely but brazenly </p><p>he even insisted upon Dick relinquishing </p><p>his musket at night, saying that the weapon </p><p>was too precious to become the loot of a </p><p>thieving Western Indian. </p><p> At the end of the fourth day camp was</p><p>made in a ravine between two steep bluffs </p><p>on the western shore. No one feared the </p><p>Nadouaissioux so far to the south and no </p><p>guards were thrown out. A couple of sentries </p><p>in the camp itself were deemed sufficient. </p><p> It was then that the Nadouaissioux</p><p>struck. In the first light of dawn, when </p><p>sleep was soundest, as early as it was pos- </p><p>sible to distinguish friend from foe, the </p><p>Northern warriors, who all the time had </p><p>been ahead of the Islinois, passing them the </p><p>first night in their canoes, stole close to the </p><p>camp and completely surrounded it, taking </p><p>every precaution to let no one escape. </p><p> So superior were they in numbers and so</p><p>sudden and wholly unexpected was their </p><p>attack, the Islinois were powerless. Those </p><p>who did reach their feet and pick up their </p><p>weapons were struck down at once. Fifteen </p><p>of the forty men were killed and the others, </p><p>seeing themselves at the mercy of the foe, </p><p>surrendered. </p><p> The Nadouaissioux evidently had planned</p><p>to capture Dick alive. His first knowledge </p><p>of the raid was gained from a strong clasp on </p><p>his ankles. He wakened to find a savage at </p><p>each wrist and he lay there without strug- </p><p>gling, watching the Northern Indians</p><p>spread through the encampment, killing all </p><p>those who offered resistance. </p><p> Five minutes after the attack began the</p><p>victors were in complete control and Dick </p><p>shuddered at what was to follow. Twenty- </p><p>five men were prisoners and all the women </p><p>and children of thg party. There could </p><p>only be torture for the first, slavery for the </p><p>others. Dick’s knowledge of savage war- </p><p>fare was extensive and he could conceive of </p><p>no alternative. </p><p>86 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> The leader of the Nadouaissioux ordered</p><p>that Dick be brought to him. He knew </p><p>that the white man could speak both lan- </p><p>guages and he was asked to interpret. To </p><p>Dick’s complete amazement the chief began </p><p>as follows: </p><p> “We learned before the feast given by the</p><p>Islinois what their young men had done. </p><p>When our hunters did not return we went </p><p>to look for them and found their bodies </p><p>and the footprints of the Islinois. And all </p><p>the time we were eating of the meat of the </p><p>Islinois we were thinking of their treachery </p><p>and planning our revenge. For our duty </p><p>was clear and, though we did not wish it </p><p>and have had to travel far out of our way, </p><p>we have come to avenge our dead. We did </p><p>not intend even now to kill any of the </p><p>Islinois. We have done so only when they </p><p>took weapons against us. We want only </p><p>the ten young men who murdered our </p><p>hunters.” </p><p> Dick translated this speech to the pris-</p><p>oners. They, too, were mystified by this </p><p>leniency but instantly they grasped at the </p><p>opportunity to escape. The men began at </p><p>once to point out those who had taken part </p><p>in the attack on the Nadouaissioux and as </p><p>they did so the Northern warriors took them </p><p>aside. Four were among the dead but the </p><p>remaining six were closely guarded. </p><p> “Now,” the Nadouaissioux chief said to</p><p>Dick, “tell the people of the Islinois that </p><p>they may go back to their country but that </p><p>they are to tell their people that we are a </p><p>mighty nation, that we desire to live at </p><p>peace with our neighbors, but that treachery </p><p>is never permitted to go unavenged.” </p><p> Dick translated the speech and the Islin-</p><p>ois, as if in a trance, prepared for their de- </p><p>parture. The Virginian was equally dazed </p><p>by this unheard of toleration on the part of a </p><p>band of savages and as he began to see that </p><p>it was real, sincere, not intended as a cloak </p><p>to hide another attack, he imagined that his </p><p>own opportunity had come. His canoe </p><p>was at the river bank. The Islinois were </p><p>forced to travel by land. By night he </p><p>would be fifteen or twenty leagues in the </p><p>lead and speeding toward Virginia. </p><p> In his eagerness to be off he turned to get</p><p>his musket. The chief of the Nadouais- </p><p>sioux stepped in front of him, his hand up- </p><p>raised. </p><p> “The white man will come with our</p><p>people,” ne said. </p><p> “But I had nothing to do with the killing</p><p>of your young men,” protested the Virginian. </p><p>“I am not like the Islinois, who killed for </p><p>the love of the killing.” </p><p> “We know,” answered the chief sternly,</p><p>“that you were present at the slaughter of </p><p>our hunters.” </p><p> “Did you see the bodies?” asked Dick</p><p>scornfully. “Did you find holes in them </p><p>made by the white man’s arrows?” </p><p> “We saw the bodies,” answered the chief</p><p>solemnly, “and we did not find holes made </p><p>by the arrows of the white man. But we </p><p>do not think the white man is a fool and a </p><p>hatchet hangs from his belt.” </p><p> Dick drew the little ax from its loop and</p><p>handed it to the chief. </p><p> “Can you find blood upon it?” he de-</p><p>manded. “Did you see a mark on your </p><p>dead that was not made by the war-clubs of </p><p>the Islinois?” </p><p> “We only know that the white man was</p><p>there,” was the answer as the chief turned </p><p>away to order his warriors to prepare for the </p><p>journey to the prairie at the mouth of the </p><p>Ouisconsin. </p><p> Dick was frantic in his despair. Not</p><p>once during his captivity among the Islinois </p><p>had he relinquished the thought of escape. </p><p>Always he had planned on the moment when </p><p>the vigilance of the chief would be relaxed, </p><p>when his attention would be taken by other </p><p>matters. Now when the moment had </p><p>arrived there had come this new blow to his </p><p>plans. It was unthinkable. </p><p> As he stood there, dazed by this new turn</p><p>of affairs it was not fear that he felt but hot </p><p>resentment that the decision of one petty </p><p>chief of a band of savages should thus de- </p><p>feat the success of his great mision, should </p><p>render impossible the gift that he could</p><p>make to his own people. </p><p> The Nadouaissioux, he knew, lived far</p><p>to the north, west of Lac Superior, far be- </p><p>yond the limits of the country known to the </p><p>coureurs de bois. If he were to make his </p><p>long journey to Virginia before Winter he </p><p>must start at once. To go with this band </p><p>to their home in the north meant, even </p><p>should he escape later, that it would be </p><p>impossible to reach Virginia before the </p><p>Winter snows. </p><p> The knowledge threw Dick into a fresh</p><p>rage and he ran after the chief to protest </p><p>again. He argued, pleaded, threatened the </p><p>wrath of the king of France, an avenging </p><p>army of white men. But the Nadouais- </p><p>sioux only smiled. In the end Dick was </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>87 </p><p>forced into a canoe and the entire party </p><p>started up-stream. Again Virginia faded </p><p>into the distance. </p><p>CHAPTER XIII . </p><p>THE EXECUTION </p><p>WHEN the Nadouaissioux war-party </p><p>started northward on the Misisepe </p><p>the Islinois prisoners were forced to do </p><p>their share of the paddling. The Southern </p><p>savages were so unskilful their captors </p><p>laughed and jeered at their clumsy efforts. </p><p>Dick, adept as he was in a canoe, escaped </p><p>this but he marveled at the ability of the </p><p>Northerners in handling their little craft. </p><p>Only three or four men could find room in </p><p>one, but they fairly lifted them from the </p><p>water as they shot up-stream. </p><p> The mouth of the Ouisconsin was reached</p><p>on the afternoon of the second day and the </p><p>great prairie was found to be deserted by </p><p>all except the families of the Nadouaissioux. </p><p>The thousands of savages who had come </p><p>for the annual bartering had dispersed to </p><p>their homes and the Nadouaissioux them- </p><p>selves were ready for departure the next </p><p>morning. </p><p> The desperate position in which Dick</p><p>found himself drove him to renew his </p><p>protests against being carried away with </p><p>them, although before he began he felt </p><p>the futility of his words. This time he </p><p>did not plead or threaten. Rather he </p><p>argued with all the eloquence at his com- </p><p>mand. </p><p> He pointed out that the French, of</p><p>whom they believed him one, would surely </p><p>hear of this action and that no traders </p><p>would dare to venture among them and </p><p>carry to them the white man’s weapons, </p><p>for which they were so desirous. He felt </p><p>that he scored here but, although he </p><p>watched their faces closely, he was unable </p><p>to learn anything as to the weight of his </p><p>argument. They met this as they had all </p><p>else that he had said in silence, a silence </p><p>that was maddening because it told nothing. </p><p> His failure even to elicit a reply convinced</p><p>the Virginian that success must lie in his</p><p>ability to slip away, to steal a canoe and </p><p>paddle down the Misisepe. The attit-de </p><p>of the Nadouaissioux encouraged him in </p><p>this, for while daylight lasted at the </p><p>bartering-place there were no guards ap- </p><p>pointed. To all outward appearances the </p><p>prisoners could go and come as they </p><p>pleased, though none was unwise enough </p><p>to wander far from the center of the camp. </p><p>Every woman and child was in reality a </p><p>watchful sentry and a hundred warriors </p><p>would respond instantly to the first alarm. </p><p> With the coming of darkness all oppor-</p><p>tunity of escape vanished, however. Dick </p><p>and the six other prisoners were placed in a </p><p>cabine and a dozen armed warriors took up </p><p>their station outside. </p><p> The Islinois apparently went to sleep</p><p>instantly, but Dick lay awake for a long </p><p>time. Now that he realized that escape </p><p>was hopeless for the present he reviewed </p><p>the situation more carefully. From the </p><p>direction in which the Misisepe flowed and </p><p>from the information he had received from </p><p>the savages and Antoine Goddin, he </p><p>believed that the Ohio of the Iroquois </p><p>joined the “great water” not far from the </p><p>place where he had left it on his journey </p><p>from Virginia. This convinced him that </p><p>the best way back to the colony was to go </p><p>down the Misisepe until he came to the </p><p>Ohio, then eastward on the route by which </p><p>he had come. </p><p> If his deductions were correct only three</p><p>or four months would be ample for the </p><p>journey, provided always that he met no </p><p>hostile nations and was not made prisoner </p><p>again. It was now the first of June. He </p><p>would dare start as late as the first of </p><p>August. That would give him two months </p><p>in which to make good his escape. </p><p> The knowledge brought relief from the</p><p>first incoherent feeling of the need of </p><p>desperate haste. Now he could plan care- </p><p>fully, calmly, and, he told himself, success- </p><p>fully. When the two months were up, </p><p>or before, he resolved that he would be on </p><p>his way to Virginia to do the thing he had </p><p>promised himself that he would do. </p><p> With these two months in view he laid</p><p>his plans. He would appear to submit </p><p>to his captivity among the Nadouaissioux.</p><p>This alone would not deceive them and </p><p>he must find some method of convincing </p><p>the savages that he had no desire to leave. </p><p>Even if he journeyed far north with them </p><p>they undoubtedly would remain on or </p><p>near the Misisepe and, down-stream, he </p><p>could quickly regain the lost ground. </p><p> Dick was not foolish enough to announce</p><p>his submission at once. Only by his </p><p>manner did he appear content to start </p><p>northward the next morning. He took his </p><p>88 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>place in his own canoe, paddled as hard as </p><p>any of the women, and even sang a song </p><p>or two as he toiled. The Nadouaissioux </p><p>did not ill-treat their prisoners but that the </p><p>deaths of the young men were not being </p><p>forgotten was evident in the almost con- </p><p>tinuous weeping. </p><p> In fact, when camp was made, weeping,</p><p>Dick believed, was the principal occupation </p><p>of men, women and children. Culinary </p><p>duties were neglected the first night while </p><p>the whole band shed tears. Never before </p><p>had Dick seen more or greater expressions </p><p>of sorrow, and his own heart was moved </p><p>until he heard one warrior, whose eyes were </p><p>fairly raining tears, relate a humorous story </p><p>of the bartering-place. </p><p> Even the Islinois, who could speak only</p><p>with Dick because of the complete dis- </p><p>similarity of the languages, were struck </p><p>by this ability to shed tears at will. But </p><p>more than anything else the Southern </p><p>savages spoke of the toleration of their </p><p>captors and, after the second day of the </p><p>northward journey they all began to share </p><p>the hope that they might be held as slaves </p><p>and adopted into the nation. </p><p> The evening of the third day the canoes</p><p>reached a second prairie on the east bank </p><p>of the river, one fully as large as that just </p><p>above the mouth of the Ouisconsin. The </p><p>great bluffs continued on either side, though </p><p>here for the first time a valley stretched </p><p>away to the eastward between the hills </p><p>and a small river flowed in to join the </p><p>Misisepe. Here the party camped for the </p><p>night. </p><p> The next morning Dick found that the</p><p>Nadouaissioux were not preparing to depart. </p><p>The weeping habit had been revived and </p><p>when he left the cabine in which he had slept </p><p>the entire band was shedding tears. The </p><p>kindly attitude of the savages had van- </p><p>ished, too, and as Dick started to walk </p><p>away one of the guards thrust him back </p><p>through the door. A few minutes later all </p><p>seven prisoners were marched forth and, </p><p>surrounded by the guards and followed by </p><p>the entire band, led to a grove of trees near </p><p>the river bank. There the chief made a </p><p>speech which he asked Dick to translate</p><p>to the Islinois. </p><p> “Six of our hunters were slain by the</p><p>people of the Islinois and the white man </p><p>who was with them,” he began. “Our </p><p>young men were hunting the deer, with no </p><p>thought of war or murder. Our people </p><p>went to the baxtering-place with no evil </p><p>thoughts for any other people. VVe kept </p><p>the truce which has existed on the prairie </p><p>at the Rivers Ouisconsin and Misisepe ever </p><p>since our oldest men can remember. Never </p><p>have we mblested our deadliest foes while </p><p>gathered there. </p><p> “The young men of the Islinois forgot</p><p>their duty, their reverence for the spirits </p><p>that guard the place. Without cause they </p><p>slew our young men. </p><p> “There have come to us stories of how</p><p>the people living far to the east near the </p><p>stinking water take prisoners and tie them </p><p>to stakes, how they burn and slash them, </p><p>cut off their noses and ears, hold hot stones </p><p>to their breasts, gouge out their eyes, thrust </p><p>splinters of pine into their flesh and set </p><p>them afire. We have heard that they tie </p><p>them to stakes in the ground and roast off </p><p>their feet and legs, that they tear out their </p><p>finger-nails, that they butcher them as </p><p>they never would butcher the wild cattle </p><p>or the deer or the moose. </p><p> “All these ways are strange to our people.</p><p>We find no pleasure in them. We live </p><p>peaceably among ourselves and our neigh- </p><p>bors. But we are not a timid race.” </p><p> He waited for Dick to tell the Islinois</p><p>what he had said and then continued: </p><p> “In a war we are not afraid to fight, as</p><p>our enemies have learned, but once we </p><p>have won we are generous. We like to </p><p>show that, though we are victors, we bear </p><p>no ill-will toward the vanquished. It is </p><p>even the custom of our people when we are </p><p>at war with another nation and take pris- </p><p>oners to send them back to their own </p><p>people.” </p><p>HE PAUSED and nodded toward </p><p>Dick, who repeated his words to </p><p>the other prisoners. The Vir- </p><p>ginian spoke as fully as the chief, even added </p><p>a few words because of his own dawning</p><p>hope that after all they were to be released. </p><p>The temperate words and even tone of the </p><p>chief were inexplicable in the light of what </p><p>Dick knew of savage revenge and savage </p><p>torture. </p><p> But Antoine Goddin had told him that</p><p>the Sioux were unlike any other savage </p><p>nation. Their leniency toward the band </p><p>of Islinois, their treatment of prisoners </p><p>and now the magnanimous tone of the </p><p>chief, all confirmed this report, and in the </p><p>face of it all Dick could only conclude that </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>89 </p><p>they neither wished nor intended to detain </p><p>him longer. </p><p> When he had translated, the chief con-</p><p>tinued: </p><p> “We are now three days’ journey from</p><p>the prairie where all the nations barter </p><p>each year. We are approaching our own </p><p>country, even now are on its borders. </p><p>We have with us the six Islinois and the </p><p>white man who killed our young men. </p><p>They killed them, not in war but with evil </p><p>minds and for an evil purpose. Under </p><p>such conditions it is our duty as well as our </p><p>desire that they die. We do not wish that </p><p>they die as do the prisoners of the nations </p><p>to the east. We are brave enough without • </p><p>eating their hearts and drinking their blood </p><p>to add to our own courage. But they must </p><p>die as is the custom of our people.” </p><p> Dick, his face pale, his eyes staring, was</p><p>too stunned by this announcement to turn </p><p>away from the chief. The instant before </p><p>he had seen liberty, a quick departure. </p><p>Now he stood face to face with death. </p><p> “Is the white man afraid to die for the</p><p>deaths he caused?” asked the chief scorn- </p><p>fully. “Is his heart as white as his skin?” </p><p> Dick’s fear was not so much for himself,</p><p>though he was young and death could never </p><p>come easily. But his soul rebelled at this </p><p>blasting of his hopes, at a fate which hinged </p><p>so great an enterprise upon so inconse- </p><p>quential a thing. </p><p> Partly in English, partly in Nadouais-</p><p>sioux, he protested his innocence, stormed </p><p>against the injustice of their action, threat- </p><p>ened with the direst consequences his </p><p>imagination could arouse. </p><p> But even as he raved and swore in the</p><p>face of the chief and the leading men of the </p><p>band who were gathered before him he read </p><p>the uselessness of his words. </p><p> “The white man talks in vain,” inter-</p><p>rupted the chief sharply. </p><p> As Dick, inarticulate, with working lips</p><p>and dazed brain, stood staring at the</p><p>savages the death scene of Antoine Goddin </p><p>came to him as if it were a vision, as if a </p><p>spirit had suddenly appeared to rebuke him. </p><p>He saw the bank of the Ouisconsin where </p><p>his friend had died, saw him lying there </p><p>at the foot of the great oak, his face calm, </p><p>his eyes brave to the end. </p><p> The Frenchman’s words returned with all</p><p>their simple courage. Antoine had played </p><p>a dangerous game in a far land. He had </p><p>weighed his chances, taken his risks, that </p><p>the great object might be obtained. He </p><p>had died like a man dies when he knows </p><p>that the balance has swung the other way </p><p>and the lips that had finally closed were </p><p>curseless. </p><p> Dick recoiled before a comparison of the</p><p>Frenchman’s words and actions and his </p><p>own. If he, too, must relinquish his work </p><p>to those who would follow, at least he could </p><p>do it with the same quiet courage. He </p><p>turned suddenly to the waiting Islinois. </p><p>Head up, eyes bright and steady, his voice </p><p>clear and unfaltering, he repeated the last </p><p>words of the chief’s message and then faced </p><p>the Nadouaissioux to await the end. </p><p> Immediately one of the Islinois was led</p><p>away from the others and tied to a tree. </p><p>Before him all the boys of the village lined </p><p>up, their bows drawn, arrows in place. </p><p>No sooner had the guards stepped back </p><p>than the flint-tipped shafts were drawn. </p><p>There was a twanging of tjow strings. The </p><p>next moment a hail of arrows struck the </p><p>prisoner. </p><p> Like a human porcupine he stood there,</p><p>arrows impaled in every part of his chest, </p><p>abdomen and arms. But he still lived, for </p><p>the boys’ arms had not been strong enough. </p><p>Almost instantly, however, other arrows </p><p>had been fitted to the bows and a second </p><p>flight clattered among the shafts already </p><p>imbedded. The body of the prisoner sagged </p><p>in its bonds and his head fell forward. Sev- </p><p>eral warriors ran up and cut the dead man </p><p>loose. The body was thrown into the river. </p><p> A second Islinois was bound to the tree and</p><p>he, too, lived until the second flight of arrows. </p><p> The third walked up proudly and was</p><p>rewarded by a bit of flint entering his eye </p><p>and piercing his brain, bringing instant</p><p>death. The boy who had fired the arrow </p><p>ran forward and drew it out with a shrill </p><p>cry, and there were grunts of approval from </p><p>the warriors. </p><p> The boys of the band were now hysterical</p><p>in their excitement and danced impatiently </p><p>while the fourth victim was led out. They </p><p>selected their arrows with care and crowded </p><p>each other to get the most advantageous </p><p>positions. As a result of their excitement </p><p>the Islinois did not die until the fourth </p><p>volley and more than a hundred and fifty </p><p>shafts were imbedded in his flesh. His </p><p>bonds were cut and he fell forward, driving </p><p>a score of arrows entirely through his body. </p><p> Dick, the spell of Goddin’s death scene</p><p>still upon him, stood calmly in his place. </p><p>90 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>He watched each successive victim as he </p><p>was led forward, saw the swift flight of the </p><p>arrows, heard the body splash into the </p><p>waters of the great river. </p><p> The fifth Islinois died with the third</p><p>flight of arrows from the boys and only one </p><p>remained before Dick’s turn would come, </p><p>for they were evidently holding him for the </p><p>last. The sixth was led forward and one </p><p>youngster, edging ahead of the others and </p><p>not waiting until the guards had retreated </p><p>from the tree, let fly an arrow which cleanly </p><p>entered the victim’s mouth. </p><p> A roar of laughter swept over the men</p><p>and women and the other boys, incensed </p><p>that one of their number had taken an </p><p>advantage, fell to arguing among them- </p><p>selves. Laughter convulsed the savages as </p><p>they stared at the victim, a shaft protruding </p><p>from his mouth, a thin line of blood running </p><p>down his chin. </p><p> At last, one by one, then two and three</p><p>at a time, the boys began drawing their </p><p>bows again. There was a twang, a slight </p><p>hiss as the feathered shaft twisted in its </p><p>flight and, miraculously itseemed, another ar- </p><p>row suddenly appeared in the prisoner’s flesh. </p><p> Quickly the number increased. Blood</p><p>drenched the savage’s naked chest and </p><p>ran in streams down his legs. He stood </p><p>there, head erect, eyes unblinking, and still </p><p>the bows twanged until it seemed that there </p><p>was not room for another arrow above his </p><p>waist. Then simultaneously two shafts </p><p>struck his eyes and his head fell forward. </p><p> Beginning with the laughter over the</p><p>first arrow ‘ protruding from the man’s </p><p>mouth and the excitement and quarrel </p><p>of the youthful executioners, the slow death </p><p>of the last of the Islinois had wrought up </p><p>the entire band. Men and women shrieked </p><p>and yelled and danced about, but the </p><p>instant the prisoner was killed everything </p><p>was quiet. </p><p> Dick, fascinated by the spectacle, was</p><p>the last to realize the sudden stillness and </p><p>as he looked around he found every person </p><p>staring at him. The boys, nervous, eager, </p><p>were fitting their best arrows to their bows.</p><p>CHAPTER XIV </p><p>A NADOUAISSIOUX </p><p>FOR a moment Dick had the impulse to </p><p>turn upon his captors, to attack his </p><p>guards barehanded, to run amuck among </p><p>them and compel a quick death. It was </p><p>not that he believed he might escape, that </p><p>he might compel acknowledgment of his </p><p>courage. It was simply the white man’s </p><p>way to die. The savage is schooled through </p><p>the generations to die haughtily, even at </p><p>the stake. The white man must go out </p><p>in a blaze of fierce endeavor and action. </p><p> Even as he turned and saw that he could</p><p>easily grasp the war club of a man near him </p><p>he knew that he would not try. He had </p><p>chosen a life among the savages, had chosen </p><p>to play their game. He would follow it </p><p>to the end and die according to their custom. </p><p>Though he were white, he could do no more </p><p>here than die as dies the savage. </p><p> In the silence that had descended upon</p><p>the crowd the young Virginian turned </p><p>toward the guards and held out his hands. </p><p>They stepped toward him, grasped his </p><p>wrists and led him to the tree. </p><p> The boys, their youthful minds inflamed</p><p>during the execution of the six Islinois, </p><p>hysterical even in the unusual excitement, </p><p>were silent and nervous while the white </p><p>man was bound. Here was unknown </p><p>game. Here was flesh their flint and </p><p>obsidian had never penetrated. Here was </p><p>a representative of that unknown and </p><p>mysterious race who drove their arrows </p><p>with thunder, who made keen tools of iron, </p><p>and who came from a marvelous land far </p><p>beyond the stinking water. </p><p> The youngsters did not falter, did not</p><p>shrink from the task before them, but their </p><p>bows trembled and there was an unnatural </p><p>stiffness in their bearing as they stood </p><p>ready. </p><p> In that nervous condition Dick saw that</p><p>what he most dreaded would be inevitable. </p><p>If the boys were cool and unexcited death </p><p>would be quick. In their present state the </p><p>prolonged agony of the Islinois would be </p><p>nothing with what he must suffer. The</p><p>thought of numberless arrows sticking into </p><p>his flesh, none with force enough to bring </p><p>the end, was maddening, and impulsively </p><p>he began to speak. </p><p> “Listen!” he called in a loud voice.</p><p> The half-drawn bows of the boys straight-</p><p>ened. There was a quick movement of the </p><p>crowd toward him. </p><p> “Though I am a white man I can die as</p><p>well as can your own people,” the Vir- </p><p>ginian said. “But I have lived as a man </p><p>and I wish to die as a man. When I fought </p><p>I fought as a man, in the open, face to face </p><p>with my enemy. That is the way the </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>91 </p><p>white man wants to die, facing his enemy, </p><p>not a crowd of children with their child’s </p><p>weapons. </p><p> “You are not my enemies. I have never</p><p>harmed you. But you think I have and </p><p>you are going to kill me. You are a big </p><p>people and a just people, slow to anger, and </p><p>I know that you will grant the wish of a </p><p>man who is about to die.” </p><p> “What is the white man’s wish?” asked</p><p>the chief when Dick paused. </p><p> “Send those children to their mothers’</p><p>skirts!” he cried fiercely. “Put men in their </p><p>places. Let men’s bows be drawn, not bows </p><p>that are used to kill blackbirds along the </p><p>river. That is what I ask.” </p><p> It was a demand rather than a request.</p><p>Its effect was apparent. The men began </p><p>to speak in whispers among themselves. </p><p>The chief waved the boys back. The </p><p>warriors seemed naturally to form a large </p><p>circle. Several began preparations to make </p><p>speeches, but an old man, stiff from years </p><p>of hunting and fighting and exposure, </p><p>stepped forward and began to address </p><p>them. </p><p> “You all know me,” he said. “You all</p><p>know that my loss in the treachery of the </p><p>Islinois was double that of any one else. </p><p>You know that my two sons, the only </p><p>children I had, the only support of an old </p><p>man and their mother, were killed. You </p><p>know that I face my old age without the </p><p>comfort and care of children, that I am </p><p>doomed to loneliness and sorrow until the </p><p>end. I am like the broken reed in the river </p><p>in the moon of the rut of the moose. The </p><p>winds and the currents have their will with </p><p>me. I am too weak to hold against them. </p><p> “The white man we hold as prisoner was</p><p>present when my sons were killed by the </p><p>treacherous Islinois. He says he tried to </p><p>prevent the murder. From his actions </p><p>today I would believe him. But, whether </p><p>he is guilty or not, he was there. He was </p><p>with the Islinois, came to the bartering- </p><p>place with them, was with the hunting- </p><p>party that brought so much sorrow to us. </p><p> “The white man has shown himself to be</p><p>brave. He has looked upon death with </p><p>steady eyes and firm lips. He has shown </p><p>that he can die as we would all like to die. </p><p> “He has the bow that kills with thunder</p><p>arrows. He has a hatchet and knife of iron, </p><p>while we have only stone. He can paddle </p><p>and he can hunt. </p><p> “My people, I want this young man for</p><p>a son. I need him to provide-for me in </p><p>my old age, to kill moose and beaver that </p><p>I may not starve, to bring skins that I may </p><p>not freeze. I wish to take him into my </p><p>home, to call him son and have him call </p><p>me father. The white man and the </p><p>Islinois robbed me of all that I have. Let </p><p>them give back what they can.” </p><p> As the old man took his seat in the circle</p><p>and the customary silence ensued, Dick </p><p>looked eagerly at the faces of the warriors. </p><p>He knew the savages often adopted pris- </p><p>oners into their own families to take the </p><p>places of those slain in war. The Iroquois </p><p>had kept their ranks full by adopting entire </p><p>tribes. </p><p> But what gave him the greatest hope</p><p>was the fact that a prisoner thus adopted </p><p>never endeavors to return to his own people. </p><p>It is the accepted belief that he has died, </p><p>that his former existence has ended and </p><p>that into his body has come the spirit of </p><p>the slain warrior whose place he lakes. </p><p>Once adopted, Dick knew that the Na- </p><p>douaissioux would not question his accept- </p><p>ance of the savage theory but would treat </p><p>him immediately as one of the band, would </p><p>permit him to go and come as he pleased. </p><p>And that would mean Virginia before the </p><p>Winter snows. </p><p> Other warriors, leaders in the band, arose</p><p>and spoke briefly. Dick, straining against </p><p>his bonds, listened eagerly to every word. </p><p>Not one showed a desire to thwart the </p><p>request of the old man. Only additional </p><p>reasons for the adoption of the captive </p><p>were proposed. </p><p> At the end the chief nodded and several</p><p>young men ran to the tree to sever the </p><p>thongs that bound the Virginian to it. </p><p>He was escorted into the circle and formally </p><p>presented to the father whose sons had been</p><p>slain. And so, with a few simple cere- </p><p>monies and much smoking of the calumet, </p><p>Dick Jeffreys became a Nadouaissioux. </p><p> In the three days that the band remained</p><p>on the prairie the Virginian devoted him- </p><p>self to establishing firmly the belief that he </p><p>had taken the place of the sons who were </p><p>slain. The morning after the execution of </p><p>the Islinois he went off early with his </p><p>musket, and alone. He crossed the prairie </p><p>to a great, rock-crowned bluff and followed </p><p>its base into the valley which opened to </p><p>the east. </p><p> He went on into this for more than a</p><p>league and, by sheer luck, encountered a </p><p>92 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>small herd of wild cattle in a wooded valley. </p><p>He crept close, killed a huge bull at the first </p><p>shot and loaded again in time to kill another </p><p>before the herd stampeded. Then, loading </p><p>as he ran, he climbed the side and met the </p><p>galloping animals face to face as they </p><p>rounded the end of the ridge. A third </p><p>went down and, before the last were out of </p><p>range, a fourth was mortally wounded. </p><p> The buffalo had turned toward the west</p><p>and as Dick made his way back to the </p><p>encampment he encountered them again, </p><p>getting two more and finishing the one he </p><p>had wounded. He then hurried back to </p><p>the savages and asked that the women </p><p>be sent out after the meat. At night, </p><p>when they returned, a hundred of them </p><p>each carrying all the meat her strength </p><p>permitted, the camp was in an uproar. </p><p>In the feast that followed Dick was ac- </p><p>corded the place of honor. </p><p> The band moved on up the river. Once</p><p>they found a herd of buffalo swimming the </p><p>stream and again Dick’s musket won </p><p>respect. The grief-stricken father who </p><p>had adopted him strutted about the camp </p><p>and boasted of his son’s prowess. The </p><p>boys who would have slain him a few days </p><p>before followed him in awe. The old men </p><p>of the band accorded his every word their </p><p>closest attention. His counsel was invited </p><p>and respected. </p><p>DICK did not overlook any oppor- </p><p>tunities to cement his hold upon </p><p>the Nadouaissioux. He found them </p><p>entirely different from any savages he had </p><p>ever encountered. They were mild, pleas- </p><p>ant, amiable people. The men were tall </p><p>and well formed, though the women were </p><p>more ugly than is usually the case with </p><p>savages. Every member of the band, even </p><p>to the infants, began the day with a bath </p><p>in the river. </p><p> The Virginian easily fell into their mode</p><p>of life, quickly adopted all their customs, </p><p>established the best of terms with the men, </p><p>and in a week he was, to all outward </p><p>appearances, a savage. </p><p> Yet not once in all that time did he forget</p><p>the one thing that prompted these actions.</p><p>He studied the canoes, which were smaller </p><p>and lighter than his own and better adapted </p><p>to his long journey. He even chose the </p><p>one he would take when he made his dash </p><p>to the southward. </p><p> He strolled about the camp after dark,</p><p>learning the habits of the various individual </p><p>members of the band, noting the hour when </p><p>they retired, marking down those who were </p><p>prone to sit late about a fire and gossip. </p><p>He made friends with the numberless </p><p>dogs of the encampment, surreptitiously </p><p>tossed them pieces of meat and then tested </p><p>them by walking through the camp at </p><p>night. </p><p> He was up at dawn, watching to see</p><p>which members of the band were the earliest </p><p>risers. When he had learned who each </p><p>was he began to express a choice in the </p><p>location of his own cabine at night that, </p><p>when he had gone, his absence might be </p><p>discovered as late as possible. </p><p> A week after he had been adopted Dick</p><p>decided that the first cloudy night.would </p><p>suffice for his attempt. Every detail which </p><p>could insure success had been planned. </p><p>He had secreted a supply of dried meat </p><p>and wild oats on the bank to be picked up </p><p>on his return, had chosen two good paddles, </p><p>and selected a small, narrow canoe capable </p><p>of unusual speed. </p><p> The morning of the eighth day after his</p><p>adoption the band began its leisurely jour- </p><p>ney northward in a fine drizzle. The low </p><p>clouds drifted before a south wind. There </p><p>was every indication that they would </p><p>hang low through the night at least. Dick </p><p>recognized his chance and resolved to take </p><p>it. In that swift current he could travel </p><p>twenty-four hours a day, sleeping in the </p><p>bottom of the canoe as he had done on the </p><p>Ouisconsin. </p><p> He should gain at least twelve hours’</p><p>start, perhaps more, and in that twelve </p><p>hours he could gain twenty-five leagues. </p><p>His pursuers, when they came, would </p><p>travel faster, but his experience with the </p><p>Ouinibegous had given him confidence and </p><p>he knew that the Nadouaissioux would not </p><p>dare venture too far south for fear of the </p><p>Islinois. </p><p> As Dick, paddling unconsciously, went</p><p>over and over his plans the leading canoes </p><p>passed out of sight around a bend. When </p><p>he suddenly became aware of his surround- </p><p>ings he found that, less than an hour after </p><p>the start, the fleet of birchbarks had strung </p><p>out along the shore of a large lake. </p><p> With the south wind helping, the</p><p>Nadouaissioux made all possible speed. </p><p>The lake was more than ten leagues long, </p><p>Dick was told, and the high bluffs on either </p><p>side were the home of fierce winds that </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>93 </p><p>always lay in wait for the savages that </p><p>they might devour the canoes. Men, </p><p>women and children showed their fear by </p><p>paddling swiftly. It seemed to be the </p><p>desire of every one to cross the lake as </p><p>quickly as possible. </p><p> Half a league out Dick found to his</p><p>dismay that the current had ceased. </p><p>The lake was only an enlargement of the </p><p>great stream, but it was a lake. Should </p><p>the south wind hold he could make no </p><p>more than a league an hour against it. </p><p>The great lead he had counted upon would </p><p>be cut in half. He might not be able even </p><p>to get off the lake before he would be </p><p>seen. </p><p> Though he cursed himself for not having</p><p>begun his dash the night before, for not </p><p>having made inquiries as to the route </p><p>ahead, there was nothing to do except </p><p>go on. He was trapped and all he could </p><p>hope for was a fiercer wind that would </p><p>drive the savages to camp on the western </p><p>shore. Then, with only a small stretch </p><p>of the lake between him and the river, </p><p>he could get away. </p><p> The wind did increase, driving the</p><p>canoes before it, sending the water swishing </p><p>and surging alongside in curling rollers. </p><p>Dick’s heart leaped at each successive </p><p>blast, but the savages kept on, paddling </p><p>harder, shouting hopefully to one another. </p><p>A race was on, a race between the wind </p><p>and mounting seas and the canoes, with </p><p>the finish line a point setting out from the </p><p>western shore, around which there would </p><p>be shelter. </p><p> Dick kept on with the others, his foster-</p><p>parents paddling with amazing strength, </p><p>looking anxiously over their shoulders at </p><p>the storm clouds behind them. Dick </p><p>prayed that they would lose, begrudged </p><p>each league that slipped behind them, </p><p>was incensed that the wind did not make </p><p>further progress too dangerous. He began </p><p>to see that the entire success of his plan </p><p>depended upon being driven ashore before </p><p>the shelter of the distant point was </p><p>reached. </p><p> But the wind settled to a steady blow,</p><p>the little canoes rose and fell with the </p><p>rollers in safety, and at noon the entire </p><p>fleet had rounded the point and stopped </p><p>to rest in its shelter. From the point </p><p>Dick could see the end of the lake about </p><p>three leagues to the northwest, across a </p><p>broad expanse of water. The lake would </p><p>require a whole night’s strenuous paddling </p><p>under favorable conditions, he estimated, </p><p>and if the wind kept up he could not hope </p><p>to get out of sight. </p><p> The savages, after a rest, started on.</p><p>They kept close to the west shore, out of </p><p>the wind, but each member of the band </p><p>had a watchful eye on the clouds. Their </p><p>fear of the lake and the storms that swept </p><p>it kept them working steadily and when </p><p>sunset came they had reached the mouth </p><p>of the river. </p><p> The land was low, swampy, the stream</p><p>divided into many channels, and as the </p><p>great fleet left the lake it separated into </p><p>three divisions. Dick and his foster- </p><p>parents were with a score of canoes that </p><p>entered a swift, narrow place bordered </p><p>by high rushes. Tired by their strenuous </p><p>exertions since morning, they made head- </p><p>way with difficulty. The channel nar- </p><p>rowed, the current became more swift, </p><p>dusk was settling over the water. </p><p> Then suddenly out of the reeds on either</p><p>side darted a flotilla of small canoes, each </p><p>manned by four naked, painted, whooping </p><p>savages. </p><p> Arrows fairly rained upon the Nadouais-</p><p>sioux. Many were wounded. Paddles </p><p>dropped from nerveless hands and floated </p><p>off down-stream. One canoe overturned </p><p>and the heads of children bobbed in the </p><p>current. Shrill yells came across the </p><p>marshes, indicating that the attack was </p><p>simultaneous in all the channels. </p><p> As Dick saw the canoes dash out from</p><p>both sides his first thought was to flee. </p><p>Whoever the attackers were, it was not </p><p>his battle. But before he could turn his </p><p>craft the enemy were among the Nadouais- </p><p>sioux and war-clubs were swinging right </p><p>and left. One canoe dashed straight toward </p><p>Dick’s and he laid aside his paddle for his </p><p>musket and fired into the face of the leading </p><p>savage just as he was about to brain his</p><p>foster-mother. </p><p> The two canoes swung together broad-</p><p>side. A war-club crashed into the skull </p><p>of Dick’s foster-father. The Virginian </p><p>whirled his musket and knocked the second </p><p>savage into the water, but before he could </p><p>recover his balance the third brought down </p><p>his club. </p><p> Dick swerved, it caught him a glanc-</p><p>ing blow on the side of 'the head, and </p><p>he fell unconscious upon the body of the </p><p>old Nadouaissioux. </p><p>94 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>CHAPTER XV </p><p>THE PROMISE </p><p>THE war-party of the Otjibwa, known </p><p>to the French as the Saulteurs because </p><p>they were first found at the Sault Ste. </p><p>Marie, numbered less than half as many </p><p>men as the Nadouaissioux, but their attack </p><p>was so sudden and so wholly unexpected, </p><p>and the Nadouaissioux were at such a </p><p>disadvantage, the slaughter was terrific </p><p>for a time. The savages from Lac Superior </p><p>cracked heads wherever they showed, male, </p><p>female or infant, and the early darkness </p><p>alone saved their victims from complete </p><p>annihilation. </p><p> That Dick Jeffreys lived was due to the</p><p>quick wit of his foster-mother. The canoes </p><p>of the attacking party had swept past when </p><p>she found herself alone in the bow of their </p><p>craft and she immediately turned, drove </p><p>across the current and hid in the reeds. </p><p>Sounds of the battle came from down- </p><p>stream and both sides but soon died away </p><p>as the current swept every one out into </p><p>the lake. The old woman judged that </p><p>none remained between her and the upper </p><p>river and stealthily she shoved out and </p><p>began to paddle northward. </p><p> The clouds were low, the darkness intense.</p><p>The river mouth was a vast marsh. High </p><p>reeds bordered the narrow channels and </p><p>islands were numerous. The old woman </p><p>knew every nook of the river and in two </p><p>hours she had traveled so far from the lake </p><p>she dared go ashore and ascertain if her </p><p>men were, dead or only wounded. She </p><p>turned her canoe into a tree-roofed slough </p><p>and crept forward to feel of their bodies. </p><p>Dick was breathing, but her husband’s </p><p>hands were cold and blood no longer flowed </p><p>from his crushed head. </p><p> As she knelt over them she heard the</p><p>swish of water behind her and saw the dark </p><p>shadow of a canoe against the brighter </p><p>river. As she watched, another and another </p><p>passed, stealthily, like ghosts, and she </p><p>knew that her people wfere retreating in </p><p>the darkness. She pushed out into the </p><p>stream and all night toiled with the others </p><p>against the current.</p><p> Dawn found their paddles still plying</p><p>steadily and they did not stop until they </p><p>were a league beyond a river flowing into </p><p>the Misisepe from the north, the route by </p><p>which the attackers had come. The entire </p><p>party, numbering only a pitiful dozen </p><p>canoes hid in a slough while three un- </p><p>wounded warriors in a single canoe went on </p><p>to warn the great body of their people, </p><p>who, they knew, would be camped at the </p><p>big falls of the great river. </p><p> Dick’s foster-mother, weary as she was,</p><p>did all she could do for the wounded man. </p><p>She removed the body of her husband and </p><p>made a soft bed for the Virginian in the </p><p>bottom of the canoe. She felt of the great </p><p>welt on the side of his head, pressed against </p><p>the skull and grunted with satisfaction </p><p>on finding that it had not been crushed. </p><p>She washed the blood from his head and </p><p>neck, bathed his face and crooned over him </p><p>in an effort to bring him to consciousness. </p><p> But the hours went by and the Vir-</p><p>ginian lay in the bottom of the canoe, his </p><p>face white, his eyes closed, his chest rising </p><p>and falling only slightly and with ominous </p><p>pauses between. </p><p> Later in the afternoon a boy stationed on</p><p>the bank of the main channel reported that </p><p>the warriors were passing and the fugitives </p><p>paddled out of their hiding-place to see a </p><p>hundred canoes, each driven by four men, </p><p>speeding down with the current to cut off </p><p>the Saulteurs and avenge the deaths of </p><p>their people. </p><p> Dick’s foe'.er-mother toiled the remainder</p><p>of the day to traverse the six leagues re- </p><p>maining before the main encampment of </p><p>her people was reached and then, exhausted, </p><p>she turned her patient over to others. </p><p> The morning of the second day Dick</p><p>opened his eyes for the first time. He </p><p>was too weak to move and he believed at </p><p>first that the thunder in his ears was due </p><p>to his injury, for in all his travels on the </p><p>Misisepe he had not found even a rapids. </p><p>He was lying in a bark cabine, alone, but </p><p>soon his foster-mother entered, to retreat </p><p>at once with loud shouts of joy that brought </p><p>a crowd to the door. Broth was poured </p><p>between his Ups, his face and head bathed,</p><p>and he dropped off to sleep. </p><p> The recovery of the Virginian was a</p><p>matter of weeks, not days. Willing hands </p><p>bore him each morning to the trees above </p><p>the great falls, which Frenchmen were to </p><p>see a few years later and name St. Anthony. </p><p>Women brought him food, the choicest </p><p>parts of the game. Old men came and sat </p><p>beside him, smoking for hours in absolute </p><p>silence if he showed no desire for con- </p><p>versation. </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>95 </p><p> The war-party returned with a score of</p><p> prisoners and long tales of vengeance.</p><p> The Saulteurs had been dispersed, some</p><p> fleeing into the forest, others down the</p><p> river, all cut off for the time from their own</p><p> country to the northeast.</p><p> Again Dick was amazed at the tolerance</p><p> of the Nadouaissioux. Ten prisoners were</p><p> executed as had been the Islinois. The</p><p> others, after witnessing the execution, were</p><p> set free and told to report to their people</p><p> that the Nadouaissioux had not sought war,</p><p> that they desired peace with the Saulteurs,</p><p> but that their neighbors were guilty of the</p><p> foulest treachery and would be exterminated</p><p> if ever again they committed such an act.</p><p> The methods of torture Dick had seen</p><p>to the eastward, and which he believed </p><p>were practised by all savages, were un- </p><p>known among the Nadouaissioux. It was </p><p>a custom to be adopted later, after the </p><p>effects of the Iroquois raids had been felt </p><p>in the valley of the Misisepe. </p><p> Yet the people with whdffi Dick found</p><p>himself called themselves Poualaks, or </p><p>“warriors,” the name Nadouaissioux, mean- </p><p>ing “a snake,” or “enemy,” having been </p><p>given them by the Saulteurs. The French </p><p>soon reduced this to Sioux, and the amiable, </p><p>brave, honest people who spread from the </p><p>Misisepe to the great mountains to the </p><p>west, those who spared their prisoners and </p><p>wept copiously at will, were the ancestors </p><p>of the followers of Sitting Bull. </p><p> Dick believed his recovery would be</p><p>short. Virginia was ever in his mind. </p><p>July had come but there was still time for </p><p>him to escape for his dash of several hun- </p><p>dred leagues down the great river. But a </p><p>week after he arrived at the falls he dis- </p><p>covered that his right side was partially </p><p>paralyzed. Sometimes he could move his </p><p>right arm or leg but he never could be </p><p>certain. A day might go by without his </p><p>being able to walk. </p><p> At first this brought a greater despond-</p><p> ency than at any time since the death of</p><p> Antoine Goddin. There was a chance</p><p> when he had been captured by the Islinois,</p><p> still a chance when he was bound to the</p><p> tree before the Nadouaissioux boys. Now</p><p> he saw none. A thousand leagues of</p><p> unknown wilderness lay between him and</p><p> his destination, a thousand leagues of</p><p> paddling, portaging, hunting his living,</p><p> dodging hostile savages, finding his way.</p><p> Not only a stout heart but a whole body</p><p> was necessary, and he could not even swing</p><p> a paddle, could not lift his musket to his</p><p> shoulder, could not be certain but that the</p><p> next step would topple him to the ground.</p><p> It was maddening, and for the first time</p><p>Dick refused, even after days of contempla- </p><p>tion, to accept his fate without bitterness. </p><p>Savages he could fight or outwit, strange </p><p>waters could be navigated, trackless forests </p><p>could be traversed, but this was something </p><p>wholly beyond his power to combat. Idle, </p><p>chafing, cursing each day that found him </p><p>still at the falls, he saw July pass. There </p><p>was no improvement. The blow on the </p><p>left side of his head had injured his brain </p><p>or certain nerve-centers, and he saw a life- </p><p>time of hobbling, crawling beggary among </p><p>savages who, as time passed, would lose their </p><p>awe for his color, would forget that he had </p><p>killed two of the Saulteurs in their disastrous </p><p>battle down the Misisepe. </p><p> The first of August nearly all the people</p><p>gathered at the great falls began to depart </p><p>for their Winter home among the in- </p><p>numerable lakes at the source of the Mis- </p><p>isepe. There, among the wild oats marshes, </p><p>secure from attack and provided with grain </p><p>and beaver and moose for the Winter, they </p><p>would remain until the following Spring. </p><p> There was nothing for Dick but to accom-</p><p>pany them. His foster-mother paddled </p><p>him, he hobbled or crawled across portages. </p><p>Warriors gave them of their game, were </p><p>glad of the honor of carrying his musket. </p><p>Some insinuated that Dick should teach </p><p>them its use and give them powder and </p><p>balls, but he had only a small amount of </p><p>ammunition and even in the face of this </p><p>last disaster he could not give up all hope </p><p>that some day he might recover and start </p><p>back to Virginia. </p><p> It was on this journey to the Winter</p><p>home of the Nadouaissioux that peace was </p><p>arranged with the Saulteurs. Dick had </p><p>heard of the power of the calumet, had seen </p><p>the reverence in which the Islinois held it,</p><p>had been told by Goddin of its might among </p><p>all the Western tribes. The Sioux espe- </p><p>cially kept all sworn promises with an </p><p>inviolable fidelity and the ceremony of the </p><p>calumet meant that absolute trust could be </p><p>placed upon them. </p><p> The calumet itself, originally a stick of</p><p>wood two or three feet long, a quarter of </p><p>an inch thick and two inches wide, pierced </p><p>from end to end so that the breath or spirit </p><p>might pass through it, had, in Dick’s time, </p><p>96 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>a bowl at one end in which to smoke the </p><p>sacred tobacco. The whole affair was </p><p>usually gorgeously decorated and many </p><p>of the tribes knew and practised a dance </p><p>and chant in honor of the calumet itself. </p><p> Since Dick had become a Nadouaissioux</p><p>and had gained the confidence of the older </p><p>men of the tribe, they often talked to him </p><p>of the calumet and its power. It could be </p><p>used in all things, as a passport to distant </p><p>tribes, to ratify peace pacts or treaties, </p><p>to secure good weather, to bring rain, to </p><p>attest contracts and to declare war. </p><p>BUT not until he witnessed the </p><p>treaty with the Saulteurs had he </p><p>realized the really impressive cere- </p><p>monies with which it could be smoked. </p><p>For this was its most important use. Dick </p><p>was accorded a seat in the front circle of </p><p>warriors and as he watched the chiefs of </p><p>the two nations gravely blowing the smoke </p><p>toward the sky, the four world quarters </p><p>and the earth, earnestly invoking the sun </p><p>and other spirits as witnesses to their </p><p>vows of “sacred kinship,” he could not but </p><p>be impressed by the sincerity of the par- </p><p>ticipants. </p><p> Through September the savages were</p><p>busy with the harvest of wild oats. Huge </p><p>quantities were gathered in the great </p><p>marshes and put away for Winter. The </p><p>women worked from morning to night, </p><p>driving their canoes through the tall stalks </p><p>and beating the kernels into the bottom </p><p>with short sticks. The wild oats marshes </p><p>were the property of the Sioux and even </p><p>then were becoming a bone of contention </p><p>with the Salteurs and starting a warfare </p><p>that was to last through nearly two cen- </p><p>turies. </p><p> With the first snows of Fall Dick dis-</p><p>covered that his paralysis was leaving him. </p><p>Daily he began to have more and more use </p><p>of his right arm and right leg. A fierce </p><p>exaltation seized him. Each morning he </p><p>tested his limbs, tried to walk, to lift </p><p>things. If he were able to get away before </p><p>the first ice in the lakes could reach the </p><p>swift current of the Misisepe, he could keep </p><p>ahead of Winter in its southward rush, </p><p>could at least reach the Ohio before frost</p><p>closed the waterways. That would be </p><p>half his journey and he would risk the </p><p>danger and privation of the rest. Before </p><p>Spring Virginia would have the news of his </p><p>discovery. </p><p> But he was too eager, pressed his recov-</p><p>ery too hard. His nerves ceased entirely </p><p>to function and, shivering, despondent, he </p><p>lay beside the fire in the birchbark cabine </p><p>as Winter gripped the Northern land. </p><p> It was then that Dick Jeffreys for the</p><p>first time thought of other things in Vir- </p><p>ginia than his mission and Governor Berke- </p><p>ley. With the savages there had been </p><p>constant human contact but never human </p><p>fellowship. The oil was stirred into the </p><p>water but never merged with it, never could </p><p>be absorbed. Ever since the death of </p><p>Antoine Goddin Dick had felt a void which </p><p>even his breathless impatience to return </p><p>to Virginia could not entirely fill. </p><p> Now, lying beside a small fire in a low,</p><p>evil-smelling cabine, shut in by the fierce </p><p>Winter of the North, despondent, comfort- </p><p>less, his mind turned to the people of Vir- </p><p>ginia. There was his father, alone like </p><p>himself, with even a deeper personal sorrow, </p><p>perhaps mortally wounded by what he </p><p>would consider as the complete disgrace </p><p>of his son. There was Elizabeth Carver, </p><p>Betsykins, the one person in the colony </p><p>who had been a real companion, who had </p><p>more nearly understood him, and she, like </p><p>his father, had been left with a great mis- </p><p>understanding, had in the end been de- </p><p>prived even of that wonderful faith in </p><p>him. </p><p> Dick sometimes marveled at this trust</p><p>of the girl, whom he still considered, as he </p><p>had that last night under the sycamores </p><p>as a romping, boyish, carefree comrade. </p><p>Even now he failed to understand how he </p><p>had hurt her in that last interview, still </p><p>believed it was his irreverence for kings </p><p>that had shocked her royalist ears. </p><p> In his foster-mother alone did Dick find</p><p>comfort. Like many Indian women who </p><p>have passed middle age, who have seen </p><p>Winters and famines and wars come and </p><p>go, leaving their trail of suffering and </p><p>sorrow and death, she was a strong, noble, </p><p>virile character. Though the Nadouais- </p><p>sioux did not accord their women a high</p><p>place, she had won to a certain influence </p><p>through the sheer dominance of her will, </p><p>her keen intellect and her biting tongue </p><p>which were, in fact, the only qualities of </p><p>leadership possessed even by the men. </p><p> Her sharp comments, her shrewd de-</p><p>ductions, her knowledge of savage nature, </p><p>expressed openly or in long conversations </p><p>with the leading men, had resulted in her </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>97 </p><p>wielding a power in the band that was not </p><p>second even tp the chief’s. The deaths </p><p>of her two sons and husband had brought </p><p>a certain bitterness, a vindictiveness that </p><p>had won advantageous terms in the treaty </p><p>with the Saulteurs, but it had also, in her </p><p>loneliness, brought a great affection for </p><p>the white man who had become her son. </p><p>On Dick she lavished her tenderness, that </p><p>mother love which is so often consuming </p><p>among savage people, and, in time, her </p><p>quick intuition and shrewd observation </p><p>led to a discovery of his ambitions and </p><p>hopes. </p><p> “Your body is here but your heart is</p><p>not,” she said to him one night as they sat </p><p>beside the fire. “Our people can become </p><p>the children of another nation when </p><p>adopted. But the white man can not </p><p>change his heart any more than he can </p><p>change his skin.” </p><p> Dick did not reply. He had a certain</p><p>fondness for the old woman, a great respect, </p><p>but he did not know that he could confide </p><p>in her. </p><p> “You can trust me,” she uncannily</p><p>answered his thought. “I am your mother, </p><p>and I know my son.” </p><p> Dick looked at the wrinkled, dark-</p><p>skinned face with the straight black hair </p><p>brushed back from a low forehead. In </p><p>the hard-pressed mouth, the thick nose </p><p>the expression that always was stern and </p><p>forbidding, he found nothing assuring. </p><p>But in the eyes, black, unwavering, he </p><p>found truth, the mother love, a real tender- </p><p>ness that belied the stern features. </p><p> “You are right, mother,” he answered</p><p>impulsively. “I am not happy here. I can </p><p>not be. You have been as kind to me as </p><p>your own flesh and blood. Your people </p><p>have been brothers. I should not ask more. </p><p> “But,” and his eyes glowed as he sat</p><p>up and faded her across the fire, “my </p><p>heart can never be here. It is in the place </p><p>where I was born, where I have always </p><p>lived, where my father, white-haired, sor- </p><p>rowing, waits for me. My land is far away </p><p>and I would have been there now had</p><p>not the Islinois falsely accused me and </p><p>taken me prisoner. I must go back to </p><p>my home, mother. I must go.” </p><p> The old woman studied him shrewdly for</p><p>a moment. </p><p> “There is a woman,” she said at last.</p><p>“You have not cared for the young women </p><p>of our people.” </p><p> “No, there is none,” answered Dick</p><p>earnestly. “It is because I love my land </p><p>and my people and because I can not be </p><p>happy away from them.” </p><p> For a long time she sat looking into the</p><p>fire. The flickering blaze enhanced the </p><p>savagery of her features. Her brown, </p><p>knotted, toil-cramped hands were clasped </p><p>about her knees. Her eyes stared, un- </p><p>wavering, unblinking, complete masks for </p><p>her thoughts. </p><p> “My son,” she said at last, "you have not</p><p>told me all. It is not a woman, for a </p><p>woman brings another light to a man’s </p><p>eyes. It is not the sickness of much </p><p>thinking, for the longing for home dulls </p><p>them. You have not told me all, and I do </p><p>not ask it. I am an old woman, one who </p><p>never before saw white men, and who am </p><p>I to understand them? White men harness </p><p>the thunder, cut and harden the iron, make </p><p>signs with black water that are the same </p><p>as words. Why, then, should they not </p><p>have thoughts that we can not know? </p><p> “But you are my son, even my flesh</p><p>and blood, and your happiness is my happi- </p><p>ness. I would rather see you laughing </p><p>with your own people than sorrowing with </p><p>mine. When the Spring comes you will </p><p>go.” </p><p> “Go!” cried Dick excitedly. “But I can</p><p>not lift a paddle.” </p><p> “You will be well and strong when the</p><p>snow has melted.” </p><p> “But the chiefs! Your people! The</p><p>calumet was sung and danced at my </p><p>adoption!” </p><p> “And the calumet shall take you safely</p><p>to your own people.” </p><p> “How do you mean?”</p><p> “Leave that to me, my son. I am old.</p><p>My life is spent. I will never again see </p><p>the harvest of the wild oats, never again </p><p>suffer through another Winter. My hus- </p><p>band is gone, my two strong sons. You </p><p>have been as a son to me, but why should </p><p>you remain here after I am gone?”. </p><p> “But they will follow, bring me back,</p><p>and the calumet has been smoked.” </p><p>“You smoked it to save your life. And </p><p>what is the calumet to a white man? He </p><p>has other vows, and you gave none of </p><p>them. Content yourself, my son. When </p><p>the ice is gone from the lakes your canoe </p><p>will be turned toward the south. In the </p><p>moon of the crane you will go, and, because </p><p>you shall bear the calumet, in the moon of </p><p>98 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the rut of the elk you will come to your </p><p>own people.” </p><p>CHAPTER XVI </p><p>VIRGINIA </p><p>NOT again through the long Winter did </p><p>the old woman refer to Dick’s return </p><p>to Virginia. Impatient, eager, he spoke </p><p>to her one evening. </p><p> “Does my son doubt my word?” she</p><p>asked sternly. </p><p> As he lay beside the fire, trying to deter-</p><p>mine whether she had spoken boastfully, </p><p>idly, or whether she was really able to effect </p><p>his escape from the Nadouaissioux, he dis- </p><p>covered that the first of her predictions </p><p>was coming true. Day by day he began </p><p>to regain the use of his arm and leg. By </p><p>Midwinter he could walk without assist- </p><p>ance and could carry his musket. His </p><p>strength returned and before Spring he </p><p>was hunting moose and beaver with the </p><p>men of the band. </p><p> In the Winter the Nadouaissioux scattered</p><p>through the Great Lake country. In </p><p>various places only a few leagues apart </p><p>small villages of a few families were estab- </p><p>lished. This gave to each an undisturbed </p><p>game district and in Summer made it </p><p>impossible for enemies to surprise the band. </p><p>Before the foe had exterminated one </p><p>settlement the word would be carried to </p><p>the many others. </p><p> Dick and his foster-mother had Wintered</p><p>on a small lake twenty leagues from the </p><p>southernmost village. They were off the </p><p>main stream of the Misisepe, separated </p><p>from it by many small lakes and portages, </p><p>and there were half a dozen villages on the </p><p>route. </p><p> When the moon of the carp was in the</p><p>last quarter and the snow had begun to </p><p>go the old Nadouaissioux woman suddenly </p><p>announced that she was about to make a </p><p>journey and that she wished Dick to go </p><p>with her. She had a small sledge upon </p><p>which she bound food, robes and a mys- </p><p>terious bundle which she had been guarding</p><p>carefully all through the Winter. Dick, </p><p>though he could get no hint as to the object </p><p>of her expedition, but hoping that it might </p><p>mean the fulfilment of her promise, was </p><p>eager to accompany her. Because she was </p><p>old he asked to be allowed to pull the </p><p>sledge, but she sternly informed him that </p><p> his duty was to go ahead and hunt, leaving</p><p>woman’s work to her. </p><p> Each night they stopped in one of the</p><p>small, marsh-bound villages. Here for </p><p>the first time since Dick had known her </p><p>she showed an interest in petty village </p><p>gossip. Her stories of their own intentions </p><p>and experiences both amused and disturbed </p><p>the Virginian, but so great was his con- </p><p>fidence in her he did not ask questions. </p><p>Back of it all he felt that there must be </p><p>some motive, some purpose. So he sat </p><p>silently beside the camp-fires while she </p><p>asked innumerable trivial questions and </p><p>inquired into every action through the </p><p>Winter of every one she met. </p><p> At the end of the week they passed the</p><p>last village. Still the old woman kept on </p><p>and they camped that night in the open. </p><p>But her garrulity had ceased as suddenly </p><p>as it began. Now she sat for long hours </p><p>beside the fire of dead pine, staring un- </p><p>blinkingly into the flames. She kept her </p><p>thoughts to herself, offered no explanation </p><p>to Dick of their mysterious journey. Each </p><p>night he fell asleep while she sat thus, and </p><p>each morning he wakened to find her there. </p><p>Apparently she never slept. </p><p> For another week she led him on into</p><p>the south, along the frozen bed of the </p><p>Misisepe, which was now only a small, </p><p>winding stream. Neither as they trudged </p><p>on through the day nor as they sat beside </p><p>the fire at night did she speak. As the </p><p>time passed she seemed to grow more </p><p>feeble, to become more weary after the </p><p>day’s toil. But always her eyes were </p><p>bright and steady and each night she </p><p>refused to.stop until darkness made further </p><p>progress on the rotting ice impossible. </p><p> The afternoon of the ninth day after</p><p>leaving the last village she turned toward </p><p>the shore and pushed the brush aside. </p><p> “It is here,” she said simply. “We can</p><p>rest until the river breaks its bonds.”</p><p>Dick, from his position behind her, </p><p>caught a glimpse of red birchbark behind </p><p>the bushes. </p><p> “A canoe!” he exclaimed.</p><p> “Did you think I wasted my breath in</p><p>all that foolish chatter in the villages?” </p><p>she asked sharply. “Did you think I aired </p><p>for gossip of all their silly doings?” </p><p> “And you asked thousands of ques-</p><p>tion to -” </p><p> “To learn one thing, that this canoe</p><p>was here behind these bushes. Now, my </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>99 </p><p>son, we have only to wait until the ice is </p><p>gone. It will be soon, for the moon of the </p><p>crane is new and I said that in the moon </p><p>of the crane you would start to find your </p><p>own people.” </p><p> Now that she had reached the canoe</p><p>before the rotting ice drove her to the </p><p>difficult, travel along the bank, the old </p><p>woman was more cheerful and communi- </p><p>cative. The first night, after a supper of </p><p>wild rice and moose meat, she brought out </p><p>the mysterious bundle and untied it. It </p><p>was long and thin and the outer wrapping </p><p>of tanned moosehide disclosed a hunting </p><p>shirt fringed and decorated with bands of </p><p>porcupine quills. Without a word she </p><p>handed it to Dick. </p><p> His astonished thanks were sincere</p><p>for he knew that the quill work had re- </p><p>quired every spare moment of the Winter, </p><p>but his eyes were fixed in what still re- </p><p>mained in his foster-mother’s hands. It </p><p>was the reason for the odd shape of the </p><p>bundle, a long, richly ornamented calumet. </p><p>Dick recognized it at once as the most </p><p>sacred possession of the Nadouaissioux, </p><p>the same pipe with which the treaty with </p><p>the Saulteurs had been affirmed. </p><p> His foster-mother was busy, however,</p><p>with another and smaller bundle. As she </p><p>unwrapped the skin Dick exclaimed in </p><p>amazement. She held half a dozen small </p><p>bells, the tongue of each bound with a </p><p>thong so that it would be noiseless. </p><p> “Where did you get them?” he demanded</p><p>as he looked at these unaccountable evi- </p><p>dences of trade with Europeans. </p><p> “Listen, my son,” she began. “This</p><p>calumet will bear you safely through the </p><p>lands of strange people. Only show it, </p><p>wave it toward the sun, smoke it with the </p><p>people you meet, and you may pass un- </p><p>harmed. Never was there a calumet so </p><p>powerful. The people of any nation who </p><p>see it will recognize it at once. </p><p> “The shirt you must wear always. Upon</p><p>it I have sewed quills of colors and in </p><p>forms and figures which denote my prayers </p><p>for your safety. These are as the words</p><p>the white man makes with the black water. </p><p>This,” and she pointed to a row of odd </p><p>figures, “will preserve you from storms. </p><p>This one will assure you fair weather. </p><p>This will keep you safe from the jaws of </p><p>wild beasts and the monsters you will meet </p><p>far down the ‘great water.’ This will </p><p>preserve you from the treachery of people </p><p>like the Islinois and others who have no </p><p>honor. I have spent the Winter working </p><p>these prayers upon your shirt that I might </p><p>know my son will be safe. </p><p> “The bells our people once received from</p><p>the Hurons when they came to trade </p><p>before we learned their black hearts and </p><p>drove them far to the east. A few Sum- </p><p>mers ago the Outaouas attacked our people </p><p>in the great marshes where we spent the </p><p>Winter. They became lost and our war- </p><p>riors surrounded them. They hid like the </p><p>ducks, with only their heads above water, </p><p>crawling in the wild oats and reeds. </p><p> “For a long time our warriors waited,</p><p>but they did not come out. We knew </p><p>they had not escaped for there were no </p><p>signs. At last the warriors found only one </p><p>piece of dry land where the Outaouas could </p><p>leave the marsh and across this, in the </p><p>grass and brush, they stretched a fish net </p><p>and to that they tied these bells, which </p><p>they had received in trade from the Hurons. </p><p>Then in the night the Outaouas crawled </p><p>like snakes through the marsh and in the </p><p>darkness thrust their heads against the net </p><p>and caused the bells to ring. Our warriors </p><p>came and slew a hundred of them, all except </p><p>one, who was sent back to his people with </p><p>the story of how we deal with those capable </p><p>of such treachery. </p><p> “These bells are a sacred possession of</p><p>our people but now they are yours. In </p><p>your long journey you must go alone, must </p><p>have time to sleep. Each night you are to </p><p>tie strings to the brush near where you </p><p>sleep and place these bells upon them. </p><p>Then you will be warned in time.” </p><p>DICK was overwhelmed by the </p><p>thoroughness of his foster-mother’s </p><p>preparations but in her every act </p><p>he saw only disaster for herself. </p><p> “I can not let you do this,” he cried.</p><p>“What will your people say when they</p><p>learn that the calumet and the bells are </p><p>gone? What will become of you when </p><p>they learn you have taken them, and to aid </p><p>me to escape?” </p><p> “Where are my son’s wits?” she replied</p><p>scornfully. “Do you think you could have </p><p>passed through all those villages alone, </p><p>could have reached the ‘great water,’ </p><p>without setting every one to talking, and </p><p>to thinking, without having a band of </p><p>warriors at your heels? Do you think </p><p>you could have passed on the ice without </p><p>100 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>it being known? And, if you had waited </p><p>for the ice to go, where would you have </p><p>found a canoe, and how could you have </p><p>carried one past the villages? My people </p><p>believe you are one of them but a little </p><p>thing would have given them strange </p><p>thoughts, and you would never have </p><p>reached the big falls. </p><p> “That was another reason for my talking.</p><p>I told them my dead husband’s spirit had </p><p>come to me in the Winter and told that </p><p>the beasts had destroyed his grave and left </p><p>him uncovered. They think I am going </p><p>to cover my dead anew and that you go to </p><p>help me.” </p><p> “But you! After taking these things,</p><p>after all that you have done, what will </p><p>your fate be when you return?” </p><p> “Your wits still hop about like the bugs</p><p>in the grass,” she answered. “I am not </p><p>going back.” </p><p> “But you—you—you don’t intend to go</p><p>with me?” </p><p> “I will go with you, my son, so far as</p><p>the prairie where my sons died. There I, </p><p>too, will die. I only hope that I will live </p><p>long enough to reach the spot.” </p><p> “But you are not ready to die. There</p><p>are still years of happiness for you.” </p><p> “There is never happiness for the old</p><p>women of my people. When we are old </p><p>and useless no one cares for us. Our chil- </p><p>dren have duties of their own,* the mouths </p><p>of their own children to feed, their own </p><p>families to protect from the enemy. There </p><p>is no happiness in the lives of the old. </p><p>Their thoughts are in the past. Their </p><p>fingers are stiff and can not sew garments. </p><p>Their legs are feeble and they can not </p><p>hunt enough to eat. Their arms are stiff </p><p>and they can not gather enough wood to </p><p>keep them warm through the Winter. </p><p>When one is too old to work one is too old </p><p>to live. Yonder is the last new moon </p><p>I shall ever see.” </p><p> While they waited for the ice to go Dick</p><p>tried to persuade her to return to her people</p><p>with the calumet and the bells, only to find </p><p>her purpose unshakable. Her husband </p><p>and her sons dead, her adopted son on the </p><p>way to his own people, life held nothing, </p><p>she declared, and she only feared that she </p><p>would not live long enough to reach the </p><p>grave of her sons. </p><p> Dick could not understand her assurance</p><p>that she could time her death so accurately. </p><p>She had marched long hours each day, </p><p>dragging the sledge. She seemed to be </p><p>strong and well. And yet when the ice </p><p>had rotted, the river had opened and at </p><p>last they had embarked on the long journey, </p><p>he saw that her paddle was ineffectual, </p><p>that she made only the motions. Before </p><p>they reached the great falls she was forced </p><p>to admit that she could no longer gather </p><p>the firewood and cook the meals. Only in </p><p>her eyes, black, blazing, unquenchable, did </p><p>life seem to remain. </p><p> Dick, now that he had started at last</p><p>for Virginia, now that he was on his way </p><p>with the message he bore, paddled steadily </p><p>through the long days. The river, swelling </p><p>hourly, bore him swiftly, but his paddle </p><p>shot the little canoe even faster. The great </p><p>falls were passed and the lake where the </p><p>Saulteurs had ambushed the Nadouaissioux. </p><p>Landmarks slipped by one after the other </p><p>and he knew that two or three more days </p><p>would see him at the mouth of the Ouis- </p><p>consin. </p><p> But as he watched the silent figure curled</p><p>in the bow he wondered if she would live </p><p>to see her desire fulfilled. For days she </p><p>had lain there in the bottom of the canoe, </p><p>motionless, uncomplaining, her wasted body </p><p>consumed bit by bit by the fire of her un- </p><p>conquerable will. As Dick’s fear that she </p><p>would die any hour became greater her </p><p>desire became his and he pressed on early </p><p>and late, driving his little craft with the </p><p>one purpose of reaching the bartering-place </p><p>in time. </p><p> It was mid-afternoon of a bright April</p><p>day when at last he turned into a channel </p><p>setting in toward the eastern bank and shot </p><p>down to the prairie above the mouth of the </p><p>Ouisconsin. It was deserted. The bare </p><p>poles of cabines scattered over the plain </p><p>seemed like ghosts of the thousands who</p><p>had thronged the place when he had last </p><p>seen it. </p><p> As he approached the bank he feared</p><p>that he might be too late. For hours he </p><p>had not seen a movement of the silent figure </p><p>in the bow. He stepped ashore and leaned </p><p>over her. </p><p> “We are here, my son,” she said as her</p><p>eyes opened. “You have your mother’s </p><p>thanks. Carry me up so that I can see </p><p>the prairie and I will die in sight of the place </p><p>where my sons lie.” </p><p> He lifted her from the canoe and carried</p><p>her to a knoll from which she could look </p><p>out over the plain to the bare bluffs beyond. </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>101 </p><p>For a few moments she sat there, only her </p><p>eyes moving. Then they closed and for </p><p>the second time, on the banks of the great, </p><p>unknown streams of the great, unknown </p><p>wilderness, Dick felt that he was alone. </p><p> As carefully as with the body of Antoine</p><p>Goddin, he prepared a final resting-place </p><p>for her after the white man’s fashion. He </p><p>dug deep in the soft earth and piled stones </p><p>upon the grave. Then with his ramrod </p><p>he burned an inscription in English upon a </p><p>hewn board. </p><p> Sorrowfully and slowly he paddled away,</p><p>caught the current and was swept down </p><p>and across to the bluff at the base of which </p><p>he had buried Antoine just a year before. </p><p>For an hour he sat beside the tomb he had </p><p>built, gazing out over the river, recalling </p><p>the last moments with his friend. </p><p> “Good-by, Antoine,” he said softly as</p><p>he arose. </p><p>IN HIS abstraction Dick paddled </p><p>until dark before he went ashore </p><p>on an island to camp for the night. </p><p>Day after day passed and he drifted down </p><p>the mighty river, which constantly grew </p><p>larger as streams flowed in from either side. </p><p>The towering bluffs at last gave way to </p><p>sweeping prairies. Game was abundant, </p><p>the weather delightful. Peace and con- </p><p>tentment seemed to hold the land, but </p><p>always Dick paddled, always he pressed on, </p><p>spurred anew by the thought of the two </p><p>graves he had left at the mouth of the </p><p>Ouisconsin. </p><p> Islands were numerous and afforded</p><p>comparatively safe camping-places. One </p><p>night, however, he tried the western shore </p><p>and in the morning wakened to find a group </p><p>of strange savages about him. Soberly he </p><p>filled and lighted the calumet, waved it to </p><p>the sun and the four quarters of the earth, </p><p>and then passed it to the strangers to smoke. </p><p> The magic of the pipe was more potent</p><p>than he had dreamed, annoyingly so, for </p><p>they insisted upon taking him to their </p><p>village and feasting him for three days </p><p>before he was escorted back to the river. </p><p>He found they were the Ottos, a branch of</p><p>the Ouinibegous, distant cousins of the </p><p>Nadouaissioux. There was no difficulty </p><p>in understanding their dialect, and from </p><p>them Dick learned that the wilderness, </p><p>now taking the form of great plains, ex- </p><p>tended for several leagues to the westward, </p><p>ending at the great mountains without a </p><p>sign of salt water. On the plains were </p><p>many and strange nations, and beyond the </p><p>mountains, it was reported, were still other </p><p>lands and other people. </p><p> The Ottos warned Dick that he would</p><p>find savage people and still more savage </p><p>monsters if he continued on the “great </p><p>water,” but he fired his musket to show </p><p>what he could do and departed with their </p><p>best wishes. </p><p> A large stream flowed in from the east</p><p>which he took to be the Rocky River. </p><p>Two noble streams joined the great water </p><p>from the west, and still the boundless </p><p>prairies continued. Sometimes the Mis- </p><p>isepe swung to the southeast or southwest, </p><p>but almost always he traveled south. </p><p> At last he came to the mouth of a river</p><p>on the east which he believed to be that </p><p>of the Islinois. Twice he had passed </p><p>villages of these people but had avoided </p><p>being seen except by a solitary hunter he </p><p>encountered on the shore. </p><p> Immediately after passing the mouth of</p><p>the Islinois Dick came to the influx of a </p><p>stream on the western side. It was a </p><p>turbulent, muddy giant of a river, rushing </p><p>into the beautiful, calm Misisepe, dis- </p><p>coloring its waters, causing great, swirling </p><p>eddies, taking possession of the valley and </p><p>dashing on, carrying the canoe more swiftly </p><p>than it had ever traveled before. Dick </p><p>recognized it immediately as the great </p><p>stream of which Western savages had </p><p>spoken as the bartering-place the year </p><p>before, the Pekitanoui, or “muddy river,” </p><p>afterward to be known, through another </p><p>savage language, as the Missouri. </p><p> In the mammoth river in which he now</p><p>found himself Dick began to watch eagerly, </p><p>at last anxiously, for the Ohio. From the </p><p>vegetation and the climate he judged that </p><p>he was as far south as Virginia, but still </p><p>he was traveling straight on. </p><p> His belief that the Ohio joined the</p><p>Misisepe was based on the rumor Basile </p><p>Pombert had heard from savages he had </p><p>seen and from his own knowledge of the </p><p>country. He had traveled straight north </p><p>from the Ohio nearly to Lac Mecheygan </p><p>on a large stream. The Islinois flowed from </p><p>nearly the same place and toward the </p><p>southwest. In the great triangle between </p><p>there would not be room for another river </p><p>so large as the Ohio, and he reasoned that </p><p>the first big tributary on the east must be </p><p>the one he sought. </p><p>102 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> When he was about to despair, beginning</p><p>to think of turning back, fearing his </p><p>geographical guesses had been far wrong, </p><p>he reached it and turned joyfully toward </p><p>the east.	&lt;•</p><p> Long days of toil followed. The river</p><p>was high, with a good current, and it </p><p>turned and twisted in a manner that </p><p>became increasingly exasperating. But </p><p>after a few days remembered landmarks </p><p>were passed and he went on with new </p><p>energy, assured that his course was right. </p><p>He spent almost every hour of the day </p><p>in the canoe, but as his supply of wild rice </p><p>gave out he was often forced ashore for </p><p>game. Once he pressed on regardless of </p><p>food but the consequent weakness con- </p><p>vinced him of the folly of such a course. </p><p> Twice the calumet won passage past</p><p>large villages of strange savages. Once </p><p>when he was cooking a meal on shore two </p><p>Indians crept close in a thicket and his life </p><p>was saved by the prayers embroidered on </p><p>his hunting-shirt. </p><p> But he knew that, once he had reached</p><p>the mountains at the head of the Ohio, </p><p>his calumet and quill-worked applications </p><p>to the spirits would be unavailing. Only </p><p>in the great valley of the Misisepe did the </p><p>pipe hold sway. Then his skill as a woods- </p><p>man and blind chance alone could win </p><p>through to the settlements on the eastern </p><p>side of the Blue Mountains. </p><p> And they won through. Near the head</p><p>of the Monongahela he abandoned the canoe </p><p>and struck into the wilderness. He avoided </p><p>valleys in which he knew the savages would </p><p>gather, kept on the high levels and slowly, </p><p>cautiously wormed his way past. </p><p> In his concentration on the one purpose</p><p>to reach Virginia Dick never forgot that he </p><p>was only fighting his way to certain death. </p><p>But not once since he had burned his in- </p><p>scription on the oak that towered above the </p><p>“great water” had this consideration even </p><p>made him falter. Scarcely, in fact, did </p><p>he even think that his achievement might </p><p>allay the hatred of Berkeley. If he had </p><p>thought of himself at all it was only that </p><p>his fate was insignificant in the face of his</p><p>duty. </p><p> This feeling increased with the strain of</p><p>constant watchfulness through the thou- </p><p>sand leagues of travel since he had left the </p><p>land of the Nadouaissioux and his greatest </p><p>fear was not of Berkeley but of failure </p><p>when the goal was almost in sight. As </p><p>the strain increased there resulted a nervous </p><p>condition that made sleep at night only a </p><p>fitful jumble of dreams. </p><p> Twice he had cause to be thankful for</p><p>the thoughtfulness of his foster-mother </p><p>when the bells, tied to strings in bushes </p><p>near his resting-place, warned him of the </p><p>presence of prowling savages. Each time </p><p>he risked the noise of firing his musket, </p><p>for he knew that the entire tribe would be </p><p>at his heels if he permitted the prowler to </p><p>escape. </p><p> Fifty leagues from Jamestown Dick</p><p>discovered the first evidence of an Indian </p><p>uprising. An isolated clearing, far up </p><p>toward the foothills, contained only the </p><p>blackened timbers of a cabin and the bones </p><p>of the settler’s family. He had realized </p><p>that in the colony of Virginia itself, where </p><p>long association with the whites had bred </p><p>an intense hatred, and where Governor </p><p>Berkeley’s fear for his fur trade had induced </p><p>a policy of no defense, would come his </p><p>greatest danger. </p><p> With this evidence of the savages’</p><p>hostility he could not tell whether it was </p><p>an isolated massacre or whether he would </p><p>find a string of ruined plantations across </p><p>the colony and the survivors besieged in </p><p>Jamestown itself. He kept to the thick </p><p>swamps, the most inaccessible places, </p><p>traveled only at night, spent most of his </p><p>days in watching. Once he found the trail </p><p>of what he believed to be a small war-party, </p><p>and again he saw a thick column of smoke </p><p>that undoubtedly rose from a burning </p><p>settler’s home. </p><p> Dick was greatly weakened by the strain,</p><p>sleeplessness and lack of food. Days and </p><p>nights spent in the dark, dismal swampland, </p><p>his body wet and shivering, finally had their </p><p>result. When only a few leagues from his </p><p>father’s plantation the fever caught him. </p><p> Still he forced himself to go on, barely</p><p>a league a day. He was almost too weak </p><p>to walk. Often delirium brought visions </p><p>of hatchet-swinging, yelling savages bend- </p><p>ing over him. One evening, after dragging </p><p>himself forward all day he came out upon </p><p>the bank of the James. Down the stream </p><p>a little way he saw the bow of a canoe </p><p>hidden in the grass. When darkness fell </p><p>he crawled into it, pushed out into the </p><p>current and drifted down. </p><p> Every inch of the land and water was</p><p>now familiar, even at night. In another </p><p>league he would reach the cleared fields of </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>103 </p><p>his father’s plantation. A league beyond </p><p>that he would see the manor house outlined </p><p>against the sky, if it were there, if the </p><p>savages had confined their operations to </p><p>the outskirts of the settlement. </p><p>A BEND in the river suddenly dis- </p><p>closed the lighted buildings. They </p><p>were safe. Jamestown was safe. </p><p>He worked the canoe painfully and slowly </p><p>across the current to a point where, he </p><p>knew, he would strike the wharf. In a few </p><p>minutes he was walking up the broad path. </p><p> The great hall door was open, the win-</p><p>dows lighted, but no one was to be seen. </p><p>He crossed the broad veranda, entered the </p><p>hall. The door of the dining-room opened </p><p>and an old negro woman stepped out. </p><p> “Marse Dick!” she shrieked, and turned</p><p>to flee. He caught her by the shoulder and </p><p>swung her back. </p><p> “Where is father?” he demanded.</p><p> “Is yo’ daid?” she demanded in terror.</p><p> “No,” he answered sharply. “Where is</p><p>father?” </p><p> “He’s done gone over to Marse Carver’s</p><p>fo’ de big dinner to his lawdship an’ de </p><p>gobernor, Marse Dick. Where yo’ been?” </p><p> “The governor! Governor Berkeley? Is</p><p>he there?” </p><p> “Yes, Gobernor Berkeley, an’ he’s at</p><p>Marse Carver’s, too.” </p><p> Dick swung around and walked out</p><p>through the door. He was deathly weak </p><p>but he had shaken the grip of the fever from </p><p>his brain sufficiently to realize that he could </p><p>hang on only a little longer. Before the </p><p>veil again descended, before what he </p><p>believed would be the end, he must find </p><p>the governor. </p><p> He stumbled down the steps and turned</p><p>to the old familiar path through the pines. </p><p>His feet seemed naturally to find their way, </p><p>making each turn, lifting themselves over </p><p>each root and stone. A quarter of a league</p><p>and he stood before Carver Manor, bril- </p><p>liantly lighted in every window. From </p><p>the open door came a burst of laughter. </p><p>Staggering, he crossed the lawn, mounted </p><p>the steps, entered the door. </p><p> A liveried servant barred his way. Dick</p><p>thrust him aside, muttering — “The gov- </p><p>ernor.” </p><p> The servant ran for assistance and Dick</p><p>walked down the hall to the door which, </p><p>he knew, opened into the dining-room. </p><p>It was closed. He lifted the latch, half-fell </p><p>as it swung open. He caught himself, </p><p>stood stiffly erect and his eyes swept the </p><p>brilliant scene before him. </p><p> The great table was bright with dozens</p><p>of candles in their golden sticks, with plate, </p><p>china and glassware. Around it were more </p><p>than a score of people, the cavalier aris- </p><p>tocracy of the colony, the women with </p><p>gorgeous gowns direct from Paris, the men </p><p>equally resplendent in silks and laces, vivid </p><p>colors and shining swords. </p><p> A woman glanced up at the door and</p><p>screamed. The chatter and the laughter </p><p>ceased. Men sprang to their feet, hands </p><p>instinctively falling to sword hilts. </p><p> Colonel Carver, at the head of the table</p><p>took a step forward, only to stare in amaze- </p><p>ment at the figure in the doorway. Before </p><p>him stood a tall man, thin, shaking with </p><p>the fever, his skin deathly white beneath a </p><p>scraggly beard, his buckskin garments caked </p><p>with mud, a rusty musket trailing at his </p><p>side, but with eyes that burned as bril- </p><p>liantly as a dozen candles and with a head </p><p>held high and proudly. </p><p> “Dick!”</p><p> Instantly all eyes turned from the</p><p>apparition in the doorway to the young </p><p>woman who had cried the name. She had </p><p>risen from the table and stood staring. </p><p>Her beautiful face had become as pale as his, </p><p>while in her eyes was both terror and disbelief. </p><p> “Dick!” she repeated unconsciously.</p><p>“Dick Jeffreys!” </p><p> Instantly the brilliancy of the staring eyes</p><p>was clouded. Dick’s proudly held head</p><p>was lowered and a great, overpowering </p><p>amazement impelled a step forward. </p><p> “Betsykins!” he whispered. “It is really</p><p>you, Betsykins?” </p><p> As their eyes met Dick forgot the fever,</p><p>the Misisepe, Berkeley, the noose, the </p><p>brilliant assemblage, everything except this </p><p>incomprehensible transformation from boy- </p><p>ish comrade to wondrous, alluring woman- </p><p>hood. In the half-delirium of fever his </p><p>mind instantly comprehended each act of his </p><p>pas- and its consequences in the future. </p><p>Heedlessly, prodigally, to satisfy vagrant, </p><p>trifling whims, he had dissipated man’s </p><p>greatest fortune. With startling clearness </p><p>he recognized what that last interview be- </p><p>neath the sycamores had meant to her, </p><p>how he had hurt her, what he had now </p><p>brought upon himself. </p><p> “Betsykins,” he repeated in a low voice,</p><p>one hand groping helplessly toward her. </p><p>m </p><p>104 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> In that moment Dick Jeffreys knew what</p><p>he desired more than anything else in the </p><p>world, that for which no sacrifice was too </p><p>great. It was not Betsykins, his playmate, </p><p>but Elizabeth, his mate, who stood there </p><p>before him. But as he looked at her he </p><p>saw the gulf between them. </p><p> The thought maddened him. What were</p><p>kings and empires and governors’ hatreds, </p><p>what were purpose and high resolve and </p><p>duty, before the demands of this over- </p><p>whelming love that he had always felt but </p><p>had never recognized? And yet he had </p><p>fought his way back to stare through the </p><p>noose at this glory that might have been. </p><p> Forgetting everything else, completely</p><p>crushed, the iron resistance that had kept </p><p>Dick on his feet for the last few days began </p><p>to desert him. His head fell forward. His </p><p>eyes half-closed. One hand groped for the </p><p>door-handle. The candles began to swing </p><p>about his head. </p><p> “Jeffreys, eh?” snarled a voice from the</p><p>table. </p><p> The hatred expressed in each syllable,</p><p>the gloating inflection on the question at </p><p>the end, stabbed through Dick’s wavering </p><p>consciousness, brought his head up with a </p><p>snap. An old man seated at the left of </p><p>Colonel Carver had risen to his feet and </p><p>as his eyes met Dick’s the young Vir- </p><p>ginian’s vision cleared instantly. </p><p> “The same, your Excellency,” he replied</p><p>steadily and clearly. “I am Richard </p><p>Jeffreys, and I have the honor to report </p><p>that I have been far beyond the Blue </p><p>Mountains, have reached the ‘great water’ </p><p>of which we have heard. I did not find </p><p>the Red Sea, the Gulf of California. It is a </p><p>thousand leagues from here. But I have </p><p>discovered a great river, greater than any </p><p>river in Europe, and a land as large as two </p><p>Europes, a land more fair, more fertile, </p><p>than man has ever known. I was the first </p><p>white man to see it, to traverse it, and I </p><p>claimed it in the name of the people of </p><p>England and their king, Charles the </p><p>Second.” </p><p>CHAPTER XVII</p><p>THE DISCOVERY </p><p>'G'OR a few moments after Dick had </p><p>finished speaking there was not a word, </p><p>not a movement, about the big dining-table. </p><p>Since the founding of the colony seventy </p><p>years before there had been continual </p><p>speculation as to what lay beyond the </p><p>Blue Mountains. From the Spaniards had </p><p>come amazing tales. They had traveled </p><p>far to the south and west, even to the </p><p>Eastern ocean. They had found gold and </p><p>pearls, rich nations, strange lands. </p><p> But of what lay to the north of the</p><p>Spanish country, of what lay west of </p><p>Virginia, behind the Blue Mountains, no </p><p>one knew. </p><p> Now this fever-stricken, wasted figure</p><p>had suddenly appeared before them and </p><p>had announced that not only had he been </p><p>farther than had any white man before him, </p><p>but also that he had taken this land of </p><p>mystery in the name of the king of England. </p><p> It was Sir William Berkeley’s eager voice</p><p>which first broke the silence. </p><p> “You found gold, precious stones, pearls,</p><p>for the king?” </p><p> “I found something more valuable than</p><p>gold,” answered Dick, “a land which holds </p><p>greater riches, and I found it for the people </p><p>of the king.” </p><p> “And you expect,” asked the governor</p><p>coldly, “that this will ransom your seditious </p><p>carcass, that this will save you from the </p><p>noose you slipped?” </p><p> “I expect nothing,” and Dick’s voice</p><p>rang out proudly. “I found a land far </p><p>more fair, far more fertile, far more vast, </p><p>than I have ever seen before. And I took </p><p>it in the name of the people and the king of </p><p>England. And because you are the king’s </p><p>representative in Virginia, I have come to </p><p>you to report.” </p><p> “And do you think the king will balance</p><p>that against your evil tongue?” demanded </p><p>his excellency in a rage. “What does the </p><p>king want of more wilderness? We can’t </p><p>keep the savages out of what we have here</p><p>in Virginia. What is land worth when it is </p><p>so far away? Had you brought gold, or </p><p>news of gold, the king might have listened </p><p>to you. There is gold there. The Span- </p><p>iards have found it. </p><p> “You have not been beyond the Blue</p><p>Mountains, sirrah. You have hidden with </p><p>the thieving, murdering savages in the foot- </p><p>hills and have come out with this wild tale </p><p>because you sickened of the life. Summon </p><p>a guard, Colonel Carver. This man goes to </p><p>the Jamestown .gaol.” </p><p> There was a gasp of amazement from the</p><p>diners. Dick’s manner of speaking, his </p><p>burning eyes, his simple words and his </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>105 </p><p>startling announcement had convinced </p><p>them all, had won for him the allegiance </p><p>of every one except Sir William. </p><p> “You hold the right to say the gaol, sir,”</p><p>answered Dick. “I expected nothing else </p><p>from you. Byt I found this land, I </p><p>traversed it for hundreds of leagues. It </p><p>is a year last April since I first saw the </p><p>Misisepe. Since then I have tried un- </p><p>ceasingly to return. I would have been </p><p>here a year ago had I not been twice </p><p>captured by strange savages. </p><p> “You may call this land worthless, but</p><p>the French think otherwise. They have </p><p>penetrated far, but none so far as I have </p><p>gone. Their king was about to send a </p><p>priest and a representative to find the </p><p>‘great water’ and take it in his name. </p><p>But I was first. A tree is blazed with the </p><p>announcement of my discovery. Scorn it </p><p>if you will, but the day will come when it </p><p>will be filled with the people of our race, </p><p>when there will be great plantations, towns </p><p>and cities, when there will be a thriving </p><p>commerce on its waterways. Scorn it and </p><p>let the French have it. The responsibility </p><p>will be yours.” </p><p> “To the gaol!” ordered Sir William in a</p><p>fury. “I will listen to no more of this! </p><p>I will not hear advice from an outlaw! </p><p>Take him away!” </p><p> There was a scream from Elizabeth</p><p>Carver and she dropped into her chair </p><p>and buried her face in arms outflung among </p><p>the china and glassware. Since she had </p><p>first seen Dick in the doorway, had called </p><p>his name, she had stood there looking at </p><p>him, hoping, praying that he had retrieved </p><p>himself. </p><p> As she sat there sobbing, an old man</p><p>farther down the table, his hair white, his </p><p>face deeply lined, staggered to his feet. </p><p> “Dick! Dick! My boy! My boy!” he</p><p>cried as he flung out an arm toward the </p><p>figure in the doorway. </p><p> “You forget yourself, Captain Jeffreys!”</p><p>snapped the governor. “Yonder stands a </p><p>fugitive, an outlaw, a defamer of his</p><p>Majesty. He is no son of yours.” </p><p> “He is my son!” answered the father</p><p>hotly. “And I am proud to say it, for he </p><p>stands there now, proving himself a </p><p>man.” </p><p> “To the gaol with him!” shouted Sir</p><p>William in a rage. </p><p> “I beg your Excellency’s pardon,” a cool,</p><p>low voice broke hi, and immediately there </p><p>was silence, while every eye was turned </p><p>toward the speaker. </p><p> He was a giant of a man, his great head</p><p>with its high forehead, wide-set eyes and </p><p>long black curls fittingly surmounting the </p><p>imposing bulk of him. Of all the men at </p><p>the table, he alone had not risen, had not </p><p>shared in the excitement caused by Dick’s </p><p>entrance and announcement. </p><p> Big as he was, there was nothing for-</p><p>midable in his appearance. Rather, in his </p><p>strong, gentle face, in an expression of </p><p>mental power that made one forget his </p><p>physical size, there was something that </p><p>instantly compelled confidence, and as he </p><p>spoke even Governor Berkeley turned </p><p>deferentially. </p><p> “There is nothing here in which you can</p><p>even interest yourself, my lord,” said Sir </p><p>William with a bow. “This young outlaw, </p><p>after defying the king and his laws, ran </p><p>away from the noose that he deserved and </p><p>now returns with this impossible story </p><p>with the expectation that it will save him </p><p>from the gallows. The only importance </p><p>of this incident to you and to his Majesty </p><p>will be the knowledge that we deal rigidly </p><p>with sedition in our colony.” </p><p> “I am sure, your Excellency,” the big</p><p>man replied calmly, “that his Majesty is </p><p>sufficiently assured of your zeal. It would </p><p>be more fitting the governor of so great a </p><p>colony if he employed his head a little more </p><p>than his heart.” </p><p>A GASP, followed by a low murmur, </p><p>broke from men and women alike, </p><p>and Sir William blushing furiously, </p><p>again bowed low but remained silent. </p><p> The big man turned in his chair so that</p><p>he faced Dick and for a moment he looked at </p><p>him curiously. </p><p> “A chair for Mister Jeffreys,” he ordered</p><p>without taking his eyes from the ragged </p><p>figure of the young Virginian. </p><p> “No, not there!” he said sharply as a</p><p>servant placed a chair behind Dick. “Here, </p><p>beside me! So. Now a glass of Colonel </p><p>Carver’s good Madeira. Quick, simpleton! </p><p>Can’t you see the man is ready to faint?” </p><p>Dick staggered across to the table and </p><p>dropped into the chair. </p><p> “Your lordship,” began Governor Berke-</p><p>ley. “I pray you! Do not let yourself be </p><p>contaminated by this fellow.” </p><p> Dick glanced up angrily at Sir William.</p><p> '“Perhaps,” he said, “his Excellency</p><p>io6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>would like to have me tell of our last in- </p><p>terview.” </p><p> It was a chance shot, for Dick did not</p><p>believe that, except for the two gaol </p><p>warders at the door, any one in the colony </p><p>would ever have a suspicion as to the </p><p>manner of his escape from Government </p><p>House. </p><p> “Your lordship,” the governor choked,</p><p>“there is only one place for this traitor, the </p><p>gaol, and tomorrow morning I promise you </p><p>he will swing from the gallows.” </p><p> “I don’t doubt it in the least, Berkeley,”</p><p>replied the big man calmly. “But it is not </p><p>serving the king well to use his power to </p><p>settle a personal grudge, and I have no </p><p>doubt but that you would snuff out the </p><p>chance for empire to save your dignity.” </p><p> Dick glanced at his lordship, marveling</p><p>at the shrewdness of the man in so quickly </p><p>divining the true situation between himself </p><p>and the governor. Sir William, pale with </p><p>-anger but silent, retreated to his chair. </p><p> “I might add,” continued the big man,</p><p>“that Mister Jeffreys has given tonight a </p><p>sample of the stuff of which empires are </p><p>made, a glimpse of the courage and per- </p><p>severance which is the boast of England, </p><p>and which gives his Majesty pride in the </p><p>worth of the people he had been granted the </p><p>right to rule.” </p><p> He turned to Dick, looked at him a</p><p>moment, and then, the rich lace of his cuff </p><p>falling upon the muddy, torn buckskin </p><p>leggings, laid a hand on the young man’s </p><p>knee. </p><p> “My boy,” he said, “I am Lord Cromp-</p><p>ton. I am just arrived from his Majesty’s </p><p>court, am his Majesty’s personal repre- </p><p>sentative sent to report upon conditions </p><p>in his colony of Virginia. Anything you </p><p>may say lo me will be faithfully reported </p><p>to his Majesty, and I assure you that his </p><p>Majesty is deeply interested in your story. </p><p>First, tell me where you have been, what </p><p>you have seen, and what you have done.” </p><p> Dick, revived as much by the kindliness</p><p>and understanding of his lordship as by </p><p>the glass of wine, recited briefly his experi- </p><p>ences since he had left Virginia thirty </p><p>months before. As he talked the very </p><p>thought of the wonderful country he had </p><p>found inspired him, and, when he had </p><p>finished, the diners, men and women, had </p><p>gathered around him and were listening </p><p>intently. </p><p> “Your Excellency,” said Lord Crompton</p><p>when 'Dick had finished, “had you been </p><p>acquainted with the ‘Relations’ of the </p><p>Jesuits as published in Paris, you would </p><p>recognize nothing except truth in what </p><p>Mister Jeffreys has said. Had you read </p><p>them you would marvel at the fortitude </p><p>of our young friend here, would stand in </p><p>awe of what he has accomplished. To me </p><p>it is an honor to know him, and I hope that </p><p>he will give me his friendship.” </p><p> He paused for a moment and looked at</p><p>Dick. </p><p> “My young friend,” he said at last, “I</p><p>wish I could be spared the words I must </p><p>speak now.” </p><p> The circle drew closer. Elizabeth Carver,</p><p>who had pressed near with the others, </p><p>stifled a cry. </p><p> “I know,” his lordship continued, “that,</p><p>as a brave man, you will receive bravely </p><p>what I have to say.” </p><p> He paused for a moment and then con-</p><p>tinued impressively: </p><p> “You are too late. The vast land you</p><p>have found has been lost to England, not </p><p>through your own failure, but through the </p><p>failure of the king’s representatives in the </p><p>colonies. Had there been others like you </p><p>we would have been the fathers of empire.” </p><p>“Lost!” cried Dick. “Too late! You </p><p>mean the Jesuit? Marquette?” </p><p> “Marquette, and Louis Joliet, emissary</p><p>of the king of France. I was in Paris the </p><p>first of the Summer. The city was aflame </p><p>with the news of what they had found. </p><p>The land has already been claimed by the </p><p>French. </p><p> “The date?” demanded Dick. “What</p><p>was the date?” </p><p> “They reached the Misisepe, of which</p><p>you have told, though Marquette called it </p><p>the Colbert, about the middle of June, last </p><p>year. They went down the river a great </p><p>distance, returned up another to what they </p><p>called Lac Mecheygan, and thence to </p><p>Montreal, where Joliet arrived in Novem- </p><p>ber. The news was immediately dispatched </p><p>to Paris.” </p><p> “Then we win!” shouted the young dis-</p><p>coverer. “We still win! The tree opposite </p><p>the mouth of the Ouisconsin stands there </p><p>now, blazed with the date, April 17, 1673. </p><p>That was two months before the French </p><p>arrived.” </p><p> “Even so,” said Lord Crompton, “the</p><p>French still win. I can not tell you or any </p><p>one here my reasons, but England is not in a </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>107 </p><p>position, at present, to dispute the claims of </p><p>France.” </p><p> “But it is not right!” protested Dick.</p><p>“It is not the land for the French. They </p><p>are fur-getters, not empire-builders. Every- </p><p>where they take from the land. Nowhere </p><p>do they put anything in it. You can see </p><p>for yourself. Look at the St. Lawrence, </p><p>where they have settlements. There it is </p><p>the fur, only the fur. Nothing is built for </p><p>the future. This land that I have discov- </p><p>ered is for our people, people who will care </p><p>for it as we have cared for Virginia, who will, </p><p>year by year, put in more than they take </p><p>out, who will build up for those who will </p><p>come after, not tear down.” </p><p>“You have a vision, my friend,” said Lord </p><p>Crompton, “but too far-sighted, too im- </p><p>patient. Some day, inevitably. Now, no.” </p><p>“Then what I have done, what I have </p><p>hoped for, is for nothing?” </p><p> “By no means. Brave deeds are never</p><p>for naught, nor such work as yours.” </p><p> But Dick did not hear. The disappoint-</p><p>ment, combined with the excitement and </p><p>the tension of the moment, snapped the </p><p>slender thread by which he clung to con- </p><p>sciousness. His body sagged in the chair, </p><p>his head fell forward, and he slipped to the </p><p>floor. Kind hands straightened out his </p><p>legs and arms, but his head rested among </p><p>the Parisian silks and laces of Elizabeth </p><p>Carver’s gown. </p><p> “Dick! Dick!” she cried. “Doctor!^ and</p><p>she looked wildly around until she saw the </p><p>physician pushing through the crowd. </p><p>“Tell me he won’t die!” </p><p> “Of course not, my child,” was the</p><p>answer. “It is only the swamp fever, the </p><p>fever piled upon the other load that bur- </p><p>dened him. But he is strong. First, we </p><p>must get him to bed. Colonel Carver?” </p><p> “I amlionored to have Captain Jeffrey’s son</p><p>in my house,” responded the colonel quickly. </p><p> Strong arms bore him up the stairs,</p><p>women crowded the door to be of service, </p><p>and only Governor Berkeley remained below</p><p>with Lord Crompton. </p><p> “Your Excellency,” said his lordship,</p><p>“may I not congratulate you upon the </p><p>estimable young men of your colony. I am </p><p>sure his Majesty will be delighted with my </p><p>relation of tonight’s affair.” </p><p> Sir William bowed low.</p><p> “I am always at his Majesty’s service,”</p><p>he murmured. “It is never my desire to </p><p>thwart his slightest wish.” </p><p> “I am sure of that Berkeley, and I am</p><p>sure that the king will have no cause to </p><p>disapprove of your actions in the future.” </p><p>DICK opened his eyes the next </p><p>morning to find himself in a bed </p><p>for the first time in two and a half </p><p>years. At first he believed he was alone. </p><p>Then he turned his head slightly and saw </p><p>his father sitting beside him. </p><p> “Better, Dick?” asked the old man</p><p>gently. </p><p> “I am strong enough to stand on Sir</p><p>William’s gallows,” was the reply. “That’s </p><p>about all I came back for, it seems.” </p><p>Instantly he realized that at the first </p><p>opportunity he had only driven his dagger </p><p>deeper into a torn heart. </p><p> “Forgive me, father!” he cried im-</p><p>pulsively as he reached for the hand that </p><p>lay on the coverlet. “It seems that I am </p><p>destined to wound you to the very end. </p><p>But I can’t help it. After seeing that land </p><p>to the west, after striving for a year and a </p><p>half to return with the news of my dis- </p><p>covery, there can’t be much else than </p><p>bitterness in finding the fate of our people </p><p>rests in hands like those of Berkeley.” </p><p>“There is nothing to forgive, my boy,” </p><p>answered the old cavalier gently. “In one </p><p>stroke you have wiped out whatever sorrow </p><p>your heedless youth may have brought to </p><p>me. And there need be no fear of Berkeley. </p><p>We are beginning to see what he is, what </p><p>his rule is doing for the colony. We are </p><p>all loyal subjects of his Majesty, but we </p><p>are citizens of the colony of Virginia, and </p><p>right must rule here as it does in England.” </p><p>“But the old devil’s claws are still un- </p><p>clipped!” protested Dick. </p><p> “They are pulled out by the roots so far</p><p>as you are concerned,” and Captain Jeffrey’s </p><p>face glowed with a pride of parenthood that </p><p>so long had been denied him. “Lord </p><p>Crompton rebuked the governor in the </p><p>presence of all the guests last night, un- </p><p>mistakably gave Sir William to understand </p><p>that he is to be held responsible to the king </p><p>for your safety.” </p><p> “He is the big man who talked to me.”</p><p>“The same, and a man with a heart and </p><p>a mind bigger than his great body. The </p><p>king turned over the colony to two of his </p><p>favorites, sold us out, and there has been </p><p>such a stir that his lordship was dispatched </p><p>to settle the matter. He is a favorite with </p><p>the king, but he is a man, and-” </p><p>io8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “He is a man!” interrupted Dick eagerly.</p><p>“And if such as he can put up with the folly </p><p>of kings in the hope that something good </p><p>will come out of it for all of us, I can do no </p><p>better than follow.” </p><p> “You will follow him, my boy,” and again</p><p>the father’s pride lighted up his face. “He </p><p>sails for England in two weeks and he told </p><p>me last night that you are to go with him, </p><p>are to tell his Majesty in person what you </p><p>have found. And then, Dick, you are to </p><p>come back, perhaps not to Virginia, but to </p><p>the colonies in this new world, for there is </p><p>much to be done beyond the Blue Moun- </p><p>tains, and you are to lead the work.” </p><p> “For a king!”</p><p> Dick’s old resentment flashed for a</p><p>moment. </p><p> “My boy, as we grow older we leam</p><p>many things,” answered his father soberly. </p><p>“I begin to think of a king, not as a divinely </p><p>empowered ruler of the people, but as— </p><p>well—as-” </p><p> “As a symbol of the Government only,”</p><p>Dick supplied. </p><p> “Exactly. I’d hang for this if it were</p><p>known, but it is so, my boy, and perhaps </p><p>you will live to see the time when kings </p><p>themselves are forced to admit it. But </p><p>you are weak, and there must not be more </p><p>strain. Sleep a while, Dick. In a few days </p><p>I will take you home.” </p><p> When Dick wakened again it was to find</p><p>a cool hand stroking his forehead. </p><p> “Elizabeth!” he cried in amazement as</p><p>he turned. </p><p> For a moment he drank in her beauty,</p><p>absorbing each detail of the whole that had </p><p>so staggered him the night before. The </p><p>brown, freckled skin of the romping child </p><p>had become clear, ivory-tinted with rose </p><p>petals. The straight, boyish figure had </p><p>rounded, swelling into the fulness of the </p><p>womanhood that had, to Dick, so miracu- </p><p>lously come to her. She blushed at the scru- </p><p>tiny but her eyes could not hide her happi- </p><p>ness. </p><p> “Elizabeth,” he whispered as he reached</p><p>for her hand. “Betsykins! What has hap- </p><p>pened to you? Oh, what a fool I have been! </p><p>My mad brain sent me off in search of </p><p>adventure and what I sought all the time </p><p>was here. Only now it is too late.” </p><p> “Too late! Lord Crompton humbled Sir</p><p>William before you last night.” </p><p> “Father has told me all that. But I was</p><p>not even thinking of Berkeley. It is you, </p><p>Betsykins. You are no longer the girl I last </p><p>saw under the sycamores by the river.” </p><p>“That was not yesterday, Dick.” </p><p> “Two years and a half!”</p><p> He turned his head away.</p><p> “Two years and a half to achieve failure,”</p><p>he whispered bitterly. </p><p> “Not failure, Dick,” answered the girl</p><p>quickly. “Did not your father tell you all </p><p>the plans?” </p><p> “Betsykins! You know what I mean,</p><p>what is more dear to me now than all else </p><p>in the world. Blind fool that I was. My </p><p>own boyish thoughtlessness lost it all for me. </p><p>But tell me*at least that you forgive and </p><p>forget that last night beneath the syca- </p><p>mores. Believe me that I did not know </p><p>what it was that I sought then.” </p><p> “Dick! Don’t! You must be quiet.”</p><p> “But answer me, Betsykins.”</p><p> “There is nothing to forgive or forget.</p><p>It is all in the past, wiped out by the fact </p><p>that you havq come back to me, back to </p><p>Virginia, you, the man I always knew you </p><p>would be and the man I love.” </p><p> She said it proudly, arrogantly, head held</p><p>high. But only for a moment, for Dick’s </p><p>arms drew her face down to his. </p><p> “What have I done to deserve all this?”</p><p>he asked humbly. “Antoine, my Nadouais- </p><p>sioux mother, and now you.” </p><p>Author of “In the Sawdust Country,” and “Afraid of the Bar.” </p><p>on the rude wall of the office, </p><p>the battered clock boomed off the </p><p>remaining seconds. At his desk </p><p>in the inner office, Potter sat </p><p>peering out through the window to the great </p><p>gray sawmill which stood, a buzzing hive </p><p>of activity, at the edge of the purple river. </p><p>Miss Carleton, in the outer office, drummed </p><p>a rapid tattoo with the end of a pencil on </p><p>the glass top of her desk. Behind her </p><p>Fenwick, the bookkeeper, was nervously </p><p>thumbing the pages of his ledger. </p><p> Miss Carleton glanced up at the clock.</p><p>There were four minutes left. Her eyes </p><p>turned to the inner office through which she </p><p>could see the man who, when the four min- </p><p>utes were gone, must rise to meet adventure </p><p>in no mean proportions. Four minutes, she </p><p>reflected; yet he sat gazing casually out </p><p>through the narrow window. </p><p> As Miss Carleton studied the motionless,</p><p>statue-like features of the man in the inner </p><p>office, an expression of deep admiration, </p><p>of fondness glimmered in her expressive </p><p>eyes. Behind her the clock continued to </p><p>toll off the seconds. The tattoo of her pen- </p><p>cil ceased abruptly. She rose and crossed </p><p>to where Fenwick stood before his tall desk. </p><p> “I think my nerves are about to snap,”</p><p>she whispered guardedly, so that the sound </p><p>would not carry to the inner office. She </p><p>nodded backward, in the direction of the </p><p>open door. “I wish I could be as cool as </p><p>he!” </p><p> Fenwick, middle-aged, lean, and pallid,</p><p>turned amused eyes upon her. </p><p> “Cool?” he returned in a nasal whisper.</p><p>“And why shouldn’t he be, I’d like to </p><p>know?” </p><p> Miss Carleton’s brows contracted.</p><p> “With Harrigan and his gang to face</p><p>tonight?” </p><p> Fenwick giggled with huge delight.</p><p> “Him face Harrigan? Why, he hasn’t</p><p>got the nerve!” </p><p> Miss Carleton’s eyes flashed in quick</p><p>loyalty.</p><p> “That’s not true!” she responded stoutly.</p><p>“When the report came in this morning that </p><p>Harrigan had raided our log rafts, Mr. </p><p>Potter said that tonight would end Harri- </p><p>gan’s career on Suicide River. Mr. Potter </p><p>is waiting for the shutting-down whistle </p><p>now.” </p><p> Fenwick nodded readily.</p><p> “Yes; he said that, but he had a long talk</p><p>no </p><p>Adventure </p><p>with Sheriff Dunn afterward. He’s not </p><p>going up-stream after Harrigan. He’s </p><p>sending the sheriff and his posse to do it for </p><p>him!” </p><p> Miss Carleton drew back with a quick</p><p>intake of breath. </p><p> “Why—why the sheriff and Harrigan</p><p>work hand in glove! The sheriff is on </p><p>Harrigan’s pay-roll.” </p><p> The bookkeeper drew the green eye-shade</p><p>from his forehead with an emphatic snap. </p><p> “Potter’s sending him because he hasn’t</p><p>got the nerve himself. He’s afraid to set- </p><p>tle his own scores. If he was half a man he’d </p><p>take a posse of the mill boys, and round up </p><p>Harrigan tonight. But instead he sends </p><p>Dunn!” </p><p> Miss Carleton’s sensitive lips quivered.</p><p>She cast an uncertain glance over her shoul- </p><p>der toward the open door of the inner office. </p><p> “You—you must be mistaken,” she said</p><p>indignantly. “Mr. Potter is—is a man! </p><p>He’d not go to Sheriff-” </p><p> She stopped. The whistle of the great</p><p>gray sawmill beyond the office shrilled its </p><p>six-o’clock bellow. The screech of the saws </p><p>died gradually to a low whine, then ceased </p><p>altogether. The planers relinquished their </p><p>chattering discourse. The cough of the </p><p>driving engine stopped. Silence crept over </p><p>the little sawdust community. </p><p> Miss Carleton turned about and swept</p><p>another glance at the open door. “I’m— </p><p>I’m sure you. are mistaken, Mr. Fenwick, </p><p>I know that Mr. Potter wouldn’t-” </p><p> A peremptory summons from the electric</p><p>buzzer above her desk interrupted. A mo- </p><p>ment later she stepped through the open </p><p>door and stood across the wide desk facing </p><p>Potter. </p><p> “I’m afraid, Miss Carleton,” he said,</p><p>gathering up the papers on the desk, “that </p><p>I’ll have to ask you to stay later tonight. </p><p>I’ll have a report or two to dictate a bit </p><p>later. And another thing, Miss Carleton,</p><p>when Sheriff Dunn arrives have him come </p><p>in immediately. Tonight he and his posse </p><p>are going up to the South Fork after </p><p>Harrigan.” </p><p>MISS CARLETON’S fingers tight- </p><p>ened spasmodically on the edge of </p><p>the wide desk. From outside the </p><p>office, came the loud tramping of many feet </p><p>as the mill crew passed on their way to the </p><p>mess-house. An instant later Fenwick </p><p>slammed the outer door. </p><p> “You’re—you’re not going up after</p><p>Harrigan yourself?” </p><p> Potter glanced quickly up from the papers</p><p>on the desk. </p><p> “The sheriff will attend to that. That’s</p><p>what the county pays him for, Miss </p><p>Carleton.” </p><p> Her tanned cheeks flushed deeply. On</p><p>the surface of the desk her finger-tips beat </p><p>an erratic tattoo. </p><p> “The sheriff is going to do it for you!”</p><p>Potter rose to his feet and stood facing </p><p>her across the desk. His gaze rested in- </p><p>terrogatively on her evident agitation. </p><p> “Surely the sheriff. That’s his job, Miss</p><p>Carleton.” </p><p> An expression of wistfulness and of dis-</p><p>appointment came upon her face. </p><p> “Then its true, you’re afraid!”</p><p> Potter smiled tolerantly.</p><p> “My dear Miss Carleton, you’ve excited</p><p>yourself over something.” </p><p> “I’m—I’m afraid you don’t understand,”</p><p>she murmured, hesitated for*a brief moment, </p><p>then swept.honestly on: “You’ve only been </p><p>in these woods a short while. But I was </p><p>bom and raised here, and the traditions </p><p>are—are part of me. Here in the sawdust </p><p>country a man fights his own battles. He </p><p>doesn’t ask outside help. And you’re </p><p>sending the sheriff to fight yours. We— </p><p>we call that cowardice!” </p><p> Potter’s leftn, youngish face bore honest</p><p>concern.</p><p> “But Miss Carleton I’m a busy man, and</p><p>have many things-” </p><p> Her Ups quivered.</p><p> “You’re—you’re afraid!”</p><p> “You do not understand,” he began, but</p><p>did not complete the thought. Miss Carle- </p><p>ton drew herself erfect in sudden dignity. </p><p>She halted the drumming of her fingers. </p><p>The abrupt cessation of their emphatic </p><p>tattoo was in itself an emphasis. </p><p> “Then all they say is true! You are</p><p>afraid and you make this an excuse. The </p><p>sheriff! Why—why he is as dishonest as </p><p>the man you are sending him after. He’s </p><p>in the employ of that very-•” </p><p> The street door opened and closed. Miss</p><p>Carleton turned about. In the outer office, </p><p>awkwardly twirling his hat* in his hands, </p><p>stood Sheriff Dunn. </p><p> She whirled quickly back to face Potter.</p><p>Tears of indignation glistened on her round- </p><p>ing cheeks. </p><p> “You’re afraid—a coward!” she sobbed</p><p>ST </p><p>Up-Stream </p><p>in </p><p>hysterically; and, brushing aside the tears, </p><p>she drew herself erect, and sped through the </p><p>open door to her desk in the outer office. </p><p> At Potter’s nod the sheriff entered and</p><p>took his position across the desk. Potter’s </p><p>face, a bit flushed, was as expressionless </p><p>as a piece of sculpture. </p><p> “Well, Dunn, are you ready? How many</p><p>men did you get?” </p><p> The sheriff shifted the weight of his body</p><p>to one foot, and cleared his throat apolo- </p><p>getically. </p><p> “I’m afraid I can’t do anything for you,</p><p>Mr. Potter. It would be a wild-goose </p><p>chase.” </p><p> Potter’s brows lowered.</p><p> “Can’t do anything? What do you mean,</p><p>Dunn?” </p><p> “Well, I’ve had the matter investigated</p><p>and come to the conclusion that your logs </p><p>wasn’t stole last night. The boom-sticks </p><p>must have parted and the logs drifted over </p><p>the bar to sea before daylight.” </p><p>“Investigated? Who investigated?” </p><p>“Jackson did this morning.” </p><p> “Jackson? Why, that man is-”</p><p> “He is my deputy-sheriff, Mr. Potter.”</p><p>“A deputy? Why, Dunn, every one </p><p>knows his connection with Harrigan.” </p><p>Dunn’s face flushed. </p><p> “You’re wrong, Mr. Potter. I advise you</p><p>to drop the matter. I don’t want to have </p><p>no trouble with you.” </p><p> “You don’t? By-, so that’s the way</p><p>the things stand. You don’t! So, all these </p><p>whisperings about you and Harrigan are </p><p>correct. You’re another of Harrigan’s </p><p>jackanapeses.” </p><p> The sheriff leaned across the desk.</p><p> “I warn you, Mr. Potter, them words-”</p><p> Potter rose to his feet. When he spoke</p><p>again his voice was low-pitched, and firm </p><p>with restraint. </p><p> “Get out of here quick, Dunn. I’ll get</p><p>my own posse to get Harrigan.” </p><p> Dunn wavered a moment; then stepped</p><p>to the door. </p><p> “As I said before, Mr. Potter, I advise you</p><p>to drop it. You can’t get no posse in this </p><p>town tonight. My deputy, Mr. Jackson, </p><p>just took the whole crew down to Danville </p><p>in his launch. He’s giving ’em a dance down </p><p>there. You may find one or two boys still </p><p>in town—but I advise you to forget it.” </p><p>The outer door slammed sharply behind </p><p>the sheriff. The boom of the battered clock </p><p>sounded again through the room. </p><p> Potter turned his gaze to the window.</p><p>Darkness was fast settling down over the </p><p>gray mill. He swung about and jerked open </p><p>a drawer in the desk. Taking up an auto- </p><p>matic, he dropped it into his pocket, </p><p>squirmed into a heavy red mackinaw, and </p><p>took up his hat. </p><p> “That will be all for tonight, Miss Carle-</p><p>ton. In the morning we will make the re- </p><p>port—if there is one to make.” </p><p> Through the broad front windows she</p><p>watched him go. Closing the door behind </p><p>him, he made off in the direction of the mill </p><p>wharf. He passed the bunk-house without </p><p>so much as a glance, and continued toward </p><p>the river’s edge. Miss Carleton sprang to </p><p>her feet. He was going without a posse. </p><p> “He’s going alone! No! No! They’ll kill</p><p>him! It’s—it’s my fault! I taunted him! </p><p>I said he was-” </p><p> She sprang toward the door; but half-</p><p>way, her knees ceased to support her body, </p><p>and a moment later the void unconscious- </p><p>ness descended upon her. </p><p>WHEN darkness had settled over </p><p>the surface of the river, Potter spun </p><p>the fly-wheel of the launch motor, </p><p>and a moment later, at low speed, piloted </p><p>the light craft from among the piling of the </p><p>mill wharf, out upon the breast of the moon- </p><p>lit river. </p><p> A heavy tide was running, which,together</p><p>with the natural current of the river, forced </p><p>him to increase the speed of the motor in </p><p>order to make way against it. For a time </p><p>he held steadily toward the open water; </p><p>then, as the middle of the river was reached, </p><p>he threw over the tiller, and the launch’s </p><p>nose swung about and headed up-stream. </p><p> It was fully five minutes before the craft</p><p>gathered full speed against the force of the </p><p>rushing waters. The dim shore-line on </p><p>either side of him swept by like a moving </p><p>picture. Overhead, the stars twinkled </p><p>faintly, dimmed by the light haze which </p><p>hung over the river. A vague wraith of </p><p>a moon stuck its thin, spindle points into </p><p>the gray sky. </p><p> He did not underestimate the difficulties</p><p>of the task before him. He was acquainted </p><p>with Harrigan and with Harrigan’s methods. </p><p>This river pirate was one of the most daring </p><p>characters in all the sawdust land. Ruth- </p><p>less, treacherous, resourceful, he was sur- </p><p>rounded by a crew of his own choosing. </p><p>Potter’s eyes glittered with anticipation, </p><p>112 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and he advanced the throttle of the </p><p>motor.	^</p><p> As he rounded a big bend in the river, a</p><p>brisk breeze drove down upon him from the </p><p>deep mouth of the river valley beyond. </p><p>Settling himself at the tiller, he rolled and </p><p>lighted a cigaret, and busied himself not- </p><p>ing the landmarks as they swept by. </p><p> As the launch breasted the mouth of the</p><p>South Fork, Potter threw over the tiller </p><p>again and ran the craft into the narrow </p><p>tributary. Here it was far darker than on </p><p>the main arm of water, the trees on either </p><p>bank mingling their foliage to shut out the </p><p>dim moon and stars. </p><p> At a quarter of a mile from the mouth of</p><p>the fork, Potter reduced the launch’s </p><p>speed, and directed the craft in among the </p><p>heavy undergrowth of the right bank. </p><p>Then he sprang ashore, making fast to the </p><p>heavy bough of a fallen forest giant. </p><p> He scrambled quickly up the bank, and</p><p>reaching the flat above, paused a moment </p><p>to take his bearings. Then, without hesi- </p><p>tation, he pushed ahead in the general di- </p><p>rection of Harrigan’s camp. </p><p> The slight mist of the early evening was</p><p>disappearing, and the sky and stars seemed </p><p>to have grown inestimably closer to earth. </p><p>He was grateful for this meager light; the </p><p>way underfoot was heavily overgrown and </p><p>cluttered with dead brush and the limbs and </p><p>trunks of fallen trees. </p><p> He halted suddenly, clutching the auto-</p><p>matic in his pocket until the edges of steel </p><p>stung the flesh of his hand. A dark shadow </p><p>moved ahead of him, and without hesita- </p><p>tion, he dropped flat on the ground. Crouch- </p><p>ing low, he watched the dim figure walking </p><p>back and forth across the moonlit trail. </p><p> Flat as possible on the ground, Potter</p><p>crawled at right angles to his original di- </p><p>rection, guarded by this shadowy figure, </p><p>which, he knew, must be one of Harrigan’s </p><p>pickets. It was slow, tedious work; the </p><p>twigs and branches which covered the </p><p>ground were dry and brittle, making great </p><p>the chances of discovery.</p><p> After perhaps ten minutes he reached a</p><p>wooded spot, and rose gratefully to his feet. </p><p>He had not been detected. The sentry </p><p>still warmed himself by treading back and </p><p>forth across the mouth of the trail. </p><p> Smiling to himself, Potter turned about</p><p>and started by the roundabout passage in </p><p>the direction of Harrigan’s rendezvous. </p><p>This way, although longer and more dif- </p><p>ficult to traverse, presented far less chances </p><p>of discovery. </p><p> He made his way slowly and cautiously.</p><p>Once or twice the darkness confused him, </p><p>and he was forced to strike a match in order </p><p>to take up the dim trail. The flare of the </p><p>match he carefully concealed within his </p><p>cupped hands, exposing the light in but one </p><p>direction at a time. </p><p> At perhaps half a mile from the spot at</p><p>which he had taken the wooded trail, Potter </p><p>discovered at some distance a dim glow. </p><p>In these deserted woods it could have but </p><p>one meaning. He knew that it was from </p><p>Harrigan’s fire; and when he went ahead </p><p>again, it was with decreased speed and in- </p><p>creased caution. </p><p> At every yard the glow increased, and</p><p>when the flames became visible between the </p><p>tree trunks, Potter chose his footings with </p><p>wearying exactness. He reached the edge </p><p>of the clearing without sound, and concealed </p><p>himself behind a huge fir. </p><p> A small fire blazed in the center of the</p><p>cleared space. At a short distance stood a </p><p>large pail of drinking water, and many rolls </p><p>of blankets. About the fire, sprawled in </p><p>various poses of relaxation were half a dozen </p><p>woodsmen, some dozing, some conversing </p><p>guardedly in whispers. </p><p> Closer to the fire, carefully apart from the</p><p>others, sat two men in close consultation. </p><p>One of them held up a sheet of paper to the </p><p>firelight. Unlike the others, they did not </p><p>whisper, and their conversation reached </p><p>Potter’s straining ears. </p><p> The smaller of these, Potter recognized</p><p>as Harrigan. He was a wizened little man </p><p>of perhaps forty years, sinewy of build, cat- </p><p>like of movement, and bronzed to the color</p><p>of old copper by the river suns. He was </p><p>reading to the other the figures from the </p><p>sheet of paper. The listener, a larger man, </p><p>was quite unknown to Potter. </p><p> The stranger took the paper from Har-</p><p>rigan’s hand and holding it up to the light </p><p>of the fire, scanned the figures it bore. </p><p> “That scale was made of the logs today,”</p><p>Harrigan was saying. “Look her over and </p><p>make us an offer. You needn’t be afraid </p><p>of trouble with Potter. He’s got no nerve. </p><p>We’ll attend to the brands on the logs, and </p><p>also to gettin’ them down to your customer’s </p><p>booms. So let your figure be big enough to </p><p>cover such incidentals.” </p><p> The stranger busied himself with a study</p><p>of the sheet. </p><p>Up-Stream </p><p>113 </p><p> “A fine flock of logs,” Harrigan pursued</p><p>conversationally, and apparently without </p><p>intention of helping out the sale. Indeed, </p><p>he seemed utterly indifferent as to whether </p><p>or not the other purchased his plunder. </p><p>“You’ll find them mostly clears, Benson. </p><p>Potter was bringing them down to his mill </p><p>to fill a big order for uppers.” </p><p> Potter’s sense of the dramatic told him</p><p>that his moment to make an effective en- </p><p>trance had come. Despite his iron control, </p><p>his breath caught once with an eager gasp. </p><p>His hand on the automatic inside the mack- </p><p>inaw pocket, he stepped briskly into the </p><p>circle of firelight. </p><p> “Yes,” he said evenly, grinning to the</p><p>startled Harrigan, “and Potter’s going to </p><p>take ’em down to fill that order!” </p><p> Panic took the place of the camp’s drowsy</p><p>calm. Every one sprang to his feet. So </p><p>startling had been Potter’s appearance that, </p><p>as he approached, the men involuntarily </p><p>retreated to the opposite side of the fire. </p><p>Across the low flame they glared at him </p><p>from frowning, startled eyes. </p><p> Doubtless the more imaginative of these</p><p>hardened woodsmen had thought, at the </p><p>moment of his appearance, that a forest </p><p>ghost was come to pay them a visit. Potter </p><p>gave little heed to them, however, concen- </p><p>trating his attention upon the quick, tiger- </p><p>like movements of Harrigan, whose small, </p><p>bead-like eyes were fixed on the bulge of </p><p>Potter’s pocket, where the muzzle of the </p><p>automatic was pressed. </p><p> “In all fairness I must warn you, Harri-</p><p>gan,” Potter remarked at the first sign of </p><p>activity on the little man’s part, “that I’m </p><p>not alone. There is a man with a gun be- </p><p>hind ever tree about this clearing. This </p><p>community has stood for your raids as long </p><p>as possible. I’m in dead earnest, Harrigan, </p><p>and you’ll be obliging yourself more than </p><p>me by just taking things easy.” </p><p> Harrigan, a sudden surprise dawning in</p><p>his eyes, turned a quick, nervous glance </p><p>about the dark rim of firs which surrounded </p><p>them. For a moment he seemed to cower </p><p>before their dark, sinister silence; but pres-</p><p>ently his eyes became defiant again, and </p><p>he turned back to Potter. </p><p> “What is it you want, Potter?” he asked</p><p>easily. </p><p> Potter laughed with genuine amuse-</p><p>ment. </p><p> “Isn’t that question rather unnecessary?”</p><p>he returned. </p><p>8 </p><p> Harrigan stared blankly across the smold-</p><p>ering fire. </p><p> “Possibly,” Potter continued, “you can</p><p>get away with that on the sheriff; but I </p><p>think we understand each other, Harrigan.” </p><p> The little man shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>The others, sullen and silent, grouped </p><p>themselves about their leader. </p><p> “What is it you want, Potter?” Harrigan</p><p>repeated mechanically. </p><p> Potter glanced amusedly about from one</p><p>to another. </p><p> “With so many rare birds, the selection</p><p>is rather difficult. But I guess you’ll do, </p><p>Harrigan. I want you.” </p><p> The little man grinned.</p><p> “Just me?”</p><p> “You and that sheet of paper,” Potter</p><p>returned good-humoredly. “The combina- </p><p>tion is beautiful. It cinches you nicely. </p><p>Even your man, the sheriff, can not ask for </p><p>more evidence.” </p><p> Harrigan’s eyebrows raised.</p><p> “The sheriff? My man? I’m not ac-</p><p>quainted with the gentleman, Potter.” </p><p> “Nevertheless, I imagine he is well ac-</p><p>quainted with your money.” </p><p> Harrigan grinned and dropped into his</p><p>pocket the sheet of paper which bore the </p><p>scale of the stolen logs. </p><p> “So!” he murmured after a moment’s</p><p>pause. “So! You want me, eh?” He </p><p>glanced keenly into Potter’s face. </p><p> “Exactly,” Potter nodded.</p><p> For a moment Harrigan’s eyes dropped to</p><p>the ground at Potter’s feet. Suddenly he </p><p>glanced up, his eyes cold as steel, his full- </p><p>lipped mouth mocking. </p><p> “Well, what are you going to do about it,</p><p>Potter?” </p><p> “I’d really not advise you to start any-</p><p>thing, Harrigan,” he said smiling. “How- </p><p>ever, that is your own lookout. I’ve given </p><p>orders to my men to pick you off first—at </p><p>the first movement.” </p><p> Harrigan nodded indifferently. Potter</p><p>paused a moment, baffled by the man’s self- </p><p>assurance. He wondered if Harrigan were </p><p>as certain as he seemed that he held the high </p><p>hand in the situation. </p><p> “You’ve raided my booms three times,</p><p>Harrigan,” he went on finally. “On each </p><p>occasion you half-killed the man who was </p><p>employed as watchman. The man you </p><p>got last night is right now fighting for </p><p>his life at the camp hospital. And his </p><p>chances are slim. He is a pal of the boys </p><p>ii4 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>I’ve brought with me. They’ll not hesitate </p><p>to pick you off.” </p><p>HARRIGAN grinned. His right </p><p>hand slid along his belt toward the </p><p>butt of a revolver which obtruded </p><p>from a large canvas holster. Of the group </p><p>across the fire, he was the only one visibly </p><p>armed. The others kept their hands at </p><p>their sides. But their eyes were full of the </p><p>activities of their chief. </p><p> Harrigan’s hand continued along the</p><p>belt and came to a stop on the butt of the </p><p>revolver. </p><p> “They tell me you used to be a cowboy,”</p><p>Potter laughed. “Think you can draw fast </p><p>enough for those boys out there?” </p><p> Harrigan grinned back good-naturedly.</p><p>In another moment his beady eyes nar- </p><p>rowed menacingly. </p><p> “Now Potter, you’ve had your little say,</p><p>and finished. It’s my turn. Here’s mine, </p><p>Potter!” </p><p> Without removing the revolver from its</p><p>holster, he fired twice, downward into the </p><p>ground. </p><p> “Now, Mr. Potter, you’d better go ahead</p><p>and take what you want. But you’ll have </p><p>to be quick. In less than a minute there </p><p>will be enough of my men around this </p><p>camp to pick the bones of you and your </p><p>gang. It’s your say, Potter. Now come!” </p><p> A vast doubt rose in Potter then as to the</p><p>success of his carefully planned ruse. He </p><p>removed the automatic from his pocket, </p><p>and directed it frankly across the fire. </p><p> “Don’t move,” he snapped, and retreating</p><p>a single step, stood beside the large pail of </p><p>drinking water, considering this new phase </p><p>of his adventure. Although not one of </p><p>them moved, a general grin spread over the </p><p>faces of the group he held at bay. </p><p> Harrigan was grinning mockingly across</p><p>at him. A moment passed; then another. </p><p> A loud tramping of underbrush sounded,</p><p>steadily growing nearer. A moment later </p><p>six men, panting breathlessly, burst into the </p><p>clearing. </p><p> “What’s the signal for, Boss?” the fore-</p><p>most of them asked as he caught his breath. </p><p> Potter laughed outright, and with the</p><p>muzzle of the automatic motioned them </p><p>across the fire. </p><p> “Over there with the rest!” he ordered.</p><p>He turned quickly and called back over his </p><p>shoulder to his fantom reenforcements— </p><p> “Watch ’em close, boys!”</p><p> A vague, concealed smile sparkled in his</p><p>eyes at this new turn of affairs. He swung </p><p>back to face Harrigan. </p><p> “You come with me quietly, Harrigan.</p><p>I’ve had enough of your bluffing, now I </p><p>mean business. You’re the only one I </p><p>want just now. My boys will stand guard </p><p>over this fine crew of yours until I’ve got </p><p>you [safely away. If one of ’em moves </p><p>so much as a hair my men out there won’t </p><p>spare him.” </p><p> Harrigan, his face purple with rage,</p><p>turned viciously on the men who had come </p><p>in answer to his signal. </p><p> “You fools—you fools! Why didn’t you</p><p>stay outside the clearing? They’ve got us </p><p>surrounded and—and you walk right in </p><p>too!” </p><p> An expression of vast astonishment, which</p><p>quickly changed to sheepishness, spread </p><p>over the faces of the newcomers. </p><p> Potter laughed heartily. He motioned</p><p>to Harrigan with the automatic. </p><p> “Well, Harrigan, come along. No time</p><p>to-” _ </p><p> He hesitated abruptly. A moment later</p><p>he swung his gaze to the dark rim of firs </p><p>which circled the clearing. A sudden alert- </p><p>ness was evidenced by the carriage of his </p><p>head. </p><p> The new sound drew every eye. Two</p><p>minutes passed. A seventh man stepped </p><p>into the light of the clearing.</p><p> Harrigan, his eyes bulging, strangled his</p><p>rage with effort. </p><p> “My God! You too!”</p><p> The other grinned appreciatively.</p><p> “Wait a minute, Boss. Don’t heat your</p><p>collar. I just overheard what you said </p><p>to these guys and I had a look-around. </p><p>There ain’t a soul in these woods but what’s </p><p>right here!” </p><p> Harrigan’s wizened face was a study of</p><p>transformation from one violent emotion </p><p>to its direct opposite. A vast delight </p><p>kindled in his eyes. He turned upon Potter </p><p>with a roar. </p><p> “A stall! Well,I’ll be crucified! Potter,</p><p>you’re good!” </p><p> The hard lines of the little man’s face eased</p><p>to a great laugh. As his laughter ended, </p><p>his eyes became beady and small again, </p><p>and his mouth twitched at the corners. </p><p> “Well, Potter!” he snapped, defiantly ad-</p><p>vancing a step. “Why don’t you take </p><p>what you want?” </p><p> He advanced still another step.</p><p>Up-Stream </p><p>11.5 </p><p> “I call your little bluff, Potter. Now</p><p>come!” </p><p> Potter came.</p><p> Stooping, he caught up the pail of drink-</p><p>ing water which stood close by, and dashed </p><p>its contents over the neglected fire. With </p><p>a hiss and a puff of steam, the flames were </p><p>blotted out. The sudden extinguishing of </p><p>the glare which had been in their eyes mo- </p><p>mentarily blinded the group. In this </p><p>moment of darkness, deepened by the over- </p><p>hanging foliage which shut out almost com- </p><p>pletely the dim light of the stars, Potter </p><p>sprang forward. </p><p> His spring carried him straight to Harri-</p><p>gan, who was now several paces in advance </p><p>of his men. With the butt of his automatic, </p><p>he rapped the little man gently but with </p><p>deft accuracy, on the head; and as the other </p><p>slumped into a limp heap, and before the </p><p>rest had regained their wits, picked up the </p><p>light burden and carried it swiftly toward </p><p>the wall of dark firs which surrounded them. </p><p> Gaining the seclusion of the forest, he</p><p>secured a fresh hold on the limp form of </p><p>Harrigan and swung him across his shoulder </p><p>like a slain deer. Then he started swiftly </p><p>down the wooded trail toward the river. </p><p>Behind him he heard the thud of bodies as </p><p>the others scrambled about in the darkness </p><p>searching for him. </p><p> Hoarse cries arose; orders were bawled by</p><p>some lieutenant of the man on his shoulder. </p><p>A rush of footsteps came along the trail. </p><p>Other and dimmer sounds came from the op- </p><p>posite direction, where, Potter surmised, </p><p>half of the crew were following the other </p><p>trail. </p><p> Stepping behind a large fir trunk, he slid</p><p>his burden to ,the ground, and propped it </p><p>against the tree. He secured the hands </p><p>and feet with leather thongs from his pocket, </p><p>and placed a gag, fashioned from his hand- </p><p>kerchief, over the mouth. </p><p> All about him now arose the calls and</p><p>curses of the men beating about in search </p><p>of him. With studied caution Potter stole </p><p>from tree to tree, the limp form of Harrigan</p><p>drooping over his shoulder. And when </p><p>the chase had passed far beyond him, he re- </p><p>turned to the trail, and thereafter his pas- </p><p>sage to the fork of the river was surer and </p><p>swifter. </p><p> Half-way, Harrigan regained full con-</p><p>sciousness. Potter set him down and tight- </p><p>ened the thongs and the mouth gag. On his </p><p>shoulder again, the little man squirmed </p><p>viciously; but Potter merely put a turning </p><p>pressure on the thong-bound wrists, and the </p><p>struggling was given over to sullen sub- </p><p>mission. </p><p> Down the perilously steep bank he carried</p><p>his captive and dumped him unceremoni- </p><p>ously into the bottom of the launch. Then </p><p>he whirled the fly-wheel, cast off the light </p><p>painter from the bough, and sped down the </p><p>narrow arm of water toward the open river. </p><p>As the nose of the launch swung on to the </p><p>river’s breast, the first dim rays of the im- </p><p>pending dawn appeared in the east, far </p><p>above the tips of the towering firs. </p><p> Sitting in the stern sheets, Potter rolled a</p><p>cigaret, and when it was alight, settled him- </p><p>self comfortably by the tiller, and guided </p><p>the craft in the direction of the mill wharf </p><p>in the town below. </p><p> As he sped down-stream, his mind crept</p><p>back over the events of the night; and when </p><p>he remembered that a certain girl—just the </p><p>sort of girl he had dreamed about back </p><p>in those college days of his, in far-away </p><p>San Francisco—had called him afraid, he </p><p>laughed softly, confidently, contentedly. </p><p>IN the little back room of the mill </p><p>office, Potter sat guard over his </p><p>prisoner. Harrigan, the thongs at </p><p>his wrists and ankles loosened and the gag </p><p>removed, lay sleeping fitfully in the bunk. </p><p>In his shirt sleeves, puffing at his pipe, </p><p>Potter sat close by. </p><p> He was roused suddenly from his revery</p><p>by the sound of light, rapid footsteps ap- </p><p>proaching along the board-walk which ran </p><p>in front of the office building. When the </p><p>footsteps halted, a key was fitted into the </p><p>lock of the office-door, and some one entered. </p><p> A faint, nervous tapping sounded on the</p><p>door of the back room. Potter rose and</p><p>tightened the thongs of his prisoner. A light </p><p>hand tried the knob of the door, and finding </p><p>it locked, the owner of the hand retreated </p><p>across the office floor. </p><p> Potter slipped quickly into his mackinaw,</p><p>unlocked the door, and stepped into the </p><p>presence of Miss Carleton. She stood </p><p>poised uncertainly in the center of the room. </p><p> Her eyes grew wide with relief as she saw</p><p>him. She ran quickly to him. </p><p> “Oh, I’m glad—glad, you didn’t go!”</p><p> She was swaying wearily there before</p><p>him and he put his arm about her slim </p><p>shoulder to steady her. </p><p> “I haven’t been able to sleep all night,”</p><p>n6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>she murmured weak!}'. “I’ve just paced </p><p>back and forth the floor of my room, until— </p><p>until I know every inch of the carpet!” </p><p> A light sobbing interrupted. She glanced</p><p>up at him then from between damp, un- </p><p>steady lashes. </p><p> “I was afraid you were hurt by what I said</p><p>last night. I was very much afraid you </p><p>had gone up-stream after Harrigan, and </p><p>they’d killed you, Mr. Jim. Oh, I’m glad </p><p>you didn’t go!” </p><p> Potter smiled reassuringly.</p><p> “Perhaps, Miss Carleton, what you said</p><p>is true.” </p><p> She shook her head vehemently.</p><p>“No, no! They would have killed you </p><p>surely! It would have been so utterly fool- </p><p>hardy. You’re not a coward, Mr. Jim!” </p><p>Potter’s arm tightened on her shoulder. </p><p> “I am very much a coward, Helene,” he</p><p>said softly. “There are many things I’d </p><p>like to say to you now, but I’m not brave </p><p> enough. And there is another thing I’m</p><p> quite afraid of. I wonder if you would</p><p> summon the sheriff for me?”</p><p> Miss Carleton’s eyes were startled.</p><p> “The sheriff?”</p><p> “I believe the sum total of the sheriff’s</p><p> objections to going after Harrigan last night</p><p> was lack of evidence. I’ve got some for him.”</p><p> Miss Carleton’s breath caught.</p><p> “You mean that you went up-stream—</p><p> up-stream alone?”</p><p>He nodded toward the back room. </p><p>Helene Carleton turned frightened eyes </p><p>toward the open door. </p><p> “You will get the sheriff for me, Helene?</p><p> I’m afraid to go for him myself.”</p><p> She drew herself back from him with</p><p> indignation.</p><p> “Afraid!” she echoed.</p><p> “You see, I’ve got Harrigan, himself, in</p><p> there,” Potter chuckled. “And I’m very</p><p> much afraid, Helene, to leave liim alone.”</p><p>THE BABU AND THE BLACK BUCK. </p><p> BY LOUIS ESSON</p><p> T WAS at a wayside station in North-</p><p> ern India.</p><p> The station-master, an officious and</p><p> voluble Bengali, was in a state of great</p><p> excitement. Lady Bertram had arrived.</p><p> She was the aristocratic wife of the great</p><p> Lord Reginald Bertram, a high magistrate</p><p> noted for his love of sport.</p><p> She presented a telegram. The babu</p><p> salaamed.</p><p> “I have it safe, my lady. It was left at</p><p> this station in my charge to be delivered</p><p> on inquiry. The cartage is thirty-eight</p><p> rupees.”</p><p> “Impossible!” replied the lady. “I won’t</p><p> pay thirty-eight rupees.”</p><p> “It is a corpse,” replied the babu</p><p> gravely, “and corpses are very expensive</p><p> indeed, I assure you.”</p><p> “Where is it?” she asked at last.</p><p> Impressed by his own importance the</p><p> Bengali opened an inner door.</p><p> “The corpse!” he said proudly.</p><p> Lady Bertram sniffed and retired.</p><p> “I refuse to take delivery,” she cried, and</p><p>then walked away haughtily to her carriage, </p><p>with her nose in the air. </p><p> I called the station-master.</p><p> “What have you got there?”</p><p> “It’s Lord Bertram’s corpse,” he said.</p><p>“Great Scott! And Lady Bertram has </p><p>refused to accept delivery of it!” </p><p> What was this tragedy, this Oriental</p><p>mystery? I went into the office, but soon </p><p>came out again. A huge black buck was </p><p>lying there, a wonderful beast, but in </p><p>rather high condition. So this was Lord </p><p>Bertram’s corpse! It seems the noble lord </p><p>had gone hunting, shot the animal in the </p><p>forest, and sent it along as a present to Lady </p><p>Bertram; but the train was slow, the </p><p>weather was hot, and the native official </p><p>had confused various regulations. </p><p> “Well,” I asked him, “what are you going</p><p>to do about it?” </p><p> The babu again looked up the regula-</p><p>tions. The case was perfectly clear. </p><p> “It shall be kept,” he replied, “for three</p><p>months, and then fonvarded to Delhi to be </p><p>sold by public auction.” </p><p>Author of “A Leader of Men,” “The Other Side,” etc. </p><p>IN THE- </p><p>DUG-OUT </p><p>W.Townend </p><p>A COMPLETE </p><p>NOVELETTE, </p><p>#^f^ENYON was a brave man. On </p><p>® &amp;j that point there were no two </p><p>•opinions in the battalion. And </p><p>«8£ jm the more terrible and hideous </p><p>his surroundings, the hotter the fight in </p><p>which he found himself, the more resolute </p><p>and clear-thinking he became. His men </p><p>regarded him with a kind of awe, an awe </p><p>not unmixed with a certain grim amuse- </p><p>ment, and since he showed no particular </p><p>desire to preserve his own life, yet never </p><p>asked that they should take risks that </p><p>were not wanted, they followed him </p><p>doggedly. They bore him no real love, </p><p>however; he was too cold, too unapproach- </p><p>able; but he exacted respect by reason </p><p>of his qualities in action, his courage, his </p><p>dash, and his leadership. </p><p> To Kenyon himself failure in anything</p><p>he had ever undertaken was inconceivable. </p><p>Pride alone would have made him a success </p><p>in war. For it was pride in his own destiny </p><p>that carried him triumphantly through </p><p>fights which others, more prudent, would </p><p>have avoided. It was pride in his own </p><p>powers, and nothing else, that kept him </p><p>going long after another man would have </p><p>given in. It was pride of race that forced </p><p>him to become a soldier when all his </p><p>instincts craved for peace. </p><p> His company sergeant-major, no mean</p><p>judge of character, summed him up more </p><p>or less accurately. </p><p> “A foine orficer, the foinest ever I seen</p><p>in all France. But faith—the army don’t </p><p>come nach’ral to him at all, at all. He’s </p><p>no more likin’ for the trinches or for going </p><p>over the top than the rist of us. He’s- </p><p>proud, all the same: so proud he’d be dyin’ </p><p>for shame’s sake rather than give any wan </p><p>cause to think that he hated the war. But </p><p>I know it’s thrue. I’m afther watchin’ </p><p>him many a time when he never knew I</p><p>was by. You could see in his eyes what </p><p>117 </p><p>ii8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>he was thinkin’ of deep in his heart. I’m </p><p>not blamin’ him, aythur. ’Tis a-of a </p><p>war, this, an’ well we know it.” </p><p> As a civilian Kenyon had been entirely</p><p>wrapped up in his work which was litera- </p><p>ture and his hobby which was old china. </p><p>He was a dreamer with high ideals and </p><p>expensive tastes. Vast wealth inherited </p><p>from an uncle had freed him from all </p><p>necessity of earning a living, hence he had </p><p>been able to devote his time and talents </p><p>to writing. </p><p> He had published two books on social</p><p>evolution and economics, three slim calf- </p><p>bound volumes of verse and a history of old </p><p>English chinaware, all of which were </p><p>highly praised by the press and neglected </p><p>by the reading and book-buying public. </p><p> Although thirty-five years of age when war</p><p>broke out Kenyon regarded it as his duty </p><p>to join the army and so aid his fellow-country </p><p>men in their task of defeating the Germans. </p><p> He announced his intention one morning</p><p>after breakfast. </p><p> His wife, younger than her husband by</p><p>some ten years, listened to his patriotic </p><p>outburst in somewhat troubled silence. </p><p> “Well!” he said and waited the approval</p><p>which he knew must, as usual, follow. </p><p> “There are many men younger than you,”</p><p>was all the comment she made. </p><p> “And am I to stand back,” he flared,</p><p>“until every man younger than myself, </p><p>every shirker in the kingdom, makes up his </p><p>mind? Am I not fit and strong? Any one </p><p>would think I were an old man!” Wounded </p><p>by the composure with which she had </p><p>greeted his momentous decision he gave </p><p>her once more the benefit of his views. </p><p>“It is my duty to join. That should be </p><p>quite sufficient. What is a man’s duty to </p><p>his country but to fight when needed? </p><p>Do I owe less of that duty than my neigh- </p><p>bor who has lived for six fewer years than </p><p>myself? Am I to let others pay my debts?</p><p>My God, Doris, I can’t do it.” </p><p> “But, Alan, how do you know you’ll ever</p><p>make a soldier?” </p><p> She spoke timidly, knowing full well the</p><p>effect of any opposition to her husband’s </p><p>wishes. </p><p> “Not make a soldier!”</p><p> He gazed at her with an expression of</p><p>offended dignity. Had she, his wife, alfer </p><p>three years of association with him, so small </p><p>an opinion of his intelligence? Did she </p><p>doubt his courage? </p><p> “Why not?” he said. “Surely Doris I’m</p><p>as brave as most men!” </p><p> The pain, genuine pain, in his voice cut</p><p>her to the quick. </p><p> “Dear, I didn’t mean that. I knowyou’ll</p><p>be brave of course. I was thinking of </p><p>your—your temperament.” </p><p> After that she did not speak for some</p><p>time. Did he realize—he was dense in </p><p>many ways, was Alan—did he realize what </p><p>his departure would mean to her? She </p><p>wondered. He would go away, out of her </p><p>life; light-heartedly, she knew; perhaps </p><p>never to return. Had he no duty to her? </p><p>To his wife! </p><p> “You haven’t considered my point of</p><p>view, Alan, have you? You’re a married </p><p>man. There are others who are not </p><p>married who have not yet joined.” </p><p> A stubborn look had come into his thin,</p><p>rather ascetic face. His lips were pressed </p><p>tightly together while she was speaking. </p><p> “Doris,” he said, “it’s the same for both</p><p>of us. You ought to be glad you have a </p><p>husband to send to the army. It is your </p><p>duty to let me go. Thank Heaven, I can </p><p>leave you provided for. It can’t be for </p><p>long. We’re bound to smash them.” </p><p>“With a small army such as we’ve got!” </p><p>said the wife. </p><p> “Wait till the men who are joining up</p><p>now reinforce them,” said the husband </p><p>grandly. “I don’t want to fight, God </p><p>knows, but it’s my duty! I think I can</p><p>give a good account of myself. I know I </p><p>can. Courage is merely a question of in- </p><p>telligent application of a rule. To lead </p><p>men in battle demands duty, honor and, </p><p>above all, pride.” </p><p> He met her gaze, challenging a denial.</p><p>She said nothing. Words were useless </p><p>now, she knew. She understood only too </p><p>well his meaning. Pride! What else was </p><p>it but pride that was taking him from her? </p><p>For pride’s sake he would cut himself adrift. </p><p>Pride would force him to do what others </p><p>had done or die in the attempt. Pride set </p><p>the standard by which he ruled his actions. </p><p> “What one man can do I can,” he said.</p><p>He patted her on the shoulder. “Be brave, </p><p>old girl. You must. You’re going to be a </p><p>soldier’s wife. And I won’t disgrace you. </p><p>You’ll be proud of me, I know.” </p><p> He was certain that what he said would</p><p>come true. He would give her good cause </p><p>for pride. The intoxication of war that </p><p>comes to those who have never seen war, </p><p>In the Dug-Out </p><p>119 </p><p>the spirit of the Crusader, was uppermost </p><p>in his consciousness. That his wife had </p><p>tears in her eyes was a vexation, but she </p><p>was a woman and to a woman tears were </p><p>natural. Nevertheless he hated scenes. </p><p>Any display of emotion was undignified. </p><p> “There, there,” he said. “You mustn’t</p><p>fret, sweetheart. It’s part of the sacri- </p><p>fice-” </p><p> He stared blindly out of the open window</p><p>at the meadows and woods and distant hills </p><p>bathed in mellow sunshine and saw himself </p><p>an officer at the head of his men fighting </p><p>against odds, doing gallant deeds, winning </p><p>fame and admiration. </p><p> A wonderful, brilliantly colored picture!</p><p> Doris would be proud of him. Even if</p><p>he were to fall in battle, it would be fine. </p><p> And so Kenyon was prepared for death</p><p>from the moment he set foot on the cobbles </p><p>of Le Havre. Moreover, from his point of </p><p>view it were more fitting to die bravely in </p><p>the open than save his life by hiding in some </p><p>trench or dug-out. Death, in other words, </p><p>before dishonor. He lived up to the ideal </p><p>he had in mind and gained much credit. </p><p> And then, during the Somme push, after</p><p>more than fourteen months of fighting— </p><p> EVERY man, however brave, has</p><p>r * some especial form of weakness. </p><p> Kenyon’s weakness, as revealed in</p><p>a front-line trench one Summer evening, </p><p>was peculiar but unimportant. Strangely </p><p>enough, however, it did far more toward </p><p>earning him the liking of his men than </p><p>had all his courage. His weakness showed </p><p>that he was, after all, human. </p><p> Kenyon was thorough in whatever he</p><p>undertook. So having become a soldier </p><p>through a sense of duty, and knowing the </p><p>inevitable risks of his calling, he must needs </p><p>prove his sincerity by displaying an almost </p><p>reckless contempt for danger. </p><p> It was this quixotic folly that led him</p><p>to make his way by himself through an</p><p>enemy barrage to some men of another </p><p>company cut off in a captured trench. </p><p> “You’ll never do it,” he was told. “It’s</p><p>madness to try.” </p><p> Kenyon laughed and ran forward through</p><p>the shells that burst on every side of him </p><p>with great spurts of flame and dense </p><p>columns of black smoke and earth and </p><p>stones flung skyward. </p><p> Those whom he had left behind wailed</p><p>to see him fall but the impossible happens </p><p>in war and Kenyon reached his men, </p><p>organized an effective defense, beat off an </p><p>attack and led the survivors back when it </p><p>became dark. </p><p> The colonel thanked him.</p><p> “I don’t know, Kenyon, when I’ve seen</p><p>a braver or more dashing deed. I’ll draw </p><p>the brigadier’s attention to what you’ve </p><p>done and tell him what I think you deserve.” </p><p>Kenyon was pleased, but he shook his </p><p>head. </p><p> “That was nothing, sir: absolutely noth-</p><p>ing at all. I can assure you that any one </p><p>else would have done the same as I did. I </p><p>was lucky enough to be given the oppor- </p><p>tunity, that’s all.” </p><p> This was no pose. Kenyon believed</p><p>what he said, having as high a faith in his </p><p>brother-officers as he had in himself. </p><p> It was on the evening after this exploit</p><p>that he revealed to an interested gathering </p><p>his own weakness. </p><p> He stood in a firebay talking to the</p><p>battalion bombing officer, O’Hara by name, </p><p>a mere boy in years but a veteran in expe- </p><p>rience and in a measure Kenyon’s model. </p><p> O’Hara had by his own deeds set a stand-</p><p>ard of courage that was high: that he him- </p><p>self would reach that standard had been </p><p>from the very first Kenyon’s aim. And to </p><p>O’Hara indeed, to his decision and cool- </p><p>ness, he owed his life, for O’Hara had gone </p><p>out into No Man’s Land under machine </p><p>gun fire and rescued him from the German </p><p>wire where he lay helpless. </p><p> “Got over your excitement of yesterday?”</p><p>asked O’Hara. “Pretty hot shop, that—eh?” </p><p>Kenyon smiled. </p><p>“Oh, yes! Pretty hot while it lasted.” </p><p>“Best thing I ever saw,” continued </p><p>O’Hara. “I dunno’ how on earth you got </p><p>through, Kenyon. By Jove, I wouldn’t </p><p>have tried it, myself, for a fortune.” </p><p> No man in' his heart of hearts dislikes</p><p>praise. </p><p>The color mounted into Kenyon’s cheeks. </p><p>“You say that, of course, but you’ve </p><p>done things every bit as good—better. I </p><p>wouldn’t be here now but for you, O’Hara, </p><p>and you know it.” </p><p> O’Hara laughed and looked at Kenyon</p><p>with his head on one side as though con- </p><p>sidering him in a fresh light. </p><p> “Lord, that was nothing.”</p><p> “Wasn’t it?” said Kenyon. “I know it</p><p>was. I’d given up all hope of ever getting </p><p>away, anyhow.” </p><p>120 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Rot!” said O’Hara. “It was pitch</p><p>dark and I knew pretty well whereabouts </p><p>you were. All I had to do was to find you, </p><p>cut the wire where you were caught and </p><p>help you in.” </p><p> Kenyon nodded slowly.</p><p> “Yes, quite so, but there’s more than</p><p>one way of telling the story. Don’t forget </p><p>that you carried me in. I couldn’t walk </p><p>for about a week afterward. I might be </p><p>hanging on that wire now.” </p><p> “Rot!” said O’Hara once more. “You’re</p><p>such a queer old beggar, Kenyon. You’ll </p><p>talk by the hour of what other fellows do </p><p>but when any one tries to point out that </p><p>you’ve done about a hundred times as much </p><p>as the rest of us put together you get quite </p><p>upset by it.” </p><p> There came a sudden shout from the other</p><p>end of the firebay. </p><p> “Luk at that, will ye! Take that, ye</p><p>brute!” </p><p> Kenyon turned sharply to see a rat-hunt</p><p>in progress. </p><p> Rats, those few that had crossed his path</p><p>in peace time, had always sickened him, </p><p>but the trench-rats, scavengers bred by war, </p><p>as foul as the jackals or vultures of warmer </p><p>climes, filled him with loathing. </p><p> Their size, their savage daring, their</p><p>cunning, their contempt for man, marked </p><p>them as vermin to be avoided: yet how </p><p>could one avoid creatures that swarmed </p><p>in trench and dug-out, that, more familiar </p><p>than the dogs of the house of Dives, stole </p><p>the food from the very table, that crawled </p><p>over one in the brief hours of sleep, that </p><p>were met with—most horrible of all war’s </p><p>horrors—in No Man’s Land among the </p><p>poor dead that lay month after month </p><p>awaiting burial. </p><p> To Kenyon the rats were a torment</p><p>harder to endure than shell-fire or bullets; </p><p>yet a rat-hunt with its almost inevitable </p><p>killing made him nervous. </p><p> So now he shivered, forced a smile, and,</p><p>ignoring O’Hara, moved away, hoping to </p><p>be out of hearing before the brute met its </p><p>death. </p><p> O’Grady, a lance-corporal in his company,</p><p>aimed a blow with the butt of his rifle as </p><p>the rat fled along the fire-step. The blow </p><p>missed and the animal, twisting around </p><p>raced back. </p><p> “Kill it, Sullivan!” shouted O’Grady.</p><p> “Out of the way, Terence! Mind yer-</p><p>selfl” </p><p>Sullivan jabbed with his bayonet, shout- </p><p>ing with laughter. Another hit out with </p><p>an entrenching tool. The rat driven into </p><p>a corner made a sudden spring at Kenyon. </p><p>“Oh, my God!” </p><p> A cold terror seized him. He could feel</p><p>the beast clinging to his sleeve, trying to </p><p>clamber up to his shoulder. </p><p>“Take it off!” His voice broke sharply. </p><p>“Take it off, for God’s sake, some one!” </p><p>He shook his arm wildly, frantic with fear, </p><p>and the rat was flung against the sandbags. </p><p> Sullivan, still laughing, brought his butt</p><p>down hard on the creature’s head, spattering </p><p>brains and blood on the duckboard. </p><p> Kenyon fought down a desire to be sick.</p><p>All his strength seemed to have left him: </p><p>he knew that his face was white and that </p><p>he was shivering all over, but the rat was </p><p>dead and harmless, and he did not care. </p><p> “Lord!” he laughed and spoke in a tone</p><p>of voice which even to himself sounded </p><p>blustering and forced. </p><p> “I can’t bear the sight of those things.</p><p>I never could. I thought the brute had </p><p>bitten me.” </p><p> O’Hara’s eyes twinkled.</p><p> “Kenyon, I’m agreeably surprised. In</p><p>fact I’m delighted.” </p><p> “How?” said Kenyon. “I don’t under-</p><p>stand.” </p><p> “It restores my sense of self-respect to</p><p>know that there’s one thing at least that </p><p>you fight shy of.” </p><p> “But,” Kenyon hesitated, wondering if</p><p>O’Hara were laughing at him or not. “But, </p><p>O’Hara, you don’t expect, - it! You </p><p>don’t expect me to make pets of the- </p><p>things!” </p><p> “No, of course not. I loathe rats myself.</p><p>What makes me so glad is the thought that </p><p>you’re a human being with limitations the </p><p>same as the rest of us.” </p><p> Kenyon grunted.</p><p> “I’d rather go over the top any day than</p><p>have one of those beasts touch me.” </p><p> And O’Hara, knowing what Kenyon had</p><p>done under fire, knew that he meant what </p><p>he said. But O’Hara was not the only one </p><p>to notice Kenyon’s lapse into fear. </p><p> The men saw and chuckled.</p><p> “That bangs Banagher!” said O’Grady.</p><p>“An’ him afther marchin’ as cool as ye </p><p>plaze through a barrage o’ five-nines </p><p>without turnin’ a hair of his head.” </p><p> “We have found him out at lasht,” said</p><p>Sullivan. “ ’Tis the rats that has him </p><p>In the Dug-Out </p><p>121 </p><p>scairt! Faith, I know now he’s flesh an’ </p><p>blood same as the rist of us.” </p><p> “An’ not a-mechanical conthrivance</p><p>for killin’ Germans,” said another. “By </p><p>dam’, I had to laugh at him.” </p><p> But the shame of his encounter with the</p><p>rat remained with Kenyon for days. His </p><p>pride had been humbled. Even his own </p><p>men, who should look up to him as one </p><p>without fear or without reproach, must </p><p>have seen his terror. Not even the news </p><p>that he would in all probability gain a much </p><p>coveted decoration, as a recognition of his </p><p>daring when he went through the barrage, </p><p>could comfort him. </p><p> He had faced the most terrible of dangers,</p><p>unmoved: but a rat had shamed him in the </p><p>eyes of all. His dignity had been lowered, </p><p>his pride shaken. </p><p>AND then came the disaster that </p><p>caused Kenyon’s downfall. </p><p> The South Irish Fusiliers, ad-</p><p>vancing in long waves, had stormed the </p><p>shattered, death-dealing mounds of brick </p><p>and mortar which marked what once, but </p><p>a few days before, had been a village </p><p>nestling amid trees and gardens. There had </p><p>been some fierce and bloody fighting with </p><p>bomb and bayonet among the ruins before </p><p>the enemy machine gunners had been </p><p>hunted out of their lairs, and the South </p><p>Irish had passed on, leaving their dead to </p><p>be picked up by their stretcher-bearers. </p><p> On the further side of the village Kenyon</p><p>and his company had occupied a battered </p><p>trench in support of another company in </p><p>front: the parapets had been leveled, </p><p>traverses had been obliterated, great shells </p><p>had split the firebays into wide craters, </p><p>even the entrances to the deep dug-outs </p><p>where the German garrison had sought </p><p>shelter from the storm of steel had been </p><p>rushed and broken. </p><p> Dead Germans caught by high ex-</p><p>plosives in the bombardment before the </p><p>charge, or killed when the Fusiliers burst </p><p>in on them with the bayonet, lay on every</p><p>side in the strained attitudes of death. </p><p> Kenyon passed along the trench, driv-</p><p>ing his tired men to work, giving them no </p><p>time for rest, intent only on strengthening </p><p>the position they had won before ever </p><p>the inevitable counter-thrust could reach </p><p>them. </p><p>“Come on now, get to work you fellows. </p><p>You’ve no time for idling. You, there, start </p><p>filling those sandbags—make haste! Turn </p><p>the parapet the other way.” </p><p> “Is there no chance for a bite to ait,</p><p>sorr?” Sullivan, his red face streaked with </p><p>great smears of dust and sweat, his tunic </p><p>unbuttoned and his shirt open to the sun, </p><p>was speaking. </p><p> “There is not,” said Kenyon. “Do you</p><p>think that the Germans love you so much </p><p>they’ll let you sit here and take tea? </p><p>You’ve no time to waste. Get on with </p><p>your work.” He looked about him. “Ser- </p><p>geant, turn those men to. Sharply, now, </p><p>no idling!” </p><p> He passed on. The men, dog-tired and</p><p>hungry as they were, growled and swore </p><p>but did as they were ordered, shoveling </p><p>the earth into sandbags and piling them </p><p>on to what had been the parados, clearing </p><p>the trench of the debris, preparing for what </p><p>they knew must come. </p><p> “A harrd man, but a gran’ sojer! Did ye</p><p>see him leggin’ it through thim ruins awhile </p><p>back an’ the Germans yellin’ blue </p><p>murrdher?” </p><p> “I wonder how many he kilt. I seen him</p><p>down three with his revolver, meself.” </p><p>“Will he iver learn wisdom?” said </p><p>O’Grady. </p><p> “Or know the manin’ of fear? He’s a</p><p>merricle of a man in a fight! Afraid of </p><p>nothin’ in this wurrld or the next!” </p><p>“Barrin’ the rats,” said Sullivan, “ye’re </p><p>shpakin’ the thruth! An’ may the divil </p><p>blishter our artillery for battherin’ this </p><p>thrench the way they have us slavin’ our </p><p>guts out!” </p><p> “Shtow yer gab!” shouted the company</p><p>sergeant-major. “Work now, the lot o’ ye!”</p><p>A shell came shrieking toward the trench </p><p>and burst within fifty yards with a deep </p><p>roar. A column of black smoke shot up and </p><p>a piece of heavy metal whanged viciously </p><p>against the sandbags. </p><p> “There go the crumps. That’s the first</p><p>of ’em. They’ll give us hell now, bhoys: </p><p>you see if they don’t!” </p><p> Shell followed shell in quick succession:</p><p>through the crash of the explosions could </p><p>be heard the incessant screeching of their </p><p>downward rush: the air was heavy with </p><p>the smell of high explosives, clouds of thick </p><p>smoke enveloped everything, making it </p><p>difficult to see. </p><p> The men were restless and Kenyon</p><p>steadied them. </p><p> “It’s not us they’re shelling,” he shouted.</p><p>122 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>“It’s B Company in the trench in front of </p><p>us. Keep on working there. You, Flana- </p><p>gan, do you hear me? Take up that shovel </p><p>again. At once!” </p><p> As a hard fighter the Irish soldier is</p><p>unsurpassable, that is acknowledged, but </p><p>he has his moods. To be forced to work </p><p>imder heavy shell-fire, to fill sandbags and </p><p>build up parapets anew, to dig out traverses </p><p>and join shell-hole to shell-hole, when at </p><p>any moment the enemy might launch a </p><p>sudden attack, was not to the liking of </p><p>Kenyon’s men. Also, though no shells had </p><p>as yet landed in the trench itself, though it </p><p>seemed clear that Kenyon was right and </p><p>that the Germans were shelling the trench </p><p>in front and the village behind their backs, </p><p>nevertheless for how long would they be </p><p>immune? Kenyon could see by their faces </p><p>that they were troubled and uneasy. </p><p> A shell burst with a crash close up to the</p><p>parapet and a man dropped his shovel and </p><p>ran for the slanting doorway of a dug-out. </p><p> Kenyon grabbed him by the collar and</p><p>jerked him back. </p><p> “You stay where you are, my friend.</p><p>I’ll have no skulking in dug-outs before </p><p>there’s any real need of it. Build that </p><p>parapet deeper: that’s not going to keep </p><p>a bullet out. And it’s not your own- </p><p>rotten carcass I’m thinking of, either!” </p><p> As he moved on, he heard a laugh.</p><p>“Did ye hear that, now?” asked Sullivan </p><p>chuckling. </p><p> “All the same, if ye’re hit by a shell it’s</p><p>aiqual whether the Germans meant it fer </p><p>you or the nixt fella. An’ that’s no lie.” </p><p>Kenyon agreed. In that the speaker </p><p>was most probably right. Nevertheless, </p><p>shells or no shells, until they had finished </p><p>rebuilding the trench, his men must work. </p><p> “LUK at that, will ye! There’s</p><p> some wan cornin’.”</p><p> Through the drifting smoke Ken-</p><p>yon saw a figure approaching the trench,</p><p>moving slowly over the rough ground. </p><p> “ ’Tis Misther O’Hara!” said the com-</p><p>pany sergeant-major. “An’ he walkin’ like </p><p>he was hurt!” </p><p> Kenyon waited, wondering if O’Hara</p><p>brought tidings of disaster, or what. Then </p><p>as he drew nearer he saw that he was limp- </p><p>ing, that his right hand, the sleeve hanging </p><p>loose from the shoulder, was thrust inside </p><p>his unbuttoned tunic, and that his left </p><p>thigh was drenched with blood. </p><p> “All right, O’Hara, I’m coming.”</p><p> Kenyon clambered out of the trench.</p><p> “What’s the matter, old chap? Hurt</p><p>much?” </p><p> “Hurt,” said the boy. “A little.” His</p><p>lips twisted into a worried smile. “I had </p><p>to come back, anyway. M’Keever made </p><p>me.” He swayed and steadied himself </p><p>against Kenyon’s hand. “Sorry! I’m </p><p>all to pieces, Kenyon. Silly, isn’t it!” </p><p>“Come back, sorr, for God’s sake,” said </p><p>the sergeant-major. “Ye’re axin’ for </p><p>throuble the way ye’re sthandin’ out there. </p><p>Come back at wance!” </p><p> Kenyon led O’Hara into the trench,</p><p>supporting him by one arm around his </p><p>shoulders. </p><p> “I’m going to send you back on a</p><p>stretcher, O’Hara. The quicker the M. O. </p><p>sees you the better. Sergeant-Major, pass </p><p>the word along for the stretcher-bearers at </p><p>the double.” </p><p> “I’m feeling - queer,” said O’Hara</p><p>in a weak voice. “I can’t—last out much </p><p>longer, Kenyon. It’s—it’s my head.” </p><p>“Here,” said Kenyon, “you’d better he </p><p>down somewhere and rest.” </p><p> “I doubt if you’ll find any sthretcher-</p><p>bearers, sorr,” said the sergeant-major. </p><p>“O’Reilly got killed awhile back an’ </p><p>Moriarty’s afther takin’ another fella off </p><p>to hilp carry Corp’ral Ryan to the docthor. </p><p>Ryan’s bad with a bullet in his sthomach. </p><p>But you can’t lave Misther O’Hara here.” </p><p>The shriek of an approaching shell grow- </p><p>ing louder and louder each instant cut short </p><p>the sergeant-major’s words.</p><p> “Get down!” shouted Kenyon. “Get</p><p>down!” </p><p> The shell burst with a deafening ear-</p><p>splitting roar at the far end of the firebay, </p><p>covering the two officers and the sergeant- </p><p>major with a shower of chalk and stones. </p><p> O’Hara lay as though dead, his sound</p><p>arm shielding his face. </p><p> Kenyon bent over him.</p><p> “Are you all right, O’Hara?”</p><p> O’Hara began to whimper.</p><p> “Oh, my God, Kenyon, I’m done for!</p><p>Don’t let them get me!” </p><p> He sat up and clutched at Kenyon’s arm.</p><p>Stark and hideous terror showed in the </p><p>boy’s eyes; his lips quivered; he was shak- </p><p>ing all over. </p><p> “It’s those-shells, Kenyon. I can’t</p><p>hold out any longer. They’ll get me, </p><p>I know they will. They can’t help it if we </p><p>In the Dug-Out </p><p>123 </p><p>stay here. Take me away, Kenyon, for </p><p>God’s sake! Take me out of it; you must!” </p><p>The voice had risen to a scream. </p><p> Kenyon felt a sudden hot shame surge</p><p>through him; that an officer in his battalion, </p><p>one of his greatest friends, as brave a man </p><p>ordinarily as ever lived, should have </p><p>collapsed so hopelessly seemed almost un- </p><p>believable. That it was O’Hara of all </p><p>men, made it worse. Never before had </p><p>Kenyon known such fear in a human being. </p><p>It was more painful than anything he had </p><p>witnessed previously on the battle-field. </p><p> Why should shell-fire, however heavy,</p><p>rob a man of his manhood? It was an </p><p>officer’s duty to show his men how to face </p><p>death, yet here was O’Hara, a man to whom </p><p>he owed his life, shivering with terror, </p><p>cowering at the bottom of the trench, </p><p>begging piteously to be moved to safety. </p><p> Kenyon was not hard-hearted, but it was</p><p>neither right nor seemly that ordinary </p><p>privates should see an officer so humiliated. </p><p>Wounds or no wounds, O’Hara should have </p><p>more control. </p><p> “We’d besht take him into the dug-out,</p><p>sorr,” said the sergeant-major. “He’s in </p><p>no fit shtate to be moved with thim shellin’ </p><p>the village.” </p><p> Kenyon nodded, and helped O’Hara to</p><p>his feet. A few yards from where they </p><p>stood was an entrance to a dug-out, half </p><p>choked by debris. </p><p> “Sergeant-Major,” said Kenyon, “that</p><p>dug-out’s clear, isn’t it?” </p><p> “It is, sorr. Shall I call a couple of min,</p><p>sorr, to lind you a hand?” </p><p>“No, I’ll take him down myself. O’Hara, </p><p>can you hobble along on that leg of vours?” </p><p>“A little,” said O’Hara feebly. “It </p><p>hurts—like -, but I’ll try. Only—get </p><p>me away out of this, for God’s sake!” </p><p> He was weeping like a frightened child.</p><p>His breath came in deep sobs. His skin</p><p>had taken on a corpse-like pallor. </p><p>“Don't leave me, Kenyon, will you?” </p><p>Kenyon looked at him in pity: his anger </p><p>and shame vanished. Poor old O’Hara! </p><p>Was it possible that any one so good as he </p><p>could have gone to pieces so completely? </p><p> “Come on, old chap, I’m going to put</p><p>you into a dug-out, till I can get you taken </p><p>away. Sergeant-Major, I’ll be back in a </p><p>minute. Make these men build up that </p><p>parapet again. Keep ’em working!” And </p><p>with one arm about the wounded boy’s </p><p>waist guided him toward the dug-out. </p><p>“Rest all your weight on my back,” he </p><p>said, “and put your sound arm around my </p><p>neck. Steady now, and I’ll have you down </p><p>in no time.” </p><p> Very slowly and carefully so as to cause</p><p>as little pain as possible, Kenyon half- </p><p>supported, half-carried O’Hara down the </p><p>steep stairs that led out of the blazing </p><p>sunshine, down past a passage that crossed </p><p>the stairs at right angles, down and down </p><p>into the darkness of the dug-out. </p><p> “You’ll be safe here,” he said. “Hold</p><p>up now, old chap, till I get you a light.” </p><p> He struck a match and lit a candle</p><p>which he had in his haversack. By its </p><p>feeble glimmer he could see the four walls </p><p>of the dug-out and a shelf piled up with </p><p>rubbish; in one corner, a narrow bed made </p><p>of a wooden frame and thin strips of iron </p><p>on which were brown and filthy-looking </p><p>blankets and a litter of fusty straw that </p><p>smelled of rats; in the center of the dug- </p><p>out, a broken table lying on its side; on the </p><p>floor more straw, paper stained with blood, </p><p>a German shrapnel helmet, fragments of </p><p>food, empty bottles, equipment and rifles: </p><p>hanging on hooks opposite the bed an old </p><p>field-gray overcoat, a pickelhaube and some </p><p>odd garments. At a glance Kenyon knew </p><p>that the dug-out had been bombed, and </p><p>he wondered if the occupants, if any, had </p><p>managed to escape before the South Irish </p><p>had reached the trench. </p><p> He fixed the candle in a pool of its own</p><p>grease on a corner of the shelf: then, still </p><p>with the same care, almost amazed by his </p><p>own new-born tenderness, he helped O’Hara </p><p>on to the bed.</p><p> “You’ll be all right here, old chap,” he</p><p>said. “Nothing can touch you. You </p><p>won’t mind if I get back to the trench </p><p>though, will you?” </p><p> “You mustn’t leave me, Kenyon—you</p><p>mustn’t.” </p><p> The wounded man’s voice was little more</p><p>than a whisper. </p><p> “I must, O’Hara. You wouldn’t have</p><p>me leave the men, would you?” </p><p> O’Hara moaned faintly.</p><p> “Don’t leave me alone, Kenyon, I can’t</p><p>bear it.” </p><p> Kenyon knew that he must be firm. He</p><p>had been absent from his men too long </p><p>already. Supposing that even now the </p><p>trench in front had given away! </p><p> “I’m going, O’Hara. Can’t help it. I</p><p>must.” </p><p>124 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> But as he spoke, frantic to be gone, yet</p><p>not wishing to appear unkind, there came </p><p>a sudden whistling screech and with the </p><p>most appalling burst of sound, a crash as </p><p>of the heavens splitting asunder, a shell </p><p>exploded on the stairs. The dug-out, </p><p>plunged into darkness, rocked with the </p><p>concussion, Kenyon was hurled back against </p><p>the timbered wall, the floor seemed to rise </p><p>up under his feet and hit him, and he fell </p><p>forward, his senses numbed, seeing nothing, </p><p>hearing dully the echoes dying away and </p><p>the noise of earth falling. </p><p> He rose to his feet, shaken and swearing</p><p>softly, coughing as the dust settled on his </p><p>lungs. Then he laughed aloud. </p><p> “That’s lucky!” he said. “The blasted</p><p>thing must have landed slap in the entrance. </p><p>By Jove! I might have been half-way up </p><p>the stairs.” </p><p> He struck a match with a steady hand</p><p>and lit the candle which had fallen. </p><p> O’Hara lay quite still with his sound arm</p><p>once more protecting his face. </p><p> Kenyon, his nerves untouched by what</p><p>had happened, but with the necessity for </p><p>reaching his men uppermost in his mind, </p><p>and fearing that O’Hara might again detain </p><p>him, made for the entrance. </p><p> And then he stopped, sick with appre-</p><p>hension. His blood ran cold and his heart </p><p>skipped a beat or two. </p><p> For the stairs up which he must climb</p><p>to reach his company were blocked roof- </p><p>high with masses of stone and chalk and </p><p>earth and timber. Sick with horror, he </p><p>clutched at a bulk of timber and tugged. </p><p>It did not move, and he knew then that </p><p>the shell had blown in the entrance to the </p><p>dug-out and that all escape was barred. </p><p>Unless help should come he was a prisoner, </p><p>and perhaps even now his men were fighting! </p><p>KENYON looked at the solid planks </p><p>that formed the dug-out’s walls and </p><p>what hope was left died within him. </p><p> Then once more he turned to the en-</p><p>trance, and filled with sudden, frantic rage </p><p>began to claw at the debris that blocked </p><p>his path, tearing out stones and earth with </p><p>his hands, exerting his utmost strength to </p><p>move the timber that, wedged fast between </p><p>the roof and stairs, presented an impene- </p><p>trable barrier. </p><p> He had forbidden his men to enter the</p><p>dug-outs, yet here was he, their officer, </p><p>who should have been with them in their </p><p>trench, sharing the dangers that beset </p><p>them, trapped in a dug-out. And no mat- </p><p>ter what efforts he put forth, no matter </p><p>how hard he worked, single-handed he </p><p>could not escape. Of that he was certain. </p><p>To be rescued, he must be rescued from </p><p>above—or not at all. </p><p> He stepped back and surveyed the pile of</p><p>stones and earth that he had scattered at </p><p>the doorway. The muscles of his arms </p><p>and back ached with the toil, the sweat </p><p>trickled down his face and neck. He had </p><p>done his best, and to what purpose? As </p><p>well might he try to demolish the whole </p><p>dug-out as to clear a passage to the open </p><p>air. He was a prisoner until a party should </p><p>rescue him. And supposing the Germans </p><p>were to recapture the trench! </p><p> He laughed shortly. Then he remem-</p><p>bered O’Hara and crossed the small dug- </p><p>out to where the wounded man lay on the </p><p>bed in the corner. </p><p> “O’Hara,” he said.</p><p> O’Hara’s face was like gray wax in the</p><p>light of the candle, his eyes were closed, his </p><p>Ups parted. </p><p> “O’Hara, old man, how are you feeling?”</p><p> But O’Hara neither moved nor spoke.</p><p> Kenyon, with a sinking heart, touched</p><p>him gently. And then he understood. </p><p> O’Hara, whom he had tried to help, was</p><p>dead. </p><p> For a time Kenyon did not move.</p><p>Accustomed though he was to death in all </p><p>its forms, nevertheless O’Hara’s death </p><p>stirred him to the depths of his being. It </p><p>was not as though he had died a soldier’s</p><p>death, in the open and under the sky; </p><p>O’Hara, brave and witty and happy, had </p><p>died—Kenyon’s mind sought a parallel— </p><p>like a rat in a trap, in the darkness, and </p><p>afraid. O’Hara, afraid! It was incredible. </p><p>No one in the battalion had shown such </p><p>reckless gallantry as had O’Hara and then </p><p>to die as he had died, a prisoner in a Ger- </p><p>man dug-out, and afraid! The thought </p><p>shook him. </p><p> Kenyon whistled softly under his breath.</p><p>And what chance of escape had he, him- </p><p>self? The one passage to the air was </p><p>blocked. Would there even be air for him </p><p>to breathe? He sniffed the close, rat- </p><p>scented atmosphere. O’Hara had died like </p><p>a rat in a trap! Was he not also trapped? </p><p>He shivered and a sense of depression, of </p><p>horror of he knew not what, stole over him. </p><p> From where he stood, his back to the</p><p>In the Dug-Out </p><p>*25 </p><p>heap of debris, he could see the whole dug- </p><p>out, dimly lit by the candle: the walls of </p><p>perpendicular boards, the hanging gar- </p><p>ments—he wondered whether their lawful </p><p>owner were still alive, whether he were a </p><p>prisoner or still fighting—the shelves, the </p><p>broken table, the chair, the papers stained </p><p>with blood, the straw, the rifles, and the </p><p>bed in the corner with O’Hara lying dead. </p><p> Kenyon swore softly. It came to him</p><p>as a vague possibility that he too might die </p><p>in the dug-out. Supposing his men were </p><p>all killed! Who would know then what </p><p>had become of him? </p><p> And as he brooded on what might hap-</p><p>pen, each moment feeling the sense of de- </p><p>pression and dread growing within him, he </p><p>heard from a dark corner of the dug-out </p><p>where paper and books and straw had been </p><p>scattered a faint scratching. </p><p> At first he paid no heed. Then the</p><p>scratching was repeated. Suddenly alert </p><p>in every sense, he waited, scarcely daring </p><p>to draw a breath lest he miss what might </p><p>be happening. Something was moving in </p><p>the corner of the dug-out where the shad- </p><p>ows were darkest. He could see nothing </p><p>but he could hear some animal pattering </p><p>across the straw and papers. </p><p> And then two tiny beads of red fire ap-</p><p>peared in the darkness. Kenyon backed </p><p>against the wall of the dug-out, and very </p><p>slowly a huge pale-gray rat, mangy and </p><p>leprous, the biggest he had ever seen, a </p><p>monster with gleaming teeth and long </p><p>whiskers, came into the circle of yellow </p><p>candle-light and sat watching him. </p><p> Kenyon gazed at the animal in horror.</p><p>And loathing such as he had never known </p><p>before gripped him. His one impulse was </p><p>to kill. </p><p> Stooping down swiftly, he seized a lump</p><p>of white chalk and threw it with all his </p><p>strength. His throw went wide of the </p><p>mark, the chalk crunched against the wall, </p><p>and the rat turned leisurely and slunk into </p><p>the shadow. </p><p>KENYON wiped the perspiration</p><p>from off his forehead. He felt sick </p><p>with nausea. Even though no mor- </p><p>tal eyes had seen him, he was ashamed. </p><p>Excuses to justify his terror crowded into </p><p>his mind. A man, placed as he was, a </p><p>prisoner in a dug-out from which there was </p><p>no escape, might well be forgiven for losing </p><p>his control. He was not frightened, of that </p><p>he was positive. Would one who could </p><p>face shell-fire unperturbed, as he could, as </p><p>a matter of duty, be afraid because a rat, </p><p>however big or however ugly—Kenyon </p><p>shuddered—was in the same dug-out? </p><p>Impossible! Nevertheless, when once again </p><p>he heard the same stealthy rustling in the </p><p>corner, the same slow and cautious ap- </p><p>proach, he trembled. </p><p> This time the rat, if possible more re-</p><p>pulsive and loathsome than before, ambled </p><p>across the dug-out, not in Kenyon’s direc- </p><p>tion, but toward the low bed where O’Hara </p><p>was lying. It sat up on its haunches, like </p><p>a dog begging, its front paws bent, its gray </p><p>nose sniffing, its beady eyes red in the </p><p>candle-light, its naked tail twitching, until </p><p>Kenyon, breaking loose from the spell that </p><p>bound him, made a sudden wild rush at it. </p><p> How it happened, he could not tell, but</p><p>the rat avoided him clumsily and crawled </p><p>under the bed. And to Kenyon the most </p><p>horrible part of it all was that the animal </p><p>all through never hurried, never showed </p><p>the slightest fear, never recognized the fact </p><p>that he, the man, was his master. </p><p> ‘‘Come out, you devil!”</p><p> Fighting down the disgust that rose up</p><p>within him Kenyon picked up one of the Ger- </p><p>man rifles that lay in the corner and thrust </p><p>wildly at where he thought the rat would be. </p><p> “- you, you beast! If I get you,</p><p>I’ll—I’ll choke your life out!” </p><p> Blind rage against his tormentor had</p><p>taken possession of him. Even if he were </p><p>doomed never to escape, the rat would die. </p><p>For O’Hara’s sake he, who had won the D. S. </p><p>0. on the battle-field, must conquer his fear. </p><p> A slight noise made him turn quickly.</p><p>The rat was in the corner in which it had </p><p>first appeared, watching him almost as</p><p>though—Kenyon would have sworn it— </p><p>as though amused. </p><p> With a snarl of fury, losing his last rem-</p><p>nants of self-control, he hurled the heavy </p><p>rifle across the dug-out. The rat squeaked, </p><p>whether in fear or from pain he could not </p><p>tell, and Kenyon was alone with O’Hara. </p><p> But he knew, he knew as surely as though</p><p>he had been told, that his respite was not </p><p>for long. The rat would return, of course. </p><p>There was something vindictive and de- </p><p>termined in the way in which it slunk in </p><p>and out of the black shadows, something </p><p>cunning and diabolical that chilled Ken- </p><p>yon’s blood. Even for a trench-rat its </p><p>boldness was uncanny. </p><p>126 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Kenyon waited, his heart beating like a</p><p> steamer’s piston, his pulses throbbing,</p><p> straining his ears that he might not lose the</p><p> slightest sound and hearing close at hand</p><p> a scuffling and a thin squeaking, and far</p><p> away, above his head, the dull booming</p><p> that he knew so well. His men were fight-</p><p> ing maybe for their very lives, while he</p><p> who would lead them gladly against the</p><p> German trenches was sick with terror be-</p><p> cause a rat, a harmless, mangey rat, had</p><p> been imprisoned with him. He could have</p><p> cried for very shame’s sake. And had he</p><p> not in his pride despised O’Hara but a</p><p> short hour since because his nerve had</p><p> failed him?' Who was he to talk now of</p><p> manhood or courage, after this?</p><p> All at once, with a gasp of horror, as one</p><p> plunged without warning into ice-cold</p><p> water, he became aware of a lean gray form</p><p> slinking along the floor.</p><p> Kenyon drew his revolver. He would</p><p> make no move until he could see more</p><p> clearly, then a bullet would finish matters</p><p> once and for all.</p><p> But, although he had intended not to</p><p> take his gaze from off his enemy—to fire</p><p> and miss would be too awful—some instinct</p><p> forced him to turn his head quickly. He</p><p> caught his breath and could have shrieked</p><p> aloud in sheer panic. On the floor beside</p><p> the broken table were two more rats, gray</p><p> and hideous like the first, but smaller.</p><p> They watched him with fierce eyes.</p><p> Kenyon’s hand and arm were shaking</p><p> as he raised the revolver and fired. As in</p><p> a dream, he saw one of the rats flatten it-</p><p> self out, reddening the floor with its blood,</p><p> while the other scuttled to the shelter of</p><p> the straw.</p><p> With the echo of his shot reverberating</p><p> through the dug-out, Kenyon cocked his</p><p> revolver and wheeled about.</p><p> Then, his senses in a whirl, mad with fury</p><p> and fear and nausea, he fired three times</p><p> in quick succession. The big, dropsical</p><p> rat, the abomination that was driving him</p><p> mad, sat like a vulture on the edge of the</p><p> bed by the side of O’Hara’s body.</p><p> AS HE fired Kenyon knew that he</p><p> was shouting incoherently: what he</p><p> said, whether the string of words</p><p> made sense, he neither knew nor cared.</p><p> Splinters flew back as the bullets plowed</p><p> ■	into the thick planking, but the rat crawled</p><p> over O’Hara’s body and disappeared on the</p><p> far side of the bed, untouched and, even</p><p> now, unhurried in its movements. Ken-</p><p> yon stooped down and fired under the bed.</p><p> Then, dazed and sick, stunned by a new</p><p>misfortune, Kenyon straightened up. He </p><p>had one cartridge left and no more. His </p><p>pouch was empty. </p><p> For a moment there came to him the</p><p>wild thought of putting his last bullet </p><p>through his brain and so ending his agony. </p><p> But would it be ended? Could he, a</p><p>British soldier—and God, what a miserable </p><p>specimen of a British soldier—desert O’Hara </p><p>now, when he needed him most? Had </p><p>O’Hara deserted him when he lay helpless, </p><p>caught in the German barbed wire? Would </p><p>it be fair to leave O’Hara, dead, and unable </p><p>to defend himself? Was O’Hara any the </p><p>less worthy now that he no longer lived? </p><p>No, a thousand times! He would fight on </p><p>as he had always fought, coward though he </p><p>owned himself, unworthy though the enemy </p><p>might be, until he could fight no longer. </p><p> Kenyon had lost all count of time, in</p><p>carrying O’Hara he had broken his watch, </p><p>but what seemed an eternity of waiting </p><p>passed before the rat reappeared. </p><p> It was not alone. The snuffling and</p><p>squeaking behind the timbers had warned </p><p>Kenyon of what he might expect. Yet </p><p>could a rat, even a trench-rat, war’s most </p><p>loathsome product, summon help? He </p><p>laughed wildly. </p><p> They came on him suddenly. Almost</p><p>before he realized it he was fighting, laying </p><p>about him once more with the rifle, sweep- </p><p>ing a wide circle from where he stood. </p><p>Then he stopped, exhausted and despairing. </p><p>What was the good? </p><p> Some he had killed—one, two, three,</p><p>four—the others—seven of them—sat just </p><p>out of reach of his rifle, that clumsy Ger- </p><p>man weapon, and watched him. The big </p><p>gray rat, the leader—Kenyon knew it must </p><p>be the leader—was still alive. Its whole </p><p>attitude was one of mockery and scorn. </p><p>It seemed to be sneering at him, daring </p><p>him to do his worst. It could not speak </p><p>and yet to Kenyon’s tortured mind it said: </p><p> “You can not kill me. Try again, my</p><p>gallant officer, and you will find that I am </p><p>right. I am too strong, too powerful, too </p><p>clever. Who are you, proud soldier, to </p><p>strive against me? My time is coming. I </p><p>can afford to wait. Can you?” </p><p> “You fiend!” said Kenyon. “You fiend</p><p>from hell!” </p><p>In the Dug-Out </p><p>127 </p><p> He raised the rifle slowly and brought it</p><p>down swiftly with a crash, but the old rat </p><p>had moved and sat a foot further away, </p><p>blinking in cold scorn. </p><p> “Did I not tell you?” It seemed to say.</p><p>“Was I not right, my fine gentleman? You </p><p>can not harm me! Hero you might once </p><p>have been, but now you are afraid!” </p><p> “Oh, God!” said Kenyon. “Oh, God</p><p>pity me!” </p><p> Then to his unutterable shame, for it</p><p>proved how very low he had sunk, how </p><p>small a man he really was, he found that </p><p>he was weeping, sobbing with fear and </p><p>misery, as though his aching heart would </p><p>break, even as O’Hara had sobbed after the </p><p>shell had broken his nerve. </p><p> Was this the end then? Must he die</p><p>like this, deep underground, surrounded by </p><p>rats, a prisoner, robbed of every manly </p><p>virtue he had possessed? Once he had </p><p>been proud, and justly proud, of what he </p><p>was; now rats had proved to him his </p><p>folly. </p><p> Suddenly, without warning, and it only</p><p>wanted this disaster to complete his misery, </p><p>the candle, his one comfort, flickered and </p><p>went out, leaving him in darkness blacker </p><p>than the blackest night. And with the </p><p>darkness came terror such as he had never </p><p>known, a terror that was agony, a terror </p><p>that stole from him his last remaining shred </p><p>of self-respect and filled him with a blind </p><p>desire to shriek for mercy, to force his way </p><p>out of his prison at all costs, to pray, to </p><p>scream, or else to die quickly, before terror </p><p>killed him. </p><p> Shaking all over, his very strength sapped</p><p>by fear, he fumbled through his pockets </p><p>lest perchance a piece of candle still re- </p><p>mained. He found only letters, letters </p><p>from his wife, letters he might have an- </p><p>swered, a pocketbook, a bank-note-case </p><p>full of French notes and some silver </p><p>francs. </p><p> The scuffling and rustling and squeaking</p><p>was growing louder and more insistent. </p><p>With the coming of the darkness the</p><p>rats were bolder. Their smell sickened </p><p>him. </p><p> He struck a match, and holding it aloft</p><p>shrank from the sight that met his eyes— </p><p>eight, nine, ten—twelve—fifteen rats. The </p><p>light burned his 'fingers and went out, leav- </p><p>ing with him, as a last impression, the big </p><p>rat, the gray, scabrous beast, sitting on </p><p>its haunches not a yard away. </p><p>WITH that desperation that is fear </p><p>pushed beyond all endurance, Ken- </p><p>yon fired his revolver: then dashing </p><p>forward blindly he kicked something soft </p><p>and flabby and stumbling over the table </p><p>fell with a crash on hands and knees. </p><p>Sharp teeth met in the fleshy part of his </p><p>thumb. He screamed aloud in insane </p><p>panic and hit out madly with his revolver. </p><p>And as he dealt blows right and left in the </p><p>darkness, still on his knees, sobbing like </p><p>some hysterical woman, he called to mind </p><p>the memory of other days—such happy </p><p>days they seemed—when he, an officer in </p><p>the Royal South Irish Fusiliers—long lines </p><p>of khaki with the bayonets dazzling in the </p><p>sunshine—had fought by the light of day </p><p>with human brings. Now, alone and far </p><p>from all help, a clumsy mountebank, a </p><p>laughing stock, he fought with rats! And </p><p>in this last most terrible battle there would </p><p>be no quarter. </p><p> Doomed to die—like a rat! Words of</p><p>fire danced before his eyes. </p><p> Like a rat! He hit out with savage</p><p>energy, cursing like any foul-mouthed </p><p>private—he, the poet, the scholar, the </p><p>hero—and crawled slowly around the floor, </p><p>driving his enemy before him, feeling with </p><p>the fascination of horror the soft fur bodies </p><p>of the slain. </p><p> Anon, exhausted, panting for breath, he</p><p>staggered to his feet and groped his way to </p><p>where O’Hara was lying. </p><p> He must not desert O’Hara, of course.</p><p>O’Hara had saved him from the Germans: </p><p>he would save O’Hara from the rats. He </p><p>would stay with him to the end. What </p><p>end? He wondered. Was lie going mad? </p><p>God in heaven! He had no choice? He </p><p>made a virtue of what must be. Stay with </p><p>O’Hara! How could he leave him? What </p><p>way of escape was there? He was doomed</p><p>—doomed to die like a rat, fighting rats. </p><p> And after that there followed a lifetime</p><p>of horror. The blackness choked him, </p><p>enveloped him like a pall. His tongue, a </p><p>strip of dried leather, clave to the roof of </p><p>his mouth, the pit of his stomach seemed </p><p>sunk and empty, cold waves of fear swept </p><p>over him, the blood thundered in his ears, </p><p>his eyes, open to their widest, ached with the </p><p>strain of trying to pierce the blackness. </p><p> And as he crouched beside the dead</p><p>boy, his hands moved to and fro, up and </p><p>down, ceaselessly, feeling in each direction, </p><p>touching from time to time O’Hara’s thin </p><p>128 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>features or his hands or his body to reassure </p><p>himself that all was well. When, as often </p><p>happened, his fingers came in contact with </p><p>a rat, loathing and terror would overwhelm </p><p>him and he would strike with his bare fists </p><p>or make a sudden grab and sometimes, to </p><p>his horror, find himself gripping a strug- </p><p>gling, squirming, biting handful of fur and </p><p>nails and teeth. And never for one in- </p><p>stant did the rustling and scuffling and </p><p>squeaking and pattering of feet cease. </p><p> Never was he free from the knowledge</p><p>that behind his back the big, gray rats were </p><p>watching him, biding their time, exulting </p><p>in his degradation. He, who had been </p><p>proud, was in their power. </p><p> And then when flesh and blood could no</p><p>longer stand the strain, when he felt that </p><p>madness in grim earnest was coming, he </p><p>lit one of his last three matches. It splut- </p><p>tered and flared up. </p><p> At the foot of the bed sat the big, pale-</p><p>gray rat, hideous and bloated, its eyes </p><p>blinking with the knowledge of all evil, its </p><p>pointed nose sniffing and turned this way </p><p>and that, its purpose unconcealed. </p><p> The match went out and Kenyon, shout-</p><p>ing wild curses, made a grab at the monster. </p><p> When, a little later he put the muzzle of</p><p>the revolver to his head and pulled the </p><p>trigger, the click of the hammer mocked </p><p>his effort. The bullet he had meant to </p><p>save had been wasted. It was not his fate </p><p>to die by his own hand; he must fight while </p><p>life lasted. Did he not belong to the South </p><p>Irish, a regiment that had never yet given </p><p>in to an enemy? Was he to give in now? </p><p> And once more, his breath was coming</p><p>in deep sobs, he began the slow, groping, </p><p>circular movement with his hands, knowing </p><p>that on every side were rats, ten, twenty, </p><p>thirty, forty—God alone knew the number </p><p>—surrounding him, closing in nearer and </p><p>nearer, watching him with red eyes, licking </p><p>their Ups, certain of their prey. </p><p>PRIVATE SULLIVAN clutched at </p><p>Lance-Corporal 0’Grady’s arm. </p><p> “WhistI What the divil’s that,</p><p>Terence?” </p><p> The two soldiers halted and listened.</p><p> The dug-out in which they stood, the</p><p>fourth in succession which they had entered </p><p>without going above ground, differed in no </p><p>wise from the others they had ransacked; </p><p>there was the same look of desolation, the </p><p>same unwholesome smell of damp garments </p><p>and decayed straw and rats, the same litter </p><p>of equipment and scraps of food on floor </p><p>and table, the same untidy bedding on the </p><p>bunks built up, shipboard-fashion, one </p><p>above the other against the walls. </p><p> But the deep stillness of the other rooms</p><p>of this human warren, a stillness that had </p><p>been broken only by the distant thunder </p><p>of the guns, was gone. From close at hand </p><p>there came a faint groaning as of one in </p><p>deepest agony and the sound of slow and </p><p>tired footsteps shuffling wearily to and fro. </p><p> “ ’Tis some one in another room,” said</p><p>O’Grady. </p><p> Sullivan gazed about him. The noise</p><p>most surely came from the other side of the </p><p>wall at the further end of the dug-out. </p><p> “Isn’t that a door yonda?” he said sud-</p><p>denly. “Lukl” </p><p> They moved slowly toward the door</p><p>which was built of the same thick timbers </p><p>as those that lined the walls. </p><p> The moaning seemed fainter, the foot-</p><p>steps had stopped. </p><p> “What is it, Dan? Is it a German?”</p><p> “Open it quick!” said Sullivan.</p><p> O’Grady puUed at the wooden latch and</p><p>stood aside as the door swung slowly in- </p><p>ward, his rifle in his hands, ready for what </p><p>might come. </p><p> SuUivan held up his candle and peered</p><p>into the blackness. </p><p> “Howly Mither of God!” he cried and</p><p>started back. </p><p> For standing in the dug-out, staring at</p><p>him with wild, red-rimmed eyes and gray, </p><p>corpse-Uke face, was a man muttering to </p><p>himself, clad in torn, blood-stained khaki. </p><p>Beside him stretched on a low bed, was a </p><p>dead body, half-covered with a brown </p><p>blanket. And on the floor were rats; a </p><p>score, at least, all dead and mangled. </p><p> “By Jasus, ’tis Captain Kenyon,” said</p><p>O’Grady in a shocked whisper. “Him </p><p>what we were thinking was killed yestiday!” </p><p> “For pity’s sake!” said Sullivan hoarsely.</p><p>“Luk, will ye! The inthrance is aU </p><p>shtopped up. Poor fella!” </p><p> “But did he not see that there was a</p><p>door?” said O’Grady. </p><p> And as the two soldiers, bewildered and</p><p>startled by what met their eyes, watched, </p><p>the scarecrow whom they had foUowed </p><p>into battle, their officer, gave a hoarse, </p><p>shrfll scream and with bloody hands flung </p><p>himself on a huge gray rat which was </p><p>crawling slowly away into the shadows. </p><p>In the Dug-Out </p><p>129 </p><p> “I’ve got you!” shouted the scarecrow.</p><p>“I’ve got you, you old devil! You thought </p><p>you’d escape, but you couldn’t — you </p><p>couldn’t—you hell’s fiend—we never give </p><p>in—we-” </p><p> Then he stood up, the dead rat in his red</p><p>hands, and began to laugh so strangely and </p><p>so mirthlessly that the two soldiers shrank </p><p>back out of his reach. </p><p> “What is it?” said O’Grady in a hushed</p><p>voice. “What’s he afther doing?” </p><p> “He’s an orf’cer,” said Sullivan, “an’ a</p><p>good man. Terence, there’s been quare </p><p>wurrk here this past night. We’d besht be </p><p>gittin’ him away at wance. Captain Ken- </p><p>yon, yer honor,” he spoke gently and sooth- </p><p>ingly, as though to a child, “will yerself </p><p>not come up into the fresh air, an’ have a </p><p>luk at the bhoys?” </p><p> The officer passed his hand wearily</p><p>across his forehead. </p><p> “Kenyon,” he said in a low voice. “Yes</p><p>—of course, I’m Kenyon. I’ve been here— </p><p>a long time, eh? In the dark, fighting— </p><p>fighting with those devils.” </p><p> But when they tried to lead him away</p><p>he resisted. </p><p> “And leave him!” he pointed to the dead</p><p>body. “With them!” He gave another </p><p>wild laugh. “My God, no!” </p><p> He had fought with the rats for O’Hara’s</p><p>sake and he had won. Was he to hand </p><p>over his friend now? That the dug-out had </p><p>another entrance, that the door was hid- </p><p>den by the hanging clothes, that a push </p><p>would have opened a way of escape, he </p><p>neither knew nor cared. He had beaten </p><p>off the rats and O’Hara was saved. Noth- </p><p>ing else mattered. </p><p> Not until they had lifted O’Hara from</p><p>the bed on which he had died and borne </p><p>him through into the next dug-out and so </p><p>on into another and up the steep steps into </p><p>the open air did Kenyon feel that his work </p><p>was done.</p><p> It was dawn, the sun had risen and was</p><p>shining from a clear blue sky, soft white </p><p>clouds touched with pink sailed slowly </p><p>overhead, a faint breeze blew from the </p><p>westward; the purple and violet and gold </p><p>at a distant hillside showed up beyond the </p><p>dark green woods in front; red poppies and </p><p>white daisies nodded in the grass; every- </p><p>thing was clean and fresh and beautiful. </p><p> Kenyon, conscious of a strange peace,</p><p>stared about him. The dull thunder of </p><p>the guns that never rested, night or day, </p><p>and the dead lying in the chalk with cov- </p><p>ered faces, brought to his mind a sugges- </p><p>tion of some past horror. He dyed the </p><p>men in the trench distrustfully. Who were </p><p>they? He did not know them. Had they </p><p>seen him before, these dirty, unshaven men </p><p>in khaki? He wondered. Perhaps, though </p><p>they were friends. Perhaps they would </p><p>share his triumph. </p><p> “Look!” he said. “Look here!” He</p><p>held by its tail the big, gray rat. He </p><p>laughed aloud. “See it! Isn’t it a beauty? </p><p>I killed it.” His rage and terror returned. </p><p>“You devil!” He shuddered with uncon- </p><p>trollable loathing. “You beast—take it </p><p>away, quick—oh, my God! Some one—for </p><p>God’s sake!” His voice rose to a scream. </p><p>“Take it away—quick, or it’ll kill me.” </p><p>Then, shaking off the spell that gripped </p><p>him, he hurled the rat over the battered </p><p>parapet and laughed triumphantly, staring </p><p>from man to man, until all at once he broke </p><p>off as if about to choke and, clutching at </p><p>Sullivan’s arm, began to weep, begging to </p><p>be taken away from the trenches or they— </p><p>he did not say who—would kill him. </p><p> “He was like that in the dug-out,” said</p><p>Sullivan dryly, “only not so bad.” </p><p> “He’s mad, that’s what’s the matther,”</p><p>said the company sergeant-major, “an’ ’tis </p><p>shell-shock that’s afther doin’ the damage </p><p>—whin the dug-out was blown in on top of </p><p>him. The besht orf’cer in the battalion, </p><p>the bravest man iver I seen in it, an’ cast </p><p>yer eyes on him now! Dear, dear! Let’s </p><p>be gettin’ him out o’ this. Come, sorr, </p><p>come with me. Sure, ye’re all right now. </p><p>There’s no call to worry!” </p><p> The M. O., even before he had heard</p><p>what had happened to the dug-out, said it </p><p>was shell-shock, the worst case he had ever </p><p>had the misfortune to see. Kenyon scarce- </p><p>ly understood; he did not care what they </p><p>called it; all he asked for was to be taken </p><p>away from the war. </p><p> There was only the one thing to do; they</p><p>sent him to England, a broken, white-faced </p><p>wreck with terror lurking in his sunken eyes, </p><p>a poor, sick man who cried weakly when </p><p>left by himself with no one near at hand to </p><p>call in case they, his enemies, found him. </p><p>THERE came a day when he was </p><p>well enough to see his wife. </p><p> She sat by his bedside and held</p><p>his hand in hers. Kenyon felt strangely </p><p>comforted and yet ashamed, almost too </p><p>9 </p><p>130 </p><p>i </p><p>Adventure </p><p>ashamed to look her in the face and tell her </p><p>he was happy now at last. </p><p> She was too good for him, he knew. He</p><p>wondered, stabbed deep with remorse, why, </p><p>why in the past dead years before mankind </p><p>went mad, he had been so blind? Now it </p><p>was too late. How could he, a coward, </p><p>dare to hope that any woman, much less </p><p>this perfect woman, could still love him? </p><p>How could he, who had shown himself </p><p>unfit to be a soldier, who had disgraced his </p><p>regiment, hold up his head again? And </p><p>he, a coward, had dared look down on poor </p><p>O’Hara, the finest man God ever made! </p><p> It was not until Kenyon had left the</p><p>hospital and had for three long weeks been </p><p>forced by Fate to act a lie, that the truth </p><p>came out. </p><p> On a still calm evening in September, he</p><p>and his wife walked side by side between </p><p>tall dark hedges of box. The sun had set </p><p>in a blaze of glory and the sky still glowed </p><p>crimson and gold in the west, rooks cawed </p><p>sleepily in the elm-trees behind the house </p><p>and from near at hand a thrush sang a last </p><p>good night. </p><p> From time to time some irresistible im-</p><p>pulse would urge Kenyon to glance over </p><p>his shoulder, as though suspicious that </p><p>something—he was stronger now, but he </p><p>would not say w'hat, even to himself— </p><p>were following at his heels. </p><p> His wife slipped an arm through his.</p><p> “Old boy, what is it?”</p><p> And then he stopped and releasing her</p><p>arm gently, stood studying the freshness of </p><p>her beauty. </p><p> “What is it, Alan? Why are you looking</p><p>at me like that?” </p><p> He pulled himself together. The part</p><p>he played sickened him. Yet play it he </p><p>must to the bitter end. </p><p> “You’re too good for me, sweetheart.”</p><p> “Too good!” said his wife. “You!1”</p><p> The amazement she felt was expressed in</p><p>her voice. She, too good for him! After </p><p>what he had done and suffered for his </p><p>country! </p><p> “Alan,” she said softly, “what is it,</p><p>dearest? Old boy, sometimes I wonder if </p><p>you really understand how much you mean </p><p>to me. You’re everything I’ve got; every- </p><p>thing. When you were out in France, </p><p>fighting bravely, suffering all those hard- </p><p>ships, I nearly died. I don’t know now, </p><p>dearest, how I lived through all those </p><p>months of waiting. It was agony. Any </p><p>day I might have heard what I dreaded. </p><p>At any moment when I was safe at home, </p><p>asleep, at dinner, shopping, you, my hus- </p><p>band, might have been lying dead. </p><p> “I used to find myself thinking: ‘Where</p><p>is he now? What is he doing? Is he in </p><p>battle?’ And I would feel that my heart </p><p>was breaking. It didn’t matter where I </p><p>was or with whom. And, Alan, I couldn’t </p><p>cry. I wasn’t able to—not then. I suf- </p><p>fered too much.” </p><p> She hesitated, smiling a little, her eyes</p><p>soft with tears. </p><p> “I thought I’d tell you, old boy, to let</p><p>you know what you mean to me. If you </p><p>had been killed, I’d have died. Life </p><p>wouldn’t have been worth living any longer. </p><p>I’m not brave, dear. And I was so proud </p><p>of you, dearest, so awfully proud of what </p><p>you did. It isn’t—isn’t every woman that </p><p>has a hero for a husband. It makes it </p><p>worse, doesn’t it, me, being such a coward?” </p><p>Kenyon felt that he was choking. </p><p> “A coward!” he muttered. “No, love,</p><p>not that! You’re no coward, love. My </p><p>God! And I never knew—never. And </p><p>you think I’m brave! You say you’re </p><p>proud of me! Doris, you’re wrong—you’ve </p><p>been wrong ah along. Oh, my God! I </p><p>wish—I wish-” </p><p> A longing to confess, to have her share</p><p>his secret, surged over him. But he knew </p><p>in his heart it would never be. Though </p><p>the whole world should learn the truth, his</p><p>wife must never know. He must keep his </p><p>secret, hard though it might be. </p><p>HE SHIVERED and glanced once </p><p>more over his shoulder into the </p><p>purple shadows, afraid lest down </p><p>the path between the tall dark hedges there </p><p>might come stealing after him. . . . </p><p> His wife put her hands on his arms. In</p><p>her voice was a sudden note of fear. </p><p> “Alan, what is it, love? Why are you</p><p>looking like that? Hadn’t you better come </p><p>in? It’s—it’s getting a bit chilly.” </p><p> “I’m not—not quite myself sometimes,”</p><p>he said hoarsely. “It’s—” he found the lie </p><p>ready to his lips, “it’s those shells. I keep </p><p>thinking every minute-” </p><p> “I understand. I know what it must</p><p>have been, dear.” </p><p> “I’m not fit to be your husband, Doris.</p><p>I’m—I’m a wreck, now; good for nothing— </p><p>good for nothing at all. I’m sorry for your </p><p>sake, dear, but I can’t help it. I wish I </p><p>In the Dug-Out </p><p>131 </p><p>4 </p><p>could. My soldiering’s finished, and I’m </p><p>not wanted—I’m scrapped. They won’t </p><p>send me out again—they know what I am. </p><p>I’m not all that you think I am, Doris. </p><p>Will you forgive me?” </p><p> She looked at him with a wistful ex-</p><p>pression. There was something he was </p><p>hiding from her, some secret that was hers </p><p>by right to share. He was in trouble, yet </p><p>he dared not tell her what was wrong. </p><p>That he, her husband, once so proud, so </p><p>self-reliant, he, this quiet man with the </p><p>lines of suffering in his face, could have </p><p>been so brave in battle, and then, broken </p><p>in health and spirit, could have come to her </p><p>beseeching her pardon for what he had not </p><p>done, was past all understanding. She felt </p><p>strangely humble, yet glad to think that </p><p>in spite of all he needed her. </p><p> “Alan, there’s something wrong, I know.</p><p>Why won’t you tell me? Can’t you trust </p><p>me, love?” </p><p> And, as she watched him, she felt sud-</p><p>denly that the love she bore him was like a </p><p>mother’s love toward her little son. He </p><p>was in trouble and in need of comfort. </p><p>Was not that sufficient? , </p><p> He had drawn back and was staring at her</p><p>with the weary look she knew so well. </p><p> “Can’t you tell me?” she repeated.</p><p>“Why not?” </p><p> All thought of denial had vanished. She</p><p>had said that something was wrong. Could </p><p>he deny it? And yet he dared not tell. </p><p>His pride had sealed his lips. Coward </p><p>though he might be, to her he must be a </p><p>hero until his dying day. </p><p> “No,” he said, “I can’t tell you, dearest.”</p><p>And then something came rustling </p><p>through the hedge, some animal. Kenyon </p><p>uttered a hoarse cry of fear as a rat brushed </p><p>against his leg and vanished headlong into </p><p>the shadows. </p><p> “My God—it’s found me. Doris—did</p><p>you see? Doris, it’s found me.”</p><p> He shivered with terror, uncontrollable.</p><p>“Alan, what is it? Alan, dear, don’t </p><p>look like that, for pity’s sake!” </p><p> The pressure of her hands on his steadied</p><p>him and gave him strength. The love and </p><p>pity in her eyes urged him to speak. </p><p> “I killed it,” he said. “Yes, I did kill it,</p><p>I remember now—in the dug-out. I must </p><p>be mad, because if I killed it, then it can’t </p><p>—•” Some thread seemed to snap and he </p><p>broke off abruptly. “Did I frighten you, </p><p>dearest? You understand now, though, </p><p>don’t you? I’m a coward, afraid of rats.” </p><p>And then speaking in a low, monotonous </p><p>voice, he told his story, hiding nothing, </p><p>excusing nothing; he told of the dug-out </p><p>and the explosion, his fight with the rats, </p><p>his fear and O’Hara’s death. </p><p> “I’m a broken man. I’ll never be any</p><p>use again. They said it was shell-shock. </p><p>But it isn’t. God, no! It’s just that I’m </p><p>afraid of rats. That’s all, nothing but rats. </p><p>I’d rather die a hundred deaths, I’d suffer </p><p>anything, rather than face them again. </p><p>It’s true, Doris, I would. And they called </p><p>me brave! Me! Why, Doris, I’m as big </p><p>a coward as ever walked this earth! </p><p> “Do you know that I’m saying now what</p><p>I thought I never could say—even to you? </p><p>Do you wonder that I’m miserable and </p><p>unhappy? Could I be anything else? I’ve </p><p>lost everything; my pride, my manhood, </p><p>and now—now, that you know, I’ve lost </p><p>you. How could you bear me any respect </p><p>after—after what I told you?” </p><p> The bitterness with which he ended</p><p>brought the tears to her eyes. </p><p> “You’re my husband,” she said and she</p><p>smiled tenderly. “Is not that sufficient? </p><p>Need I say more than that? Alan, you’ve </p><p>told me your secret, now I’ll tell you mine.” </p><p>“Yes,” he said wearily. “Yes, dear.” </p><p>“Darling, I loved you when you were </p><p>strong and well and had little real need of </p><p>me, you know that, don’t you? But, Alan, </p><p>I was always a little afraid of you, you were </p><p>so clever! I loved you still more when you </p><p>were far away in France, and I read all that </p><p>you’d done and how brave you were, but it </p><p>frightened me when I thought of the differ-</p><p>ence between us. But, dearest, now that </p><p>you’ve come back to me, tired and worn </p><p>out and ill, now that you’ve told me what </p><p>you’ve suffered, I love you more than ever </p><p>I did—and I think—I think you’re the </p><p>bravest man I ever heard of.” </p><p> He stared at her in dumb amazement.</p><p>Had she not understood what he had said, </p><p>or must he put things even more plainly? </p><p>He had made it clear that he was a coward, </p><p>yet she still loved him! It was impossible, </p><p>of course. How could she love a man who </p><p>was afraid, not of shells, but of rats? </p><p> Then, with the same tender smile on her</p><p>lips and her eyes shining, she put her hands </p><p>on his shoulders and kissed him proudly. </p><p> “You’re mine, Alan, and that’s enough.</p><p>Come, dear, it’s getting dark. We’ll go </p><p>indoors.” </p><p>RLD JT1CKJ </p><p>Author of “A New Keeper of the Wampum," "The Raven Mocker,” etc. </p><p>HlHE red news of St. Clair’s </p><p>defeat on the Wabash was being </p><p>carried by the triumphant </p><p>■	Miami along the Maumee to</p><p>the east, and south to the Ohio. Little </p><p>Turtle, whose fathers kindled the first fires </p><p>at Detroit, had counted his second great </p><p>coup over the whites. His defeat of </p><p>General Harmar on the Maumee the pre- </p><p>ceding Fall, however, was not to be com- </p><p>pared with this terrific punishment of St. </p><p>Clair’s army. And through the desolate </p><p>November forests sped the exulting mes- </p><p>sengers chosen “to carry the red.” The </p><p>Miami were noted for swiftness of foot, </p><p>and the red news radiated rapidly. Chicka- </p><p>saw and Cherokee, south of the Kentucky </p><p>wedge of civilization separating them from </p><p>their Northern brothers, would take heart </p><p>again and forget old feuds in a common </p><p>assault on the white settlements. Once </p><p>the red sticks proclaimed the great victory </p><p>to the Eastern tribes old hopes would </p><p>blaze up. </p><p> Abreast of the red sticks raced the lean</p><p>and lanky Kentucky scout, Joe Bund, </p><p>striving to outstrip the red death and warn </p><p>the settlements and lonely cabins along the </p><p>Ohio that hell was loosed, that the son of </p><p>a Miami chief and a Mohican mother was </p><p>reaching his tomahawk over the fair </p><p>country. </p><p> The Miami called Bund the Eagle,</p><p>Kendawa. He had lost precious time by </p><p>sticking to the fighting till the retreat </p><p>sounded and became a ghastly rout. It </p><p>was midday of that fateful November </p><p>fourth before he drew clear of the ruck of </p><p>fugitives. And even then, although real- </p><p>izing many lives depended upon his fleet </p><p>132 </p><p>Red Sticks </p><p>133 </p><p>feet, he had tarried to answer some pitiful </p><p>call for help where some lone soldier was </p><p>dying slowly. He knew he should have </p><p>stolen away in the first gray hour of fighting, </p><p>before selected bands of Miami warriors </p><p>could be dispatched for surprise attacks. </p><p>But he was human and he had lingered </p><p>till every vestige of hope was gone. As a </p><p>result he was not the first to leave the </p><p>stricken field. </p><p> All about him the silent woods were</p><p>sprinkled with the swift-stealing enemy, </p><p>and he could only hope there were none </p><p>directly ahead. That some had passed </p><p>his way was made evident by the bodies </p><p>of the slain militiamen he occasionally came </p><p>upon. These poor devils had fled at the </p><p>first assault only to be overtaken. If a </p><p>few won clear to spread the alarm their </p><p>cowardice was partly atoned for. </p><p> For weapons the scout retained his knife</p><p>and war-ax; for sustenance, a pouch of </p><p>parched corn which he munched as he ran. </p><p>For hours he sped through the interminable </p><p>forest before coming to a settlement. This </p><p>consisted of half a dozen new cabins on </p><p>Stillwater Creek, erected a few months </p><p>before when it was believed that St. </p><p>Clair’s expedition would make the country </p><p>safe. </p><p> He groaned in deep relief as a tall man,</p><p>Kentucky rifle in hand, emerged from the </p><p>nearest cabin. He had feared the Indians </p><p>had made the creek ahead of him. The </p><p>settler 011 recognizing the forest dress of </p><p>the scout dipped up a gourd of water from </p><p>a pail and ran forward to meet the runner, </p><p>his eyes lighting wildly. A woman ap- </p><p>peared in the doorway behind him, her face </p><p>strained and white, two children clinging </p><p>to her skirts. </p><p> “Sainclair’s licked ter hell!” were Bund’s</p><p>first words. “Been afeerd I’d git here too </p><p>late. The Injuns are on both sides of ye </p><p>but I reckon the path due south is open. </p><p>Tell yer neighbors! Strike for the Ohio! </p><p>Little Turtle’ll be swarmin’ down this crick </p><p>in no time.” </p><p> The man stared stupidly; the woman</p><p>reacted instantly. Uttering a sharp com-</p><p>mand to the children she darted back </p><p>into the cabin to make up some light packs. </p><p>The children ran to the other cabins shrilly </p><p>shrieking— </p><p> “Injuns! Injuns!”</p><p> The man shivered and nervously exam-</p><p>ined his rifle and glared apprehensively </p><p>toward the forest wall of naked branches. </p><p> “Thought Sainclair was goin’ to give</p><p>’em their needin’s,” he muttered as the </p><p>scout leaned against a stump, pumping for </p><p>breath. </p><p> Bund held out the gourd and while the</p><p>settler’s shaking hand was filling it he </p><p>rapidly informed: </p><p> “Everything done wrong. Harmar told</p><p>him he was in for a lickin’. I told him the </p><p>same thing when he lost so much time at </p><p>this very crick. Why, afore we left here </p><p>the six-months’ men was bleatin’ to go </p><p>home. He never oughter took any six- </p><p>months’ men for Injun fightin’. Right </p><p>after we quit here the bread give out. </p><p>Week afore we struck the river plain near </p><p>St. Mary’s some- of the militia deserted. </p><p>Colonel Hamtranck’s first regiment o’ </p><p>reg’lars—our best troops—was sent after </p><p>’em. </p><p> “Then we was outfitted poor. Lots o’</p><p>guns was no good an’ some of the powder </p><p>would scarcely burn. Sainclair wasl so </p><p>sick he couldn’t git on his hoss without </p><p>help. I was out on a scout when the army </p><p>struck the Wabash and camped. That </p><p>was night |afore last. And Sainclair didn’t </p><p>have any guides worth shucks, and they </p><p>didn’t even know they’d reached the </p><p>Wabash. Think o’ that! I got back </p><p>yesterday mornin’ when it was still cold </p><p>and dark, and was makin’ my report to </p><p>Major Ouldham—they got him—when the </p><p>devils jumped us, more’n a thousand of </p><p>’em, Little Turtle in command. General </p><p>Butler was killed-” </p><p> ‘ ‘ Gawd! One of our best officers, ” gasped</p><p>the settler. </p><p> “He had lots of comp’ny,” grimly assured</p><p>Bund, tightening his belt. “Inside 0’ four </p><p>hours we dropped nine hundred men in a</p><p>patch no bigger’n ten acres. For miles </p><p>the woods is plastered with everything </p><p>a scared man can heave away. Means hell </p><p>for the Ohio. The heathen’s carryin’ the </p><p>red sticks to the Alleghany and Kentucky. </p><p>Better help yer woman hurry up a bit. </p><p>I’m off.” </p><p> He darted away just in time to escape</p><p>a dozen men and women running forward </p><p>to question him. Although young in years </p><p>he was a veteran in border craft. He could </p><p>not understand how commanders could </p><p>proceed as had Harmar and St. Clair. </p><p>He wondered if the lesson would ever be </p><p>learned. The Braddock massacre on the </p><p>134 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Monongahela had taught military leaders </p><p>nothing, it would seem. </p><p> He had served with the Harmar ex-</p><p>pedition when the Miami villages at the </p><p>head of the Maumee were destroyed. At </p><p>that time he believed he followed a leader </p><p>who knew how to fight. Then he had seen </p><p>the militia colonel’s rash lust for battle </p><p>override Harmar’s judgment, with the men </p><p>rushing into two deadly ambuscades. That </p><p>experience and this overwhelming defeat </p><p>of St. Clair sickened him with the con- </p><p>viction that the Ohio country was now </p><p>closed to settlers for many years. </p><p> Light as a shadow he threaded the forest,</p><p>skirted marshes, and crossed unnamed </p><p>streams on driftwood or by swimming the </p><p>icy waters, his gaze ever seeking a pioneer’s </p><p>smoke. All about him were speeding the </p><p>red sticks. At any moment he might </p><p>encounter the van of the raiders, for several </p><p>bands had left the river ahead of him. </p><p>Within another twenty-four hours the </p><p>whole Ohio country, from the river to the </p><p>great lakes, would be blazing with triumph- </p><p>ant council fires. And he shuddered as he </p><p>thought of those not fortunate enough to </p><p>die in battle. </p><p>IT WAS on the edge of evening— </p><p>and he had run like a machine since </p><p>warning the Stillwater Creek settle- </p><p>ment—that he came to halt. He had </p><p>barely pushed back his light fur cap when </p><p>an arrow clipped through his left arm and </p><p>pinned it to his deerskin hunting shirt. </p><p>He dropped behind a black walnut in- </p><p>stantly, and his assailant sounded a yell </p><p>of triumph and leaped from cover. With </p><p>the resilience of tempered steel the scout </p><p>sprang to his feet, his right arm whipping </p><p>back and then forward; and the Miami </p><p>went down with the war-ax buried in his </p><p>forehead. </p><p> Without pausing to recover his ax Bund</p><p>resumed his flight, breaking off the arrow- </p><p>head and withdrawing the shaft as he ran. </p><p>With his teeth and free fingers he bandaged </p><p>the wound and fashioned a sling of rawhide </p><p>thong. </p><p> “I’ll be cussed if I ain’t fetched up with</p><p>’em. Pretty good runnin’, and they havin’ </p><p>hours’ start o’ me. Little Turtle started </p><p>’em south the minute he see he was winnin’. </p><p>Now to break through and take the lead. </p><p>Reckon that cuss’s war-whoop is drawin’ </p><p>’em in on me from all directions.” </p><p> That this conclusion was warranted</p><p>was shown by a shrill, ululating call in the </p><p>west. More ominous was the answering </p><p>signal on the scout’s left, for it was closer </p><p>at hand. The gathering darkness short- </p><p>ened his line of vision and forced him to </p><p>lessen his pace. The war-cry of the warrior </p><p>he had slain was drawing the savages in to </p><p>investigate why he did not answer their </p><p>signals. </p><p> Now that finesse must take the place of</p><p>speed Bund halted and arranged the sling </p><p>about his wounded arm and briefly pon- </p><p>dered over his predicament. The advance </p><p>guard of victorious warriors, shrewdly </p><p>rushed toward the Ohio by Little Turtle </p><p>instead of being allowed to tarry for the </p><p>terrible scenes following the massacre, was </p><p>well abreast if not entirely surrounding him. </p><p>These would be picked warriors, traveling </p><p>fast and furious to prevent fugitives from </p><p>warning the river settlements. </p><p> The scout had lost some four hours by</p><p>remaining to fight the rear-guard action. </p><p>The dead Indian’s war-cry had advertised </p><p>the discovery of a victim; his failure to </p><p>sound the scalp-halloo had told the rest </p><p>of the story. </p><p> “They know he’s wiped out, and now</p><p>they’ll try to bottle me up,” Bund told </p><p>himself as he felt his way with his feet </p><p>through a dark grove. “Reckon I’m a </p><p>mighty poor Eagle—reckon Sainclair’s </p><p>lickin’ will send this neck o’ the woods to </p><p>the devil a-flyin’.” </p><p> The black growth gave way tc an opening</p><p>as Bund discovered by the sudden re- </p><p>appearance of stars in the frosty heavens. </p><p>He crouched warily and cursed his ill-luck. </p><p>The opening was an additional handicap. </p><p>To make a detour would cost precious time </p><p>and probably throw him into the clutches </p><p>of the Miami. To advance was to discard </p><p>his last defense—secrecy—providing the </p><p>warriors in the rear should be close at hand. </p><p>And he believed they were. </p><p> A sharp yelp on his right, quickly</p><p>answered by a similar signal on his left, </p><p>forced his decision. But what put new life </p><p>into his heels was the repetition of the call </p><p>a short distance behind him. Without </p><p>hesitating longer he scudded into the </p><p>opening. </p><p> He had covered only a few rods when he</p><p>struck a patch of corn, and his heart quailed </p><p>in anguish. Corn meant a cabin, and a </p><p>cabin with the Miami already upon it. </p><p>Red Sticks </p><p>135 </p><p> “I’ll be cussed if they don’t have their</p><p>chance, such as it is,” he grunted, dropping </p><p>to his knees to locate the squat outlines </p><p>against the skyline. </p><p> There it stood, black and silent, an</p><p>outpost of the white man’s hunger for home </p><p>and land, symbolic of the whole bloody </p><p>business of remaking a continent. Hordes </p><p>of adventurers had come and gone up and </p><p>down the Ohio and Mississippi without </p><p>leaving a trace, except as rusty bits of war- </p><p>harness and broken bones were sometimes </p><p>found in the forest mold. But such wan- </p><p>derers had come for gold and their impress </p><p>on the country was as transitory as the </p><p>trails their feel had made. </p><p> This small structure of laboriously hewn</p><p>logs spelled permanency, something to be </p><p>defended and fought for. And, God! What </p><p>dismay would his message bring to many </p><p>such humble habitations were he spared to </p><p>continue his mission. </p><p> He ran to the door and his flesh crawled</p><p>when he found it wide open. Falling on </p><p>his knees he swept his free hand over the </p><p>floor of hard-packed earth. </p><p> “There ain’t no one here,” he whispered,</p><p>his dread of finding silent forms dropping </p><p>from him. “Thank God! Some o’ the </p><p>deserters got through and fetched the </p><p>word.” </p><p> Now that he was in the cabin he became</p><p>conscious of an awful thirst. It seemed </p><p>as though his lungs would burst if he did </p><p>not find water. He located a gourd but </p><p>it was empty. There was a kettle in the </p><p>fireplace, also empty. By the feel of the </p><p>ashes he knew the fire had died out a good </p><p>twelve hours back. The occupants prob- </p><p>ably had fled early that morning, warned </p><p>by soldiers who had deserted the night </p><p>before the battle. Next his exploring hand </p><p>fell upon a tiny moccasin, and he knew </p><p>frantic parents were being handicapped in </p><p>their flight by a little child. With peculiar </p><p>persistency for detail his mind instantly </p><p>decided the child was a girl. </p><p> But of drink there was nothing. He</p><p>straightened and bumped his head on a</p><p>rough shelf. His right hand flew to it at </p><p>once and he grunted softly as his fingers </p><p>closed about a small, wide-necked bottle. </p><p> Hungrily tearing off the birch-bark cover</p><p>with his teeth he was rewarded by a faint </p><p>aroma of whisky. He tipped the bottle </p><p>eagerly but his lips remained dry. He was </p><p>puzzled as well as disappointed. The bottle </p><p>was partly filled with something that </p><p>smelled of whisky. He shook it gently </p><p>and felt its contents move. Despite his </p><p>desperate situation he took time to place </p><p>the bottle on the floor and insert two </p><p>fingers. He drew forth some kind of fruit. </p><p>Placing it in his mouth he chewed it </p><p>ecstatically, murmuring—“Wild cherries </p><p>put up in whisky, only the whisky’s most </p><p>gone.” </p><p> He hastily placed several more of the</p><p>little cherries in his mouth, intending to </p><p>finish the bottle, when a soft movement </p><p>outside the cabin warned him he had </p><p>tarried too long. To the untrained ear it </p><p>might have been the beating of a night </p><p>bird’s wing, or the almost inaudible foot- </p><p>fall of a wolf. But Bund interpreted it </p><p>correctly. Hastily tipping the bottle up- </p><p>side down in his palm he caught the pre- </p><p>served fruit and dropped it into a pocket </p><p>of his hunting shirt. Then he drew his </p><p>knife and stepped to the door. </p><p> A low signal rippled ’round the opening,</p><p>telling him the cabin was inside the circle. </p><p>One or more savages had come to investigate </p><p>the small building. The scout stepped to </p><p>the left of the door so that his knife-hand </p><p>might have free play, and waited. </p><p> There was no further sound but he soon</p><p>discerned a dark object on a level with his </p><p>eyes and within a foot of him. A warrior </p><p>had thrust his head over the threshold. </p><p>The scout detected his suppressed breath- </p><p>ing. , Motionless and holding his own </p><p>breath he drew back the knife, hoping the </p><p>savage would withdraw and report the place </p><p>deserted. The warrior made a guttural </p><p>sound and began sniffing curiously. </p><p> Bund immediately guessed the truth.</p><p>The Miami had caught the scent of the </p><p>preserved fruit and the faint odor of </p><p>whisky. He grunted joyously and stepped </p><p>over the threshold his right hand falling</p><p>on Bund’s face. He essayed to leap back, </p><p>a shriek of warning pealing from his lips, </p><p>but Bund lunged fiercely. The savage </p><p>went to his knees, the knife buried in his </p><p>throat. Over the writhing body leaped </p><p>the scout only to run into the arms of </p><p>several Indians. </p><p> The shouts of triumph quickly changed</p><p>to the death-cry as the Miami stumbled </p><p>over the body of the dead savage. A fire </p><p>sprang up as if by magic, and by its </p><p>flare Bund read a fearful purpose in the </p><p>ferociously painted faces. </p><p>136 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Kendawal” exulted one of his captors,</p><p>seizing liis right hand and holding it over a </p><p>blazing roll of birch bark. </p><p> “Yes, yer dog!” gritted Bund and making</p><p>no effort to release his hand, but showing </p><p>his contempt by spitting a cherry into the </p><p>face of his torturer. </p><p> Then in the Miami dialect:</p><p> “If your chief’s mother hadn’t been a</p><p>Mohican you’d be running toward the </p><p>setting sun today. Miami men are old </p><p>women. You are fleet of foot as the ante- </p><p>lope because you’ve been chased from your </p><p>hunting grounds by Potawatomi, Kickapoo, </p><p>Shawnee, and every other tribe that’s </p><p>wanted your land. You have run away so </p><p>much-” </p><p> He ceased his harangue to gape in amaze-</p><p>ment. The burning bark had been removed </p><p>from his hand before it could do any harm, </p><p>and his captors were ignoring him to stare </p><p>at something held in the palm of his torturer. </p><p> It was the preserved cherry, tiny and</p><p>firm and round and red. Its effect had </p><p>been more striking than a bullet. The </p><p>circle of morose faces were glaring at it </p><p>incredulously. At last the savage holding </p><p>it gingerly raised it to his nose and sniffed; </p><p>then placed it in his mouth. The circle </p><p>grunted and waited for his decision. </p><p> “A fresh, ripe cherry,” he announced,</p><p>licking his lips over the suggestion of </p><p>whisky accompanying the fruit. </p><p> Bund, who had only hoped his raillery</p><p>would bring a merciful death by tomahawk </p><p>or knife, now understood that the cherry </p><p>was a miracle to them. Taking advantage </p><p>of the flickering light and the absorbed </p><p>attention of his captors he managed to fish </p><p>out two of the tiny fruit and pass them to </p><p>his mouth unnoticed. </p><p> “An evil spirit whispers to Papakeecha,”</p><p>protested a warrior. “Cherries have not </p><p>ripened for many moons. Snow is on the </p><p>way. Do flowers grow in Winter? Do </p><p>birds mate after the leaves fall? There are</p><p>no ripe cherries.” </p><p> Bund broke in:</p><p> “Flat Belly has heard no evil spirit. He</p><p>has seen the magic of Kendawa, whose </p><p>manito is mighty.” </p><p> “The Eagle flies over the ground, but is</p><p>he a magician?” demanded the skeptic. </p><p> “The white man’s manito works when he</p><p>is needed. Kendawa is a magician,” re- </p><p>plied Bund; and he expelled a cherry into </p><p>the face of the last speaker. </p><p> The skeptic caught the fruit and held it</p><p>close to the flaming bark to study it. He </p><p>found it a bright red reminder of early </p><p>Summer. There was no questioning its </p><p>appearance. To make certain the savage </p><p>delicately split it with his knife and dis- </p><p>closed the pit. As a final test he plopped </p><p>it into his mouth. The others watched </p><p>him with breathless interest and observed </p><p>he nodded with grim enjoyment as his </p><p>palate was tickled by the suggestion of </p><p>fire-water, and was soothed by the piquancy </p><p>of the tart fruit, doubly delectable now </p><p>Winter was swinging down from the </p><p>North. </p><p> “Prob’ly the first redskins to taste a wild</p><p>cherry out of season,” thought Bund. </p><p> “Kendawa’s manito is mighty,” conceded</p><p>the warrior after swallowing the cherry. </p><p>“We have only known him as one who runs </p><p>swiftly. Now he is a magician, he shall </p><p>show his magic to Michikinikwa.” </p><p> The scout grew cold. He had no desire</p><p>to face Little Turtle, who had won highest </p><p>place among the Miami despite the fact </p><p>his father’s rank had helped him none. </p><p>For, by the Indian rule of the Miami of </p><p>tracing ancestry through the mother, he </p><p>was a Mohican. He had gained place and </p><p>fame while young because of his unusual </p><p>merits. To impose on such would require </p><p>the utmost nerve and finesse. </p><p> “He shall escape the torture so long as</p><p>he spits ripe cherries,” declared Flat Belly. </p><p> Bund winced. If not discovered his</p><p>stock of cherries could not exceed more </p><p>than forty or fifty, he estimated. If found</p><p>upon him the miracle would lose nothing </p><p>by the discovery, but he would be com- </p><p>manded to instantly refill the pocket. </p><p> “Let him spit more cherries now,” urged</p><p>a savage, whose wrinkled nostrils evidenced </p><p>he had caught the subtle scent of the </p><p>preservative. </p><p> “Kendawa’s manito works not at the</p><p>word of a Miami squaw,” haughtily </p><p>informed Bund. </p><p> The savage caught his right hand and</p><p>closed hi^ teeth on a finger, intending to </p><p>bite off a nail, but Flat Belly took umbrage </p><p>and pulled him back, reminding: </p><p> “He is my prisoner. Mine was the first</p><p>hand to touch him.” </p><p> By this time warriors were pouring in</p><p>from the forest, the word having been </p><p>passed that a mighty white magician had </p><p>been captured; a man who held the seasons </p><p>Red Sticks </p><p>137 </p><p>in his mouth and could spit ripe fruit when- </p><p>ever he would, although it be the moon of </p><p>honking geese. Flat Belly quickly ob- </p><p>served he was an object of unusual im- </p><p>portance among his brothers. </p><p> To possess a captive whose manito con-</p><p>trolled the seasons was a unique dis- </p><p>tinction. His was the first hand to fall </p><p>on the scout as he leaped through the </p><p>doorway. Not even Little Turtle could </p><p>take his prisoner from him without up- </p><p>setting Indian etiquette and usage. Various </p><p>warriors now began bidding for the scout, </p><p>eagerly offering their fresh scalps, their </p><p>shares of coats, powder-horns and rifles </p><p>gathered from the rout. </p><p> But all these tilings Flat Belly could</p><p>secure for himself any time, now the </p><p>red man was to conquer the white race. </p><p>Twice already Little Turtle had furnished </p><p>the Miami with rare pickings. But only </p><p>the gods sent prisoners who could spit ripe </p><p>cherries on the brink of Winter and em- </p><p>broider the gift with the aroma of Penn- </p><p>sylvania whisky. To Bund’s great relief </p><p>Flat Belly scorned all offers. Tying the </p><p>scout’s hand behind his back and placing </p><p>a slip-noose about his neck the Indian drove </p><p>him into the forest, making north. </p><p> Bund’s veins grew hot with hope; not</p><p>for himself but for the settlements along </p><p>the Ohio. His capture had halted the ad- </p><p>vance of the enemy; for he was satisfied </p><p>every member of the scouting party within </p><p>reach of the tremendous news a white </p><p>magician had been captured was following </p><p>him and his proud captor. It was char- </p><p>acteristic of the Indian mind to become </p><p>unmindful of the war party’s original </p><p>purpose in hastening south. </p><p> “I’ll be cussed if they can do any more’n</p><p>burn me,” he grimly decided. “Mebbe </p><p>it’s better I’m caught. I might ’a’ led ’em </p><p>full-bent on to the little gal and her folks. </p><p>They have a extry chance to make the Ohio </p><p>and they’ll carry the word of alarm as well </p><p>as me. What with ’em and the deserters </p><p>who warned ’em the settlers oughter have </p><p>time to cross into Kentucky.” </p><p>LITTLE TURTLE was exceedingly</p><p>wroth with his warriors because of </p><p>their failure to push on to the </p><p>Beautiful River. His anger was tempered </p><p>somewhat when he learned their reason </p><p>for hastening back. They had captured a </p><p>white magician whose manito allowed him </p><p>to transpose the seasons. He could make </p><p>ripe cherries to come back when he would </p><p>and the grass to grow green and lush </p><p>though it be deep Winter. </p><p> He could provide pasturage for the buffalo</p><p>the year ’round and stop their wandering </p><p>far South in search of feed. Surely none </p><p>but the Miami ever had captured such a </p><p>prisoner. To be sure he was the personal </p><p>property of Flat Belly, but his works must </p><p>redound to the advantage and advancement </p><p>of the entire Miami people. </p><p> Little Turtle did not believe these</p><p>fantastic rumors, yet his curiosity was </p><p>sharply aroused. </p><p> “Bring the white man to me,” he com-</p><p>manded. </p><p> Flat Belly proudly led forth his captive,</p><p>after removing the ropes from his neck and </p><p>hand. Bund stood composed of bearing </p><p>in the middle of the wide circle of interested </p><p>warriors, his wounded arm hanging at his </p><p>side, two fingers of the right hand being </p><p>hooked in the pocket of his hunting shirt. </p><p>Little Turtle was disappointed and harshly </p><p>demanded: </p><p> “What is he called? He is not even a</p><p>chief. I saw him fighting among the </p><p>soldiers.” </p><p> “Kendawa,” spoke up Bund.</p><p> “So Michikinikwa has caught an Eagle,”</p><p>sneered the chief. “The others were clumsy </p><p>game.” And he paused to allow his proud </p><p>gaze to range over the heaps of plunder </p><p>awaiting distribution. “Michikinikwa has </p><p>heard the eagle makes medicine.” </p><p> Ignoring the irony in the chief’s tone</p><p>Bund gravely assured: </p><p> “Straight tongues have spoken to Mich-</p><p>ikinikwa. The manito of the Eagle is </p><p>very strong.” </p><p> “But the words fell strange on Mich-</p><p>ikinikwa’s ears, for they spoke of magic </p><p>that tosses the seasons back and forth </p><p>like pebbles in the hand of a child.” </p><p> “They were true words,” haughtily de-</p><p>clared Bund, now nerved to play his r61e to </p><p>the limit. </p><p> “And yet this mighty manito of the white</p><p>man did not help him to escape the Miami,” </p><p>reminded the chief. </p><p> “His capture brought back Michikini-</p><p>kwa’s warriors. His manito willed that </p><p>one should be taken that many might </p><p>escape,” countered the scout, palming two </p><p>cherries before allowing his right hand to </p><p>drop at his side. </p><p>138 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Little Turtle’s face for a moment</p><p>grimaced with fury as he realized the </p><p>truth of this. But his voice was gentle as </p><p>he continued: </p><p> “It is said the white man’s magic can</p><p>make the pawpaw and black walnut put </p><p>forth new leaves the year ’round.” </p><p> “Even that is easy for the manito of the</p><p>Eagle,” quietly declared Bund. </p><p> “When crooked tongues speak to Michi-</p><p>kinikwa he pulls them out by the roots,” </p><p>warned the chief, extending his sinewy </p><p>fingers suggestively. </p><p> “It is good,” said Bund.</p><p> He could feel the impact of the savage</p><p>gaze of the warriors massed behind him, </p><p>and, from the tail of his eye, observed the </p><p>rapt attention of those on either side of the </p><p>chief. All were rigid and silent as they </p><p>watched the unfolding of the drama. Nor </p><p>was there one who failed to realize that </p><p>Little Turtle was aroused to a mighty pitch </p><p>of fury at the calm bearing of the prisoner </p><p>and his colossal claims. And Bund knew </p><p>he must win out or suffer as no prisoner </p><p>of the Miami had yet suffered. </p><p> “Can Kendawa make corn grow?” Little</p><p>Turtle taunted. </p><p> “His manito can make corn grow now,”</p><p>readily answered Bund. </p><p> The circle of warriors moved uneasily.</p><p>A climax dearly to the liking of the red man </p><p>was at hand. In dramatic values it sur- </p><p>passed the stake. Nor was there lacking </p><p>frank admiration for the bold demeanor </p><p>of the scout. Even Little Turtle was im- </p><p>pelled to approve of a man who composedly </p><p>claimed so much. </p><p> “Will the Eagle’s manito make com grow</p><p>now?” he softly asked and leaned forward </p><p>to catch the answer. </p><p> Bund shrugged his shoulders and replied,</p><p>“Michikinikwa, of the Toonpaoh clan, </p><p>my manito is ready to tell you things of </p><p>much more importance than the growing of</p><p>corn.” </p><p> The use of the Mohican term for</p><p>“Turtle,” the clan of the chief, was a subtle </p><p>touch and did not fail to register an effect </p><p>on the chief. It betokened the white man’s </p><p>knowledge of his eventful and ambitious </p><p>history; it appealed to his pride that his </p><p>ancestry, through mother-right, should be </p><p>intimately known by his enemies. But no </p><p>flattery could cause him to overlook the </p><p>scout’s evasion, and his eyes lighted in </p><p>triumph. </p><p> Throwing off his air of restraint he sternly</p><p>commanded— </p><p> “Come, if you are a magician, make corn</p><p>grow.” </p><p> The encircling warriors hunched forward,</p><p>their eyes glistening. The fate of the white </p><p>man was ensconced within the next few </p><p>seconds. </p><p> “The corn is scarcely harvested. If the .</p><p>Eagle showed green com in his talons </p><p>Michikinikwa would say it was some trick. </p><p>Why should the mighty manito of Kendawa </p><p>do child’s play when its tongue is heavy with </p><p>grave words for the Miami?” was the scout’s </p><p>answer. </p><p> A deep sigh of disappointment at such a</p><p>tame conclusion rose from the spectators; </p><p>and in fierce triumph Little Turtle cried </p><p>out: </p><p> “Your tongue is crooked. Your manito</p><p>is an old man. He is very lame. He falls </p><p>down and can not get up. Papakeecha, </p><p>put this man to the torture.” </p><p> Bund turned aside his head as though to</p><p>show his contempt and stared away to </p><p>where the forest crown and leaden clouds </p><p>met. He had but one card to play and </p><p>he knew he must play it at the apex of the </p><p>situation. His knowledge of the Indian </p><p>character had warned him he must assert </p><p>the dignity and independence of his manito </p><p>before performing any works. And insofar </p><p>as Little Turtle ignored the tribal law con- </p><p>cerning the fate of prisoners, by so much </p><p>would he weaken himself to the correspond- </p><p>ing advantage of the captive. </p><p> “This man is a liar. Put him to the</p><p>torture at once, Papacheeka,” passionately </p><p>repeated the chief. </p><p> Bund whistled softly and continued</p><p>gazing at the somber sky. Flat Belly’s </p><p>face became convulsed with rage at the </p><p>command. The warriors moved about un- </p><p>easily. The white man was Flat Belly’s </p><p>prisoner, and although all envied him, yet </p><p>there was the law of the tribe. </p><p> “Michikinikwa is a mighty war chief</p><p>and his brothers are proud to follow him,” </p><p>rumbled Flat Belly. “But the white man </p><p>is my prisoner. If he makes corn grow, </p><p>Michikinikwa shall have the first ears—a </p><p>gift from Papakeecha. The white man is </p><p>my prisoner according to the law of the </p><p>Miami.” </p><p> His words met with low notes of approval.</p><p>A wild desire to bury his war-ax in the </p><p>stubborn Flat Belly’s head filled the heart </p><p>Red Sticks </p><p>139 </p><p>of Little Turtle, but he betrayed nothing </p><p>of his feeling. He held his high position </p><p>because of his ability to study situations </p><p>from all sides. He knew his leadership </p><p>would endure only so long as he was </p><p>successful. He could not compel the </p><p>service of any warriors. </p><p> The Indian fought when he chose and</p><p>under whom he chose, and did he tire of a </p><p>project he could abandon it at any time. A </p><p>warrior’s dream could disrupt an extensive </p><p>organization for offensive war. And a war- </p><p>chief without a following had no prestige. </p><p>Little Turtle always spoke of the Miami </p><p>people as “I,” but there were lengths to which </p><p>he could not go. </p><p> He inclined his head gravely as Flat</p><p>Belly finished, and then addressed Bund, </p><p>saying: </p><p> “Your manito has a message for me—the</p><p>Miami. After it is spoken perhaps he will </p><p>grow corn for me.” </p><p> “I bring a message to Michikinikwa,”</p><p>stoutly replied Bund, believing the first </p><p>crisis had passed. </p><p> “Speak, Kendawa; but we talk without</p><p>belts.” </p><p> The chief’s words were smoothly spoken,</p><p>but they contained the reminder he was </p><p>committing himself none as to his future </p><p>conduct. </p><p> “My manito bids me say to you, oh,</p><p>Michikinikwa, that the time draws near </p><p>when you will talk with peace belts to the </p><p>Thirteen Fires (the thirteen colonies) and </p><p>will be glad to do so.” </p><p> The boldness of this speech and its</p><p>insolence, in view of the unburied dead </p><p>along the Wabash, wrung little exclama- </p><p>tions of anger from the assembly. </p><p> “When I talk with the Thirteen Fires</p><p>they will accept my terms or die out,” </p><p>hissed Little Turtle, trembling with rage. </p><p>“It will take many snows to bury the </p><p>dead the white men have left along the </p><p>Wabash.”</p><p> “Yet you will carry to the Thirteen Fires</p><p>only the mnoti.” </p><p> “The Miami may carry the bag contain-</p><p>ing peace belts to the Thirteen Fires as </p><p>your lying manito says, but it will be only </p><p>after Kendawa’s magic has changed the </p><p>seasons back and forth, as some foolish </p><p>warriors seem to believe it can do,” was </p><p>the fierce retort. </p><p> Bund thrilled. He had worked the scene</p><p>up to the one climax that might save him </p><p>and had forced the chief to lead the way </p><p>throughout. Slowly swinging his gaze back </p><p>till it rested on Little Turtle’s fierce coun- </p><p>tenance he demanded: </p><p> “Michikinikwa speaks of the seasons</p><p>as though they were fixed in their places. </p><p>Cherries blossomed and ripened months </p><p>ago. Are there any ripe cherries now? </p><p>Can the Miami warriors go forth and bring </p><p>back ripe cherries to their war-chief?” As </p><p>he awaited an answer he folded his hands </p><p>before him, passing the preserved fruit into </p><p>his left. </p><p> “The wild geese fill the gray sky,”</p><p>sullenly replied the chief. “The beaver </p><p>has cut his wood for Winter. There are no </p><p>ripe cherries.” </p><p> As Little Turtle ceased speaking Bund</p><p>took a dramatic step forward and extended </p><p>his wounded arm, with the hand held </p><p>palm up. Little Turtle stared as though </p><p>hypnotized at the two ripe cherries thus </p><p>revealed. His startled eyes were raised </p><p>to meet the calm glance of the white man. </p><p>Very slowly, as though held back by </p><p>caution, he reached forth and gingerly took </p><p>the fruit and fingered it gently. </p><p> He was amazed to find it was genuine</p><p>to all appearances. He bit into one of the </p><p>cherries and examined the pit, while his </p><p>warriors held their breath. There were </p><p>clever Indian magicians, some very skilful </p><p>in legerdemain; but there was none who </p><p>could produce ripe cherries in November. </p><p>Little Turtle had watched them make </p><p>plants grow and flower and bear fruit, but </p><p>always in the shadows near some smoking </p><p>camp-fire, aided and abetted by their </p><p>blankets. And in all such instances plant,</p><p>fruit and flower were artificial and would </p><p>not bear investigation. </p><p> Although he was much more astute than</p><p>his followers he still was an Indian and </p><p>unable to doubt the evidence of his senses. </p><p>He had tasted one cherry and found it to be </p><p>genuine. He ate the other and enjoyed </p><p>the relish. </p><p> “What words has the great Michi-</p><p>kinikwa to say to the Eagle’s manito now?” </p><p>demanded the scout in a stentorian voice, </p><p>drawing himself haughtily erect and hooking </p><p>his hand into his hunting-shirt pocket. </p><p>“Which is greater medicine? To make </p><p>corn grow when the harvest season is just </p><p>over, or to bring the moon of cherries into </p><p>the moon of wild geese?” </p><p> Low murmurs of approval ran ’round</p><p>140 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the circle. Flat Belly’s magician had </p><p>vindicated his medicine. </p><p> Little Turtle slowly confessed—</p><p> “The manito of Kendawa is mighty.”</p><p>“Michikinikwa speaks wise words. It </p><p>is well. And remember, that as surely as </p><p>you have eaten ripe cherries when snow </p><p>is in the air, just so surely will you carry </p><p>peace belts to the Thirteen Fires.” </p><p> And with this forceful prophecy Bund</p><p>raised his right hand above his head and </p><p>scattered a shower of the fruit over Flat </p><p>Belly and the warriors about him. </p><p> The effect of this demonstration was over-</p><p>whelming. It left Little Turtle rigid and </p><p>voiceless. The warriors lost their reserve </p><p>and grunted loudly at the prodigality </p><p>of the Eagle’s manito. Flat Belly dropped </p><p>on his knees to gather up the fruit and </p><p>cram it into his slit of a mouth. </p><p>Greatly disturbed at the scout’s words </p><p>and at this further miracle Little Turtle, </p><p>on recovering his power of speech, directed: </p><p>“Papakeecha, take the white magician </p><p>away. His manito is mighty.” </p><p>IN ACCEPTING the command of </p><p>the third expedition against the </p><p>Miami and allied tribes General </p><p>Wayne, “Mad Anthony,” conferred much </p><p>with President Washington on Indian war- </p><p>fare and profited thereby. He refused </p><p>to accept six-months’ men, or any who </p><p>were not Americans. He gave special </p><p>attention to bayonet and broadsword drill </p><p>and refused to take the field till his legion </p><p>had been trained for two years for the </p><p>bloody work ahead. </p><p> But when he finally struck the combined</p><p>forces of the Indians on the Maumee he </p><p>smashed the confederacy within sixty </p><p>minutes of fighting, thereby cementing the </p><p>United States’ hold on the Northwest </p><p>Territory. Among the delegates from the </p><p>various Indian nations to confer with </p><p>General Wayne at Greenville in the Summer </p><p>of 1795 was the famous Little Turtle. </p><p> He spoke eloquently for the Miami and</p><p>was answered generously by Wayne. Ninety . </p><p>chiefs and delegates, representing twelve </p><p>tribes, signed the treaty, swearing perpetual </p><p>peace and placing their people under the pro- </p><p>tection of the United States. The success </p><p>of the lengthy conference was as great a </p><p>triumph as was the last battle on the </p><p>Maumee. Throughout the sessions Scout </p><p>Bund stood behind Wayne, serving as </p><p>interpreter. No signs of recognition passed </p><p>between him and Little Turtle. </p><p> But after the treaty was signed and</p><p>Little Turtle was about to return to his </p><p>people he halted before the scout and said: </p><p> “Kendawa’s manito is mighty. Michi-</p><p>kinikwa has brought peace belts to the </p><p>Thirteen Fires even as was said. Does </p><p>Kendawa still have ripe cherries out of </p><p>season?” </p><p> “Not since the young English officer</p><p>ransomed him for a keg of rum from </p><p>Papakeecha at Detroit. Now the peace </p><p>bag has been opened between Michikinikwa </p><p>and the Big Wind (Wayne) Kendawa’s </p><p>manito has no need for magic. Michi- </p><p>kinikwa is now my brother.” </p><p> “Michikinikwa salutes his brother, the</p><p>Eagle. I am the last to sign the peace </p><p>treaty and I will be the last to break it.” </p><p> With this sententious declaration he</p><p>strode into the forest. And history records </p><p>that his tongue was straight and that for </p><p>the remainder of his years he was faithful </p><p>to his new allegiance. </p><p>33353EB^* </p><p>A WARD </p><p>or THE </p><p>of TATE </p><p>Thoma j J. </p><p>Miller </p><p>Author of “The Show-Down," "The Trouble-Maker of Ibbo,” etc. </p><p>ILL WATKINS was deceptive; </p><p>soft of speech by reason of tuning </p><p>his tongue to the musical vowels </p><p>of the “greasers” and “dagoes” he </p><p>caressed with inoffensive oaths in the rock </p><p>pit of the cement mill in the Pescadero </p><p>Mountains, patient through long handling of </p><p>raw unskilled labor, and with blue, twink- </p><p>ling, honor eyes he passed at first sight for </p><p>“easy.” But Bill drew down a hundred and </p><p>fifty per, was in line for the superintendent’s </p><p>job at thirty-one, and had no weaknesses </p><p>worth the mention, unless it were a fondness </p><p>for poker, if it can be called a weakness in </p><p>one who played for the game. </p><p> “There are just three ways of digging up</p><p>the man within the man,” he was wont to </p><p>say. “One is to go and shut yourself up </p><p>with him twelve months in a cabin, which is </p><p>apt to be tedious; another is to get him so </p><p>full of licker that his guards drop away and </p><p>the man comes out naked, which ain’t </p><p>amusing; the third and best is to sit in with </p><p>him at poker.” </p><p> Bill’s hobby was to know men. Mrs.</p><p>Goodyear, the superintendent’s wife, lec- </p><p>tured him on his “gambling.” She was de- </p><p>ceived. Bill was no gambler. So was </p><p>Adolf Olsen deceived. Adolf ran a rake-off </p><p>game under police protection at his road- </p><p>house just across the Santa Cruz—San </p><p>Mateo county-line. Adolf was a big, big </p><p>Swede who thought he was wise. </p><p> When Bill off-saddled one Saturday even-</p><p>ing at his road-house and invited the gentry </p><p>lounging hopefully around to a “smile” </p><p>Adolf’s saucer-blue eyes took an inventory. </p><p>He inventoried corduroy pants with a lump </p><p>left pocket from which Bill carelessly fisted a </p><p>loose handful of gold and silver, an unbut- </p><p>toned vest held loosely over a flannel shirt </p><p>by a gold chain chunky enough to float a </p><p>liberty loan, a right top pocket bulging </p><p>with cigars and a left that did duty as </p><p>traveling toilet-bag, exposing a toothbrush,</p><p>razor, comb, lather-brush. </p><p> His hat was a soft wide-awake air-holed</p><p>with buckshot and completely encircled </p><p>141 </p><p>142 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>with red-cross badges at a dollar a throw. </p><p>Adolf was tagged with the Kanuri proverb, </p><p>“He sees with the eyes only,” meaning that </p><p>the gray stuff was not on the job; that he </p><p>was too easily fooled by mere appearances. </p><p>He saw a lamb come to the slaughter and </p><p>indulged an extensive grin that displayed </p><p>rock-crushing molars proportionate to the </p><p>rest of him. </p><p> “I didn’t get your name, party?” he in-</p><p>vited as he decorated the bar. </p><p> “Watkins—Bill. Here’s a go, boys.”</p><p> Adolf noted that Bill was very moderate</p><p>with the whisky bottle. Bill noted that </p><p>Adolf did not treat back. He stowed the </p><p>notation away and swept wistful eyes over a </p><p>green baize table. Adolf read the sign of </p><p>the times. Saturday night is synonymous </p><p>with payroll the long length and narrow </p><p>breadth of California. It was Adolf’s busi- </p><p>ness to divorce wages from their careless </p><p>owners. Telepathically Bill, Adolf, a logger </p><p>and an Italian artichoke-grower gravitated </p><p>to the table. </p><p> At 12 o’clock Adolf closed the bar and</p><p>continued the sessions in the house. It was </p><p>worth continuing, so blessedly goodnatur- </p><p>edly did Bill Watkins loose. For that mat- </p><p>ter Adolf would have been perfectly content </p><p>to continue the game for the dollar-per- </p><p>jack-pot rake-off to the house and the drink </p><p>orders. It was the drink orders that made </p><p>the first ripple in the serenity of the straw </p><p>boss. Bill fell foul of a distrustful habit </p><p>Adolf had of gathering up his money before </p><p>leaving the table to serve drinks. </p><p> “Nobody ain’t going to get away with</p><p>your pile, Olson,” he politely remonstrated. </p><p> “I don’t believe in laying temptation</p><p>around too promiscuous,” grinned Adolf, </p><p>but must have given the point considera- </p><p>tion, for he went to a door that opened on </p><p>stairs and bawled: </p><p> “Alice—Alice! Come down and ’tend</p><p>bar.” </p><p> Presently there appeared a girl with rebel-</p><p>lion stamped on her face and expressed in</p><p>the laggard movements of her strong, supple </p><p>body. Bill accepted the innovation with </p><p>patient displeasure, covertly eying, sizing </p><p>her up. Her face figured around seventeen, </p><p>but her body had the physical development </p><p>of a young woman. She could be no rela- </p><p>tion of Olsen, who was as blond as any </p><p>savage that came out of the land of the </p><p>Vikings; a brunette with close-cropped </p><p>chestnut hair, matching eyes that could be </p><p>saucy, if they had anything to be saucy </p><p>over, but were now sleepy and angry, a </p><p>tremulous, wilful little mouth and a nose </p><p>one couldn’t find fault with. </p><p> She handled the liquor as she might</p><p>handle a dead snake. Bill fretted inwardly, </p><p>but managed to throttle his feelings, until </p><p>along toward 2 A. M., when the tired droop </p><p>of her body moved him to pull the string for </p><p>a mild toot. </p><p> “This ain’t no time nor place nor job for a</p><p>girl. I votes Miss Alice to bed.” </p><p> “When I want your advise how to run</p><p>my business I’ll ask for it, Mr. Watkins,” </p><p>said Adolf, and thought the call-down got </p><p>by, so thoughtfully quiet did Bill return his </p><p>attention to the game. </p><p> Bill was getting sore on another count be-</p><p>sides the girl. Adolf had won handsomely </p><p>and was laying back on his winnings. If </p><p>the jackpot opened high he couldn’t be </p><p>tempted in on a pair of aces, and when he </p><p>was in he checked the bet, and if called, laid </p><p>down a full house or fours with an irritating </p><p>display of molars. He piled his winnings in </p><p>nice orderly piles and had a damnably tan- </p><p>talizing way of wolfing the coin with his eyes </p><p>and raising them with clumsy-jointed fingers </p><p>and shedding them down lingeringly, lov- </p><p>ingly, with a soft metallic click that was </p><p>evidently music to his miserly soul. </p><p> “-!” growled Bill, and promptly</p><p>apologized to the girl. “Of all the piker </p><p>poker-players and ground-hogs! I’d as lief </p><p>toss craps with a coon up a back alley.” </p><p> “I ain’t in this for my health,” grinned</p><p>Adolf. </p><p> “Where’s the game if we all lay back?”</p><p>demanded Bill.</p><p> “You ain’t got nothing to lay back on,”</p><p>Adolf argued practically. </p><p> “You’re in it for the game, ain’t you?”</p><p>“I’m in it to win,” Adolf replied with </p><p>simple conviction. </p><p> Bill’s eyes suddenly lost their humorous</p><p>twinkle. He pushed back his chair and </p><p>shook out cramped legs, rising. </p><p> “Well, it’s cost me eighty plunks to get a</p><p>line on your play. I’ve got three plunks </p><p>to my name and a sorrel to take me home.” </p><p>He picked up three dollars. “Here, Miss </p><p>Alice—” he pressed the money into her re- </p><p>luctant hand—“buy yourself a real petti- </p><p>coat. That gunnysack makeshift don’t </p><p>belong in this century. Olsen, we’ll adjourn </p><p>till next Saturday.” </p><p> He gave the logger and the artichoke</p><p>A Ward of the State </p><p>143 </p><p>grower a friendly nod and went to the </p><p>stables, saddled, mounted and rode off </p><p>under a sprinkling of morning stars that </p><p>tied knots in itself in its steep climb. </p><p>HE DID not make the Saturday </p><p>date. The superintendent was </p><p>called up to the San Francisco office </p><p>and he had to be on the job. But he got </p><p>away at dawn on Sunday, reaching the road- </p><p>house before breakfast. Riding the sorrel </p><p>'round to stables, he suddenly drew rein on a </p><p>startling phenomenon. </p><p> Alice was at the wash-tub—on Sunday,</p><p>Bill thought savagely. That, however, was </p><p>not the startling part of it. The thing that </p><p>made him draw rein and breath was her </p><p>action. She was wringing a man’s under- </p><p>shirt—a giant’s undershirt—in her hands </p><p>with a ferocity quite out of keeping with the </p><p>blue Sabbath skies and green-patched world </p><p>of mountain and valley. Then she savagely </p><p>shook it out and in one temper-strengthened </p><p>tear ripped it from collar to hem, flung it in </p><p>the dust under her feet and jumped on it, to </p><p>the tune of three explosive damns. </p><p> “Now, now,” purred Bill. “That ain’t</p><p>nice—not from a lady.” </p><p> She swung ’round, her eyes full of fight.</p><p> “Go and mind your own business!” she</p><p>snapped. </p><p> She glared at him like a wild animal, ten</p><p>seconds, perhaps, then she flung her skirt </p><p>over her head, exposing a shameless gunny- </p><p>sack petticoat, and sobbed as if dreams and </p><p>romance and joy were come to an end. </p><p> Bill slid from his saddle and approached</p><p>warily. </p><p> “Aw come, Miss Alice,” he crooned.</p><p>“Come, now, let up. Just stop a moment </p><p>and take a think. Kind o’ all in, eh? </p><p>Work late at night and early o’ morning. I </p><p>guess I know. They tried up at the mill to </p><p>run in twelve-hour shifts, week days and </p><p>Sundays, anJwas always bawling about the </p><p>labor problem because the boys lit out </p><p>soon’s they had a stake. Why don’t you </p><p>quit?”</p><p> An answer came muffled through the skirt.</p><p> “I mustn’t. They’d catch me and send</p><p>me to the correction school. I’m a ward of </p><p>the State.” </p><p> “S-o—” mused Bill, gaining time, for</p><p>ward of the State was something outside of </p><p>his experience and comprehension. He </p><p>took a toothpick from his ear and chewed </p><p>thoughtfully on it. </p><p> “Why didn’t you buy that petticoat I</p><p>gave you the money for?” he asked by way </p><p>of opener. </p><p> “He—” she dropped the skirt from her</p><p>stormy face to jerk a thumb toward the </p><p>house—“is my legal guardian. I haveta </p><p>give up to him.” </p><p> “Well, what’s eating you this morning</p><p>particular? Kind o’ all in? Don’t look at </p><p>me so all-fired. Can’t you make it out I’m </p><p>your big, big brother, or, say, le’s have a </p><p>little make-believe you’re Cinderella and </p><p>I’m the fairy godmother on the job. Where </p><p>do you hail from?” </p><p> “Over to the Pescadero Mountains.”</p><p> “Got relatives there?”</p><p> “An uncle getting out ties.”</p><p> Bill cast away a mangled toothpick and</p><p>took another. </p><p> “M’mm. And you kept cabin for him?”</p><p> “I ran away.”</p><p> “So—sure you did. Ran away from the</p><p>old woodchopper and his demijohn of dago </p><p>red and cusses. Wanted to see the great </p><p>big wide world beyond the mountains; kind </p><p>of sick of getting it second-hand from </p><p>stories, eh? Poor UT girl!” </p><p> “I ain’t a poor little girl,” she fired back</p><p>with spirit. “And if I did run away what </p><p>business is it of yourn?” </p><p> “When a gal serves licker till morning</p><p>and is at the wash-tub before eats it’s every </p><p>man’s business. I like spirit; but don’t </p><p>overdo it, little one. Maybe if you could </p><p>fall for the fairy godmother make-believe</p><p>you and me could get together and loosen </p><p>Olsen’s clutch-hold on you.” </p><p> “You can’t neither. He’s got awful big</p><p>pull. He could serve a soldier with liquor </p><p>and they wouldn’t touch him.” </p><p>“So—but how comes the son-of-a—beg </p><p>pardon, but how comes he your guardian?” </p><p>“I ran away dressed like a boy. It was </p><p>the only way. They’re awful mean to girls </p><p>that’s just bumming ’round.” </p><p> “I see; you got into overalls, which it is</p><p>felonious for a girl to wear male togs in this </p><p>State. You was going to see the world, and </p><p>lits over the county-line and strikes the first </p><p>place handy for a job. I see the layout. </p><p>You chops kindling and cleans around a </p><p>while; then Adolf tumbles to your secret and </p><p>hauls you before the judge he votes for.” </p><p>“Yes. And the probation officer in- </p><p>vestigated uncle’s and said it was no proper </p><p>home for me and they-” </p><p> “So—” softly. “I’m wise. They make</p><p>T44 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Adolf your legal guardian and tosses him a </p><p>cook, wash-girl, bed-maker, waitress, seam- </p><p>stress, etcetera—not counting the draw a </p><p>likely girl is to a road-house—for her board </p><p>and keeps, and hold over you the correction </p><p>school for bad girls if you run away. You </p><p>sure got a hard-luck spiel, Miss—I ain’t </p><p>got the other half of your name?” </p><p> “Jones.”</p><p> “Miss Jones. You’re sure up agin it.</p><p>But it ain’t no good tearing up like you was. </p><p>You was only hurting yourself. Go easy. </p><p>Leave it to fairy godmother. Come; let’s </p><p>shake on it.” </p><p> She let him take her hand, her face</p><p>brightening like a hurt child who has been </p><p>comforted. He held the soft, little white </p><p>hand in his big brown fist as if it were a </p><p>fragile cream puff. </p><p> “Mum’s the word, Miss Alice,” he cau-</p><p>tioned, then swung over to the bar. </p><p> “Howdy, Adolf. Howdy,” to the park-</p><p>ing gentry around. “Here I am for that </p><p>revenge I promised myself, Adolf. You </p><p>got me last time, but-” </p><p> “Nothing doing,” said Adolf with finality,</p><p>and grinned. </p><p> “Why—what do you mean? You mean</p><p>to say you ain’t going to give me a chance to </p><p>even up?” incredulously. </p><p> “I’d be a nice easy sucker, wouldn’t I, to</p><p>go up against your coin now you’ve got the </p><p>line of my play?” scoffed Adolf. </p><p> Bill regarded him much the same as if he</p><p>had taken a sharp turn on the mountain </p><p>trail and come face to face with an ele- </p><p>phant. </p><p> “You’re joshing—sure,” he presently</p><p>remarked. </p><p> “Gotta ’tend bar,” Adolf sheepishly ex-</p><p>cused. </p><p> “Give me something to wash the taste o’</p><p>that outen my mouth,” Bill demanded.</p><p>“Gimme lager.” </p><p> He gargled his mouth ostentatiously and</p><p>banged the glass on the bar. </p><p> “So—” he purred, getting a great deal</p><p>of real meaning into his favorite mono- </p><p>syllable. “You think you’re going to get </p><p>by with it, Olsen. Take if from me—take </p><p>it from Bill Watkins; I’m going to get it </p><p>back on you; I’m going to get it back on you </p><p>good and plenty.” </p><p> “I ain’t worrying none,” said Adolf</p><p>easily, displaying his crowded gravestones. </p><p> “No; you ain’t the sense to worry. Grin,</p><p>you lug-eared coyote—grin! But I’m giv- </p><p>ing you fair-to-warmer warning I’ll even </p><p>up with you.” </p><p> He went to the stables, got the sorrel,</p><p>mounted and rode off. </p><p> Next Saturday he was back again. Ap-</p><p>parently he had forgotten the matter. </p><p>Adolf thought so. Adolf received too many </p><p>such idle threats that came to nothing to </p><p>give it much thought. </p><p> “You’re a good sport, Bill Watkins,” he</p><p>complimented. </p><p> “Oh, I don’t cry over my medicine,”</p><p>said Bill easily. </p><p> Adolf grinned.</p><p>BILL spent freely during his visit </p><p>and between whiles maneuvered </p><p>himself into the company of Miss </p><p>Jones. The next two week-ends passed </p><p>much the same. He was laying for Adolf, </p><p>and with the girl to make the visits attrac- </p><p>tive he was willing to lay a year or more, but </p><p>Adolf was warming to his free money </p><p>quicker than that. Sooner or later he </p><p>would be asking Bill’s advice on something </p><p>or the other. Something would crop up. </p><p>It was not so fast with the girl. </p><p> On the face of it she ought to have been</p><p>easily attached to a hundred and fifty per </p><p>but was as hard winning as if she were a </p><p>daughter of the Knickerbocks with the pick </p><p>of the land. Still she was not altogether</p><p>discouraging. For one thing she exhibited </p><p>an interest in Bill’s welfare. </p><p> “What for do you want to let him get</p><p>your money so free over the bar? He only </p><p>thinks you’re easy.” </p><p> “And you don’t like such false notions</p><p>about me to circulate,” he teased. “Kind </p><p>o’ humiliating, ain’t it. Sure, he calls me </p><p>sucker. That’s all right. I’ve got to have </p><p>some excuse for coming around. I ain’t </p><p>yet ready to let him know I’m out to steal </p><p>his ward. When are you going to let me </p><p>hitch you to a meal-ticket, Allie?” </p><p> “I haven’t given it a thought,” she</p><p>flashed. </p><p> That night when he was about to saddle,</p><p>Olsen came ’round to the stables. </p><p> “Bill,” he said, “if you hear of any one</p><p>wanting to buy a car I can throw a little </p><p>commission your way.” </p><p> “That’s real kind. The chances are I</p><p>will and the chances are equal I won’t. </p><p>Le’s have a look at her.” </p><p> Adolf led away to a shack garage and ex-</p><p>hibited his wonder. </p><p>A Ward of the State </p><p>145 </p><p> “I bought her tQ run a stage-line through</p><p>to Half Moon Bay, but there wasn’t enough </p><p>business. I got her on a bargain at eleven </p><p>hundred.” </p><p> “You’re imagining vain things. If you</p><p>gave a cent more than eight hundred for her </p><p>you’d have a lunacy commission sitting on </p><p>you. What’ll you take?” </p><p> “Seven hundred;”</p><p> “I didn’t ask you what you want but</p><p>what you’ll take.” </p><p> “The tires are almost new and there</p><p>ain’t a scratch on her,” pursued Adolf. </p><p> “When I’m buying a hoss I don’ buy hide</p><p>and shoes,” drawled Bill, taking a look at </p><p>the engine. He investigated thoroughly. </p><p>Adolf forestalled the result. </p><p> “Tell you what, Bill. You find me a</p><p>sucker at five hundred and I’ll slip a hun- </p><p>ched to you.” </p><p> Bill helped himself to a toothpick, an</p><p>innocent action, but one provocative of </p><p>profound thought. </p><p> “Well, maybe I hear of a buyer and may-</p><p>be I don’t. Let’s have that down in writ- </p><p>ing;” </p><p> “Between friends—” began Adolf, but</p><p>shut up at the look in Bill’s eyes. “All </p><p>right.” </p><p> Bill chased a paper bag trundling before</p><p>a freaky slap of wind, flattened it out and </p><p>wrote the agreement, which both signed. </p><p>Bill called Alice to witness the signatures. </p><p> “Put your name right there under mine,</p><p>Miss Jones.” </p><p> When Bill found bimself on the mountain</p><p>road he chuckled. He had had a prospec- </p><p>tive buyer in mind the minute Adolf mooted </p><p>the sale of the car. As he neared the mill he </p><p>dropped off to the left and rode down to the </p><p>village of Boulder Creek, which lay in per- </p><p>petual mountain shadow amidst a paradise </p><p>of trickling streams and miniature water-</p><p>falls and whose inhabitants put an interpre- </p><p>tation on the word “business” that would </p><p>make Machiavelli look like a Sunday-school </p><p>teacher. He rode to a general merchandise </p><p>store owned by Olaf Wassel, ostensibly to </p><p>lay in a stock of smokes and compliment </p><p>him on the quality of the last lot of beans </p><p>supplied to the mill boarding-house. This, </p><p>however, was merely introductory. </p><p> “Didn’t you tell me you were selling out</p><p>and going to the old country?” </p><p> “Sure. I got a feller from San Francisco</p><p>coming down to look over next week.” </p><p> “So—you wanta buy a car?”</p><p>10 </p><p> “T’-1 do.”</p><p> “Yes you do,” insinuated Bill. “It’ll</p><p>make the business look that much more </p><p>prosperous. Every successful business man </p><p>owns a car nowadays. Anyways you don’t </p><p>stand to lose a cent on this deal. I’ll take </p><p>the car off your hands and leave you a hun- </p><p>dred plunks to the good.” </p><p> “My two ears are wide open,” Wassel</p><p>invited suspiciously. </p><p> Bill took the right one and outlined the</p><p>“deal.” Olaf listened with pop-eyed de- </p><p>light. Still, he had his doubts. </p><p> “S’posing you refuse to take the car off</p><p>my hands?” </p><p> “S’pose I don’t know my way about and</p><p>done with it,” scoffed Bill. “Isn’t the car </p><p>my rake-off. But whichever way it goes </p><p>you stand to win a hundred plunks and risk </p><p>nothing.” </p><p> “All right,” agreed Olaf. “I’ll drop over</p><p>and see my countryman.” </p><p> “Oh sure,” purred Bill, as if the point</p><p>were new to him. “He is a countryman of </p><p>yours—o’ course.” </p><p> His next move was to call on “Judge”</p><p>Oppenheim. This was after the Monday </p><p>evening whistle blew. Oppenheim’s mani- </p><p>fold activities were set forth in enamelled </p><p>lettering on the front window—insurance,</p><p>wills, bequests, collections, attainders, mort- </p><p>gages, loans. Therefore it was perfectly </p><p>superfluous of Bill to ask him if he were open </p><p>to make a bit of side-money. </p><p> “Far be money from my aching</p><p>thoughts,” smirked Oppenheim. </p><p> “Then give ear to this layout of mine</p><p>and wise me if it’s a legal cinch,” said Bill, </p><p>and laid out the lines of his pleasing plot. </p><p> Oppenheim heard him to the end. His</p><p>moon-face, flat and empty as a clean dinner- </p><p>plate, suffused his best approach to a </p><p>grin. </p><p> “There isn’t a judge would hesitate five</p><p>minutes in finding in your favor. It’s </p><p>hidebound. He’ll bring suit, of course. </p><p>You retain me, I take it.” </p><p> “You take it right, Oppy. S’ long.”</p><p>THREE evenings later Bill’s soul </p><p>was delighted to see a nicely pol- </p><p>ished car with almost new tires </p><p>standing before the store. He thought </p><p>Wassel might have let him know that the </p><p>deal was gone through. He reserved a </p><p>thought about it as he entered the store. </p><p>“How’s she coming, Olaf?” </p><p>146 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Fine and dandy. That ’Frisco feller’ll</p><p>be down to take stock Sunday and Monday. </p><p>I’ll keep the car around till I’ve turned </p><p>over.” </p><p> “Attaboy,” agreed Bill, and Wassell was</p><p>beautifully deceived. “When you leav- </p><p>ing?” </p><p> “Thursday, I guess. I’ll hand the car</p><p>over to you Wednesday night and take your </p><p>hundred dollars, eh?” </p><p> Bill nodded, but outside indulged in a</p><p>short soliloquy. </p><p> “Yes, you will, you will, but you don’t</p><p>think you will.” </p><p> Saturday he climbed the serpentine</p><p>mountain road again to the road-house. </p><p>Adolf’s welcoming grin was a yard wide. </p><p> “I put the deal through with the feller</p><p>you sent over. I’ll owe you a hundred </p><p>plunks.” </p><p> “What’s the matter with not getting out</p><p>of debt right now?” </p><p> “I ain’t collected yet. Party’s a little</p><p>shy on ready money; gave me two notes for </p><p>two-fifty each, due at seven and fourteen </p><p>days.” </p><p> “Good biz,” purred Bill. “A’right; I</p><p>guess I can wait for mine. Have a smile— </p><p>everybody.” </p><p> He nodded toward the brass-rail foot-</p><p>polishers, flung down a coin, grabbed liis </p><p>drink and slipped out ’round to the kitchen </p><p>door and imitated the liquid call of the </p><p>meadow lark to its soulmate. By fortunate </p><p>coincidence Alice had occasion right there- </p><p>after to empty a dish-pan in the yard. </p><p>Bill’s eyes twinkled, but he was too wise to </p><p>ask if anything was the matter with the </p><p>sink. </p><p> “Allie, I’m coming over in my car next</p><p>week to take you out. You’ll want some </p><p>fixings, little one, unless you’re not agin </p><p>marrying in a gunnysack petticoat.” </p><p> “I haven’t any idea of marrying in mind,”</p><p>short and quick. </p><p> “Life,” philosophized Bill, “is like a</p><p>mountain road; we never know what we’re </p><p>meeting ’round the bend.” </p><p> His eyes wolfed her and he seemed hard</p><p>put to it to control his empty arms. </p><p> She backed away a little, whispering</p><p>objection. </p><p> “He won’t never let me—go out riding;</p><p>he’s my legal guardian.” </p><p> “Leave it to your fairy godmother’s</p><p>magic wand to dissipate those objections,” </p><p>crowed Bill, and took a step toward her. </p><p>“Allie,” he began on a softer note, “Allie </p><p> “Bill,” she interjected with scary quick-</p><p>ness, “I got to get supper.” </p><p> She flashed to the kitchen.</p><p> Events crowded Bill’s existence next</p><p>week. Tuesday night he dropped into the </p><p>store at Boulder Creek, “T’ see how the </p><p>’Frisco buyer was making out,” he put it. </p><p>Wassel was packing his grips, also he was </p><p>shaved. When a man shaves on a mid- </p><p>week night he’s off to the city in the morning </p><p>or he’s sitting on a coroner’s jury, was </p><p>Bill’s observation. But he kept it to him- </p><p>self. </p><p> “See you tomorrow night, Olaf,” he said,</p><p>significantly of the bargain to hand over </p><p>the car then, and swung out, glanced cau- </p><p>tiously around, then slipped to the shed that </p><p>served for garage, glided in and opened the </p><p>valves of all four tires. </p><p> “That’ll keep him busy, if mayhap I</p><p>don’t hear the alarum go off in the morn- </p><p>ing,” he told himself. “It’s a cinch he </p><p>won’t try out that wriggly mountain road </p><p>at nighttime with a car he ain’t familiar </p><p>with.” </p><p> But he did hear the alarum, and was up,</p><p>saddled and riding down to the store as </p><p>dawn struck the mountain skyline. Even </p><p>at that Wassel was earlier. The machine </p><p>stood before the store on four hard tires, </p><p>with Wassel’s grips on the rear seat and</p><p>Wassel himself about to flit. Bill’s eyes </p><p>twinkled. </p><p> “Was you borrowing my car for a trip to</p><p>city, Olaf? That’s a’right, if only you’d </p><p>mentioned it beforehand.” </p><p> “Your car,” blustered Wassel. “Since</p><p>when? I got a perfectly good bill of sale </p><p>on that car.” </p><p> “So—” in that soft, caressing tone that</p><p>conveyed gentle remonstrance, persuasion, </p><p>lurking warning, invitation to sit down hip- </p><p>to-hip and talk reasonably. “I’ve brought </p><p>my hundred dollars, ’cording to agreement, </p><p>and I take back the car, or sick Olsen on to </p><p>you for security for those notes before you </p><p>lit out. Just tumble them grips out, </p><p>Wassel, and don’t try to pull any fool </p><p>stuff.” </p><p>Wassel grimaced, but saw that Bill had </p><p>the drop on him. They went into the house </p><p>and fixed up a bill of sale, which Bill stowed </p><p>in his vest pocket with Adolf’s bill of sale to </p><p>Wassel, then hitched the sorrel to the car, </p><p>cranked and drove off, the sorrel waltzing </p><p>A Ward of the State </p><p>147 </p><p>on its hind legs. Passing the superin- </p><p>tendent’s bungalow he saw Goodyear hand- </p><p>ing his wife into their car for an early run up </p><p>to city. He stopped to Goodyear’s hail. </p><p> “What’s the layout, Bill—training the</p><p>sorrel for circus?” </p><p> “Nope. I’m bribing a girl to give me a</p><p>little of her company off and on between the </p><p>lure of city frivolities,” returned Bill, dig- </p><p>ging at the notorious fact that Goodyear </p><p>only held wife and job together by the bribe </p><p>of an eight cylinder that brought the city </p><p>within a few hours’ run. </p><p> He addressed the pampered doll in the</p><p>car. </p><p> “Would it be trespassing on your kind-</p><p>ness, Mrs. Goodyear, to do a little buying </p><p>for me in the city?” </p><p> “Delighted. What brand do you chew?”</p><p>Bill ignored the idleness; he was too dead </p><p>in earnest. </p><p> “I’d like for you to get a nice warm fur</p><p>coat like you’re wearing, and a hat to go </p><p>along with it and something smart in the </p><p>way of petticoats.” </p><p> “Who is she, Bill?” was the instant</p><p>feminine cry. </p><p> Goodyear echoed the question.</p><p> “Where d’ye find her, Bill?”</p><p> “That’s neither here nor there.”</p><p> “Well—what is she like?” persisted Mrs.</p><p>Goodyear. “Give me a line to go on in my </p><p>buying.” </p><p> “I hate to crow one woman over another,”</p><p>Bill answered, with simple sincerity. </p><p> Mrs. Goodyear laughed.</p><p> “But I must know what she is like.</p><p>You’ll—she’ll want a bit of color in the hat. </p><p>Is she dark or fair, tall or short, stout or </p><p>slender, eyes black, brown or blue?” </p><p> Bill drew a toothpick from his ear, started</p><p>to put it between his teeth, remembered he </p><p>was talking to a lady, tossed it away," </p><p>frowned and lined up all his gray matter on </p><p>the job. </p><p> “She’s kind o’ dainty, not quite your size</p><p>—pretty; her eyes are-” </p><p> “Stars out of the sky,” bubbled Mrs.</p><p>Goodyear. “Her feet are posies; she has </p><p>the grace of a fawn and her smile is like </p><p>moonlight on an azure lake. Oh, Bill, </p><p>you’ve taken it bad. Come down to earth, </p><p>crazy man, and give me facts. How much </p><p>shall I spend—how far shall I go.” </p><p> “Go the limit,” he roared, but qualified it</p><p>down to two to three hundred. </p><p> Mrs. Goodyear laughed a little enviously.</p><p> “Very good. But I simply must know</p><p>what she is like—what would suit her?” </p><p> “I ain’t no hand describing wimmin,”</p><p>Bill confessed. But out of despair came </p><p>inspiration. “What’s the matter with you </p><p>stopping at the road-house just over the </p><p>county-line and seeing her yourself. Peek </p><p>into the kitchen.” </p><p> “Oh, Bill, you aren’t taking to wife a girl</p><p>working at a road-house?” she shrilly pro- </p><p>tested. “You could do ever so much better </p><p>than—” She pulled up on a danger-signal </p><p>in his eyes. “All right. Shall it be C. O. D. </p><p>or shall I start a charge account?” </p><p> “Better open an account. She’ll be</p><p>wanting to send up once in a while for </p><p>something.” </p><p> He wiped his brow over the ordeal as she</p><p>shot off. He met Goodyear’s grin belliger- </p><p>ently. But the superintendent was out </p><p>to grease the matrimonial wheels. </p><p> “You can have the bungalow next the</p><p>accountant’s, Bill,” anxiously, “I’m trusting </p><p>to your good judgment to select a lady. </p><p>We’re a small society here and the wrong </p><p>kind can make a heap of trouble.” </p><p> “Don’t worry, Jim. Lots of good rock</p><p>lies in unlikely places.” </p><p> “You’d better spare a couple of men from</p><p>your gang to fix the bungalow up a bit. </p><p>You can draw on the storekeeper for neces- </p><p>saries—Bill. Don’t bust us.” </p><p> Bill went off with a satisfactory feeling</p><p>that the worst part of the business of getting </p><p>married was over. </p><p> He settled into the routine, joyously an-</p><p>ticipating Friday, when Olsen would hop </p><p>along to collect on the first note. He </p><p>expected Adolf to suffer a disappointment. </p><p>He expected him to bring his disappoint- </p><p>ment to the quarry. He expected Adolf to </p><p>be raging, and chewed a peck of toothpicks </p><p>in blissful satisfaction. </p><p>FRIDAY forenoon passed without </p><p>excitement. In the afternoon they </p><p>were blasting. Through a sus- </p><p>pended cloud of fine dust squat, swarthy </p><p>Mexicans and Italians showed against the </p><p>cement rock like roaches on a kitchen wall, </p><p>humped on narrow ledges, shaking to the </p><p>tremendous vibrations of gattling electric </p><p>drills that shrilled and screamed like a </p><p>battle. Then drills and feeding wires were </p><p>drawn away to safety. Power charges were </p><p>tamped home, whilst Bill ran connecting </p><p>wires for the electric spark. </p><p>148 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Bill always saw to this work personally.</p><p>He took no chances on misfires and the risk </p><p>of collecting men in instalments and de- </p><p>priving a mother back in sunny Italy of her </p><p>monthly p. o. It was very particular work, </p><p>so he was somewhat nettled that Adolf </p><p>should choose that moment to intrude two </p><p>hundred and thirty pounds of volcanic rage </p><p>into the scenery. Yes, Adolf had mislaid </p><p>his heathenish grin down in an interview </p><p>with the new owner of the store below. </p><p> “That feller Wassel has lit out!” he</p><p>shrieked, waving a piece of paper with a </p><p>face-value of two hundred and fifty dollars </p><p>but which wouldn’t have lost him a cent </p><p>if he had put a match to it. </p><p> Bill finished his work.</p><p> “Stand back everybody!” he roared.</p><p>Squat men-shapes dropped from the </p><p>cliff’s face and ran doubled with arms </p><p>shielding heads and ear-drums to safety. </p><p>He ran to the controlling switch, blundering </p><p>Adolf and his bit of paper out of his path. </p><p> “Stand clear, you fool,” he hissed, “or</p><p>you’ll never wake up to know what hap- </p><p>pened to you.” </p><p> A couple of gesticulating Italians tried to</p><p>convey the same warning. </p><p> “Hit him with a rock!” yelled Bill, waiting</p><p>to throw the switch. </p><p> One of the fellows took the order literally.</p><p>Adolf ran. Bill swung the tin}' switch. A </p><p>terrific explosion tore off the face of the cliff. </p><p>Before the echoes had died out of the rever- </p><p>berating mountains the laborers were swing- </p><p>ing picks to clear the runway for the dump </p><p>cars. </p><p> Bill slipped a toothpick between his lips</p><p>and turned to Adolf. </p><p> “Did you wish to see me about some-</p><p>thing, Adolf?” </p><p> “That feller Wassel has lit out for the old</p><p>country,” screamed the frantic Swede. </p><p> “So—but why the excitement? He don’t</p><p>owe me anything.” </p><p> “He’s a crook! You knew he was a</p><p>crook!” </p><p> “Well,” drawled Bill, “I can’t say I’m</p><p>surprised. But you ain’t so strong on </p><p>Sunday-school sentiments yourself. What’s </p><p>your kick?” </p><p> “He’s done me up! I’m stuck with five</p><p>hundred dollars on bad notes!” </p><p> “You don’t say. I take it you took his</p><p>notes unsecured. That was mighty care- </p><p>less of you, Adolf. You disappoint me </p><p>grievously. I thought you was a real on- </p><p>the-dot business man. You sure gave me </p><p>the notion in a little poker sitting that you </p><p>was right there with the goods. Too bad,” </p><p>chirped Bill with not so much sympathy in </p><p>tone as the words might imply. </p><p> He drew off and gave Adolf a profound</p><p>quizz, as if there was something unfamiliar </p><p>about him. </p><p> “You seem changed, Adolf. I can’t</p><p>quite—yes, I got it; you’ve lost your grin. </p><p>Too bad. You wasn’t half so homely with </p><p>it as you are without it.” </p><p> “You fixed this up with him!” bellowed</p><p>Olsen. “You’re both crooks!” </p><p> “So—easy, Adolf, easy. Not so loud</p><p>around here. I’m ticklish about my repita- </p><p>tion. If you took unsecured notes that was </p><p>plumb foolish, I’m real sorry I wasn’t there </p><p>at the dicker to teach you the simple rudi- </p><p>ments o’ business. Lemme see how we </p><p>stand. I got to collect a hundred commis- </p><p>sion, ain’t it?” </p><p> Adolf fell back on his mother tongue for</p><p>curses sufficiently explosive and deep to </p><p>ventilate his rage. </p><p> “You don’t get a cent! You’ve got my</p><p>car. I’ll go get it.” </p><p> “Well, you’re steering your own ship, o’</p><p>course. But don’t bite off more’n you kin </p><p>chew. Seems to me I got your bill-of-sale </p><p>to Olaf and one from him to me and that </p><p>notion of yours looks very ugly like grand </p><p>larceny.”</p><p> “I’ll file an attachment on the car! I’ll</p><p>attach your salary! I’ll have the law on </p><p>you, you crook!” yelled Adolf. </p><p> “So—” softly. “Don’t get et up about</p><p>it. I’ll drop over in my car tomorrow </p><p>night and see how you make out. Like to </p><p>look over the mill whilst you’re here? It’s </p><p>interesting to see the machinery grind and </p><p>burn the rock and bag it. We’ve got a </p><p>patent bagger that cost an inventive </p><p>genius a whole lot of hard thinking. I’ll </p><p>show you around. What—you gotta go? </p><p>S’long then.” </p><p> His eyes twinkled happily to see Adolf</p><p>stumble away in blind rage, his great feet </p><p>stubbing strewn boulders, like a great, </p><p>hulking Viking reeling from lost battle, </p><p>stopping every now and then to turn and </p><p>shake a huge fist and imprecate in his </p><p>mother tongue. </p><p> When whistle blew Bill dropped down</p><p>to the sheriff’s cottage. </p><p> “Howdy, Jim What’s in it for you to</p><p>serve an attachment?” </p><p>A Ward of the State </p><p>149 </p><p> “Three-fifty.”</p><p> “So—that’s disappointing; I sure thought</p><p>I was throwing more than that your way; </p><p>you’ll be pasting an attachment on my car </p><p>and putting one on my salary. A measly </p><p>seven dollars.” </p><p> “Unless the case is hung up, when there’s</p><p>a new attachment on your salary each </p><p>month.” </p><p> Bill slapped his knee with joyous in-</p><p>spiration. He was on the monthly payroll, </p><p>with other department heads, notwithstand- </p><p>ing his weekly visits to Adolph, which he </p><p>financed in a frenzied way by advance </p><p>drawings on his salary or borrowings—that </p><p>is, when the poker game hit him hard in </p><p>the first Saturday of the month. He told </p><p>the sheriff he would get the cashier at the </p><p>mills to shift him temporarily to the weekly </p><p>payroll of the laborers, which would put </p><p>Adolph to the necessity of making a fresh </p><p>attachment every week, to the financial </p><p>betterment of the sheriff. Then he went </p><p>on to “Judge” Oppenheim’s. </p><p> “Oppy, that feller has bitten, and bitten</p><p>hard.” </p><p> “He’s suing?”</p><p> “Betcher he’s suing.”</p><p> “When do you want the case set?”</p><p> “No hurry. We’re pretty busy up at the</p><p>mills on a Government contract. Also </p><p>there’s a bit girl involved as ain’t yet on to </p><p>her own mind. Say a couple o’ months.” </p><p>“I’ll see to it. But he’ll tie up your </p><p>wages.” </p><p> “Sure; he promised that. Suits me;</p><p>make me save up something to git spliced </p><p>on. By the way, you will counter-sue for a </p><p>hundred dollars commission, and whilst </p><p>you’re on the job shoot through a damage </p><p>claim for my pecuniary loss consequent on </p><p>him tying up my salary and injury to my </p><p>repitation. I understand loser pays at- </p><p>torneys’ fees, witnesses, mileage and sundry </p><p>expenses?” </p><p> “It is customary, if the winner’s case is</p><p>strong, and I’ll wager the judge’ll reach a </p><p>verdict favorable to you on all counts </p><p>without leaving the bench.” </p><p> “You know the law of it, Oppy. Tune</p><p>her up. Figure strong on the injury to my </p><p>repitation and the nervous torture I’m </p><p>going through,” blandly. “I’m losing </p><p>weight .dreadful, Oppy. The doctor is </p><p>piling up a bill agin me. I can’t sleep. I’m </p><p>that nervous I can’t touch giant powder. </p><p>I’m likely to lose my job. I’m hit hard, </p><p>Oppy, in my tenderest feelings—in my repi- </p><p>tation. He called me a crook, Oppy, right </p><p>out before the boys. I could ha’ dropped in </p><p>my tracks fer shame. He’s dragging me in- </p><p>to court. I’m all broken up and-” </p><p> “Get out of here, you roaring mountain</p><p>lion,” laughed Oppenheim. </p><p> Next morning Bill put an Italian to</p><p>polishing the car for the evening trip, but </p><p>stacked up against a disappointment. </p><p>Goodyear said he was called up to the city </p><p>office. Bill more than suspected that a </p><p>yearning for Mrs. Goodyear, was behind </p><p>the call, for the lady had not yet returned. </p><p>Still he could not kick, particularly as he </p><p>had a hunch he might want the superin- </p><p>tendent to spell him for a couple of days in </p><p>the near future, if his intentions got by with </p><p>Alice. </p><p>MONDAY morning the sheriff </p><p>served the attachments. Bill was </p><p>as gay over it as if he had received a </p><p>present. The same evening Goodyear and </p><p>his wife drove in. She brought a fur coat, a </p><p>hat-box and half a dozen petticoats, and a </p><p>charge slip that would have flattened out </p><p>any one but Bill or a millionaire with a </p><p>loveless home treating his stenog. But he </p><p>thought of Saturday and grinned. Fate, </p><p>however, in the shape of Adolf’s attorney </p><p>moved the presentation two days nearer. </p><p> Thrifty Adolf had seen to the simple</p><p>business of filing the attachments without </p><p>incurring attorney’s expenses, confident </p><p>that he was merely calling Bill’s bluff. It </p><p>was not till he was served with summonses </p><p>on the counter-suits that he woke up to </p><p>where he stood and took a scary flight into </p><p>San Mateo to consult an attorney, who took </p><p>something less than ten minutes to discover</p><p>that his client was in bad all ’round. </p><p> “You took the notes in payment on the</p><p>car and gave bill of sale. The responsibility </p><p>was on you to see that the notes were se- </p><p>cured. You haven’t a leg to stand on. </p><p>Watkins’s commission stands good, and his </p><p>damage claim against you looks to dig a big </p><p>hole in your bank account. Your best way </p><p>out of a bad mess is to let me see his attor- </p><p>ney and try for a compromise.” </p><p> “But they worked a crooked game on</p><p>me,” whined Adolf. </p><p> “That is presumptive, but hard to prove.</p><p>I wouldn’t be too noisy about that, if I </p><p>were you.” </p><p> “Is that the law?” Adolf demanded</p><p>150 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>fiercely, as if law had suddenly assumed </p><p>cloven hoofs and horns. </p><p> “Certainly.”</p><p> Adolf howled. He ripped America and</p><p>American jurisprudence up and down like a </p><p>true hyphenate, until the attorney quietly </p><p>stopped him. </p><p> “Don’t abuse the hospitality of the coun-</p><p>try that is giving you home and livelihood. </p><p>As for your case, I would jeopardize my </p><p>standing by taking it into court, which, by </p><p>the way, would be in Santa Cruz, and I must </p><p>remind you that your pull stops at the </p><p>county-line. I’ll try and effect a compro- </p><p>mise in a friendly way, though it looks to me </p><p>as if this Watkins had it in for you.” </p><p> “Why should he? I ain’t never done him</p><p>dirt,” declared Adolf with simple belief. </p><p> “Well, a man in his position would be on</p><p>the staff payroll at the mills, yet he’s draw- </p><p>ing weekly salary with the laborers, to put </p><p>you to the expense of a weekly attachment, </p><p>I deduce.” </p><p> “The low-down skunk!”</p><p> “Possibly. But calling names isn’t help-</p><p>ing you. Are you for a compromise?” </p><p> “I gotta be, ain’t I?” snapped Adolf.</p><p>“You bring him over to the road-house and </p><p>I’ll spill a little licker to mellow the talk,” </p><p>he nicely arranged. </p><p> Accordingly Bill was called from the</p><p>“beanery” Thursday noon to the phone. </p><p>Oppenheim was on the line. He had had a </p><p>confab over the wires with Adolf’s attorney, </p><p>who invited all parties to the road-house that </p><p>night for an amicable settlement. </p><p> “Well,” said Bill, “I’d as lief take it to</p><p>court, only the Swede has one draw on me </p><p>he ain’t yet wise to. He might lug out his </p><p>legal guardianship, to a bit girl and spring a </p><p>straight-flush on me. I’ll pick you up in </p><p>the car about 4 o’clock.” </p><p> He went to Goodyear.</p><p> “Jim, I got a little law business to see to</p><p>this evening, and maybe after I’ll want to </p><p>slip up to city for a few days.” </p><p> “And you’re not going lonesome. All</p><p>right, Bill; Saunders can fill your shoes, </p><p>though he’ll sky-high our workmen’s in- </p><p>surance premiums. Good luck.” </p><p> A little after four he swung out on the</p><p>tortuous mountain road, in a sixty-dollar </p><p>suit that had seen daylight but twice in a </p><p>year’s possession, his chin as smooth as the </p><p>mill barber could make it, hair cut and laid </p><p>away on each side from a center line with </p><p>weighting bay rum, his face ferocious with </p><p>determination to bring to a show-down the </p><p>worst tangle in his career, a tangle that had </p><p>but minor connection with the compromise. </p><p> “Gals is funny things,” he confided to</p><p>Oppenheim. </p><p> “Bill, I’d take it with real relief if you</p><p>could budge your mind off girls and put it in </p><p>that steering-gear this trip,” opined the at- </p><p>torney as they swung ’round a sharp bend </p><p>and hung a wheel a thrilling moment over a </p><p>sheer drop of a thousand feet. </p><p> “Keep your eye on those bundles on the</p><p>back seat. Better take the hat-box on your </p><p>knees,” was all the satisfaction he got. </p><p> He shot ’round the road-house to the yard.</p><p>The San Mateo attorney’s rig was there. </p><p> “You go in, Oppy, and stall along for a</p><p>few moments,” said Bill, grabbing the </p><p>bundles and making stealthy steps to the </p><p>kitchen. </p><p> The ward of the State was up to her ears</p><p>in pots and pans, so busy she did not hear </p><p>the screen door at her back. Bill stood </p><p>rooted on the temptation of four inches of </p><p>pretty neck showing under a close-cropped </p><p>head and down to a gingham. Before he </p><p>had found his courage she had found him. </p><p> “Hullo, Allie,” he grinned. “Think I was</p><p>gone back on you ’cause I wasn’t around </p><p>last Saturday?” </p><p> “I didn’t think anything about it,”</p><p>she pouted, a little too readily to carry </p><p>conviction.</p><p> “Didn’t cry—not a teeny bit?” teased</p><p>Bill. </p><p> “Cry because there was one big mouth</p><p>less to peel ’talers for!” </p><p> “Well, I ain’t here to make you blush</p><p>confessions,” he brazened, dumping his </p><p>arm-load on a chair. “Your fairy god- </p><p>mother’s sent you some glad duds, and </p><p>there’s a buzz wagon outside that’ll put it </p><p>all over the coach-and-six stuff. You and </p><p>me are headed for one big streak of joy- </p><p>ride.” </p><p> “Speak for yourself,” she flashed, holding</p><p>a sloppy dish-rag for self-defense, so hungry </p><p>were his eyes. Then, in a quick change of </p><p>mood—“He won’t let me go.” </p><p> “Leave me to take care of that end.</p><p>Here-” </p><p> He advanced and pried the dish-rag from</p><p>her fingers and drew her two arms out </p><p>straight and loaded on the bundles, topping </p><p>them with the hat-box. </p><p> “You go up-stairs and get into those duds,</p><p>then take the front seat in our car and </p><p>A Ward of the State </p><p>151 </p><p>leave it all up to godmother’s magic wand.” </p><p> But she was still fighting.</p><p> “Our car. I haven’t any strings on your</p><p>car, Bill Watkins.” </p><p> “Allie,” said Bill with cool insolence,</p><p>“if you stand there back-sassing and looking </p><p>so pretty I’ll just grab you to the car as you </p><p>are and joy-ride in gingham.” </p><p> She flashed him a look, decided he was</p><p>capable of carrying out the threat and fled. </p><p>Hr!!-! BILL walked ’round to the bar. </p><p>He found the two attorneys skir- </p><p>mishing the preliminaries and big </p><p>Adolf trying to look happy. </p><p> “Glad to see you, Bill,” Adolf tooted</p><p>blandly. </p><p> “You’re a durned liar. You’d as lief see</p><p>Old Harry.” </p><p> Adolf had to swallow that.</p><p> “Have a smile.”</p><p> “I’m here strictly on business.”</p><p> “Y-e-s,” Adolf pushed hesitatingly off</p><p>his thick lips. “What are you going to do </p><p>about it?” </p><p> “Me? I ain’t doing nothing. I’m laying</p><p>back on my winnings, which I figure around </p><p>a mighty good second-hand car, a hundred </p><p>plunks commission and what we agree on </p><p>to balm my injured repitation, and expenses, </p><p>o’ course.” </p><p> Adolf tried to grin, but succeeded only in</p><p>manufacturing an expression about twice as </p><p>sad as a deserted seashore at murmuring </p><p>low tide with the sun sinking over the rim of </p><p>a sad world and a chilly breeze stealing in. </p><p>When he spoke his words seemed cloyed </p><p>with an acre of entangling kelp, notwith- </p><p>standing their effrontery. </p><p> “I’m willing to drop suit and to allow you</p><p>the hundred commission for the return of </p><p>my car.” </p><p> “Your car. Where d’ye get that stuff?</p><p>Wake up, Adolph.” </p><p> The latter’s attorney got in hurriedly on</p><p>the soft pedal. </p><p> “My client, Mr. Watkins, recognizes that</p><p>he was overhasty and ill-advised.” </p><p> “Yep, Bill,” Adolf chirped in. “You got</p><p>to allow you wasn’t doing no friendly-” </p><p> “Friendly!” blazed Bill. “It was busi-</p><p>ness. Ugh!” His hand sought his right </p><p>ear for a toothpick, then he remembered the </p><p>barbering. “Friendly! If the shoe was </p><p>on the other foot you’d be _about as friend- </p><p>ly as a ravenous coyote with a rabbit.” </p><p>Adolf muttered something about a square </p><p>deal, and put his foot right into it. </p><p> “You gave Miss Jones a square deal, eh—</p><p>you gorilla-faced piker? Have you brought </p><p>me over from the mountains to spill baby </p><p>talk? Wake up to the game you’re sitting </p><p>in on. The stakes are on the table. The </p><p>car and my commission ain’t in it at all. </p><p>I’m betting withdrawal of my suit for </p><p>damages to repitation and pecuniary loss </p><p>against your legal consent to the marriage </p><p>of Miss Alice Jones.” </p><p> Adolf howled, blustered, plead; threat-</p><p>ened all the inhumane authority of the hu- </p><p>mane and probation laws, bellowed, cursed. </p><p> Bill raised up on his toes and squinted</p><p>over the swinging doors to the bar. A </p><p>saucy toque with a lilac cluster first met his </p><p>gaze, then a pretty ear, the collar of a fur </p><p>coat and the barest tip of a pretty nose. </p><p> “Some rustler, eh?” he enthused. “Real</p><p>quick-change artist you lose there, Adolf. </p><p>Ain’t she the lady though.” </p><p> Adolf renewed his howls and bellows and</p><p>bluster. </p><p> “Well,” said Bill, “if you’re going to</p><p>take it like that there’s nothing for me </p><p>but to steal the jack-pot.” He turned to </p><p>Oppenheim. “Oppy, I’ll leave you to get </p><p>sense into his fool head, and to get him to </p><p>drive you back to Boulder.” </p><p> “Oh, he’ll see daylight when he cools off,”</p><p>the attorney prophesied. “Perhaps when </p><p>I get him to see the unpleasant position of </p><p>his friend the probation officer, in probating </p><p>a girl to a road-house he’ll see he hasn’t </p><p>much of a squeal. Good luck, Bill.” </p><p>“Attaboy!” </p><p> Bill swung out, cranked, thought to him-</p><p>self it wouldn’t be long before he had an </p><p>electric starter, sprang to the wheel and </p><p>shot away in a swirl of dust. </p><p> “There ain’t no ball nor glass slippers nor</p><p>handsome prince to this trip, Cinderella,” he </p><p>crooned softly to the little fur-cuddled, </p><p>silent figure by his side. “But I’ll show you </p><p>a bigger chunk of the world than you yet </p><p>saw, and maybe we’ll take in a show or two </p><p>and kind o’ general— Aw’, Allie, girl, say </p><p>something. I ain’t rushing you into this.” </p><p>The reply came in a half-whisper but </p><p>spirited. </p><p> “You couldn’t rush me into anything if I</p><p>wasn’t willing, Bill.” </p><p>EMLRALDi </p><p>AND </p><p>ftLOMDIt </p><p>a Complete </p><p>novj&amp;LETTE	^</p><p>61/	&amp;***</p><p>Ov' </p><p>Glady/ LJohnj'on </p><p>N THE bright lexicon of Tom </p><p>Fleming there was no such </p><p>word as moderation. It simply </p><p>didn’t exist. </p><p> Tom dwelt in a superlative world where</p><p>every child with a stomach-ache was a case </p><p>of arsenic poisoning; every poor shaver </p><p>who nicked himself during the daily </p><p>massacre, an attempted Black Hand out- </p><p>rage. The beggar who panhandled him </p><p>on the street was a foreign spy; the ol’-clo’s </p><p>man who bought his worn-out suits was a </p><p>Russian duke in exile. In other words, </p><p>Tom was the horrible by-product of the </p><p>movies. </p><p> The red-letter day of Tom’s life had been</p><p>the time he met Mullaney. Mullaney was </p><p>an honest - to - goodness detective —Tom </p><p>would have spelt that word in capital letters. </p><p>This occasion had come about when </p><p>Mullaney had dropped into the real-estate </p><p>office where Tom was employed as salesman. </p><p>Mullaney was on the trail of a gentleman </p><p>who had been over-lavish with other </p><p>people’s signatures. </p><p> After the business in hand had been</p><p>disposed of, Tom ventured the question </p><p>which had been hovering on his tongue </p><p>for minutes. </p><p> “Have a drink?”</p><p> Mullaney would, it seemed, and over a</p><p>gin fizz was confided the young man’s secret </p><p>ambition. </p><p> Mullaney bore up under the news well.</p><p>He was stoical—pessimistic even. Exam- </p><p>ining the three-star brand in his hand with </p><p>the squinted eye of a connoisseur he gave </p><p>vent to the opinion that sleuthing wasn’t</p><p>what it was cracked up to be. In fact he </p><p>spoke slightingly of the profession, the very </p><p>name of which fired Tom’s imagination to </p><p>the explosive point. But the young fellow </p><p>was not dashed. This was his chance and </p><p>he was going to grasp it. </p><p> “Honestly, I’d give most anything to</p><p>get in it,” he said earnestly. “Say, any </p><p>time you have anything sort of extra— </p><p>where you can use another man—an out- </p><p>sider, you know, tip me off. I’d be tickled </p><p>to death to do anything. I—I’ll stop at no </p><p>danger,” he added a little ashamed of the </p><p>dramatic phrasing even as it came out. </p><p> Mullaney said he’d remember it and</p><p>didn’t Tom think that they served extra- </p><p>small glasses in that place? </p><p> The funny part of it is that he did</p><p>remember it. Tom’s mental horizon was </p><p>suddenly flooded with the purple and gold </p><p>IS2 </p><p>Emeralds and Blondie </p><p>153 </p><p>of romance when he met the detective one </p><p>night upon leaving the office. The sleuth </p><p>delivered his proposition in a bored manner </p><p>which in no wise dampened the young man’s </p><p>ardor. </p><p> “Say, if you were on the level about</p><p>wanting to bust into the game as an extra </p><p>here’s something, and remember, you ain’t </p><p>offending me none if you turn it down. </p><p>Read about this Gaddis-Neville wedding </p><p>that’s coming off this evening up here at </p><p>the St. Stephen Hotel? Well, there’s going </p><p>to be a bunch of people there and they </p><p>want some men to watch the wedding </p><p>presents. They left it to me to round </p><p>them up and I thought of you. There’s </p><p>five bones in it for you if you want to take </p><p>a chance.” </p><p> If he wanted to! Tom’s heart action</p><p>increased alarmingly. Five dollars would </p><p>only pay for his laundry, to be sure—but the </p><p>color, the chance for adventure—to be a </p><p>real live detective for a night! The phleg- </p><p>matic Mr. Mullaney narrowly escaped being </p><p>hugged. </p><p> “Got a dress-suit?” was the first fly in the</p><p>ointment. </p><p> Tom’s face dropped a couple of feet.</p><p> “Oh, gee, no—but say, I can hire one!”</p><p> “That’ll do,” agreed Mullaney sadly.</p><p>“We’re to mosey around in the crush and </p><p>sorta keep an eye on things. There ain’t </p><p>really much sense to it. Nothing’ll happen; </p><p>nothing ever does. Nobody with brains </p><p>would lift the stuff they give at these </p><p>weddings, it’s tinfoil mostly, but if they’re </p><p>willing to pay, I ain’t hired to teach ’em. </p><p>You hire one of those ‘curse you’ suits </p><p>and show up at the St. Stephen at 8:30. </p><p>There’s four of us—you’ll find me in the </p><p>hall where the wedding is going to be </p><p>pulled off.” </p><p> Tom was walking on air when he and the</p><p>hired dress-suit reached the bay-windowed, </p><p>dingy gray house out on O’Farrell Street </p><p>which in sentimental moments he called </p><p>home. San Francisco is full of such houses, </p><p>left standing since “before the fire”; all</p><p>of the vintage of the ’8o’s, all relics of </p><p>broken-down-aristocracy fallen upon evil </p><p>days. Tom occupied what he flippantly </p><p>referred to as “Cell Number One”; the one- </p><p>time front parlor and kitchenette tucked </p><p>into a former clothes-closet, and officially </p><p>known as the first suite of housekeeping </p><p>rooms. </p><p> He ran up the high wooden steps and</p><p>was reaching for his latch-key when the </p><p>door was flung open and some one rushing </p><p>impetuously out collided against him with </p><p>such neatness and dispatch that the hired </p><p>dress-suit went flying down the steps behind </p><p>him. </p><p> “Ugh!" he exclaimed and was about to</p><p>add that classic advice about watching </p><p>your step when he recognized his collidee </p><p>so to speak. She was the pretty blonde </p><p>who had the rear room on the second floor. </p><p> The girl had been flung back against the</p><p>ugly wooden banister of the hall stairs, </p><p>her hat knocked over her straight little </p><p>nose and a long silky strand of hair jolted </p><p>loose from under its brim. </p><p> At any other time Tom would have</p><p>welcomed the episode. He had wanted— </p><p>unsuccessfully—to meet Helen Mercer ever </p><p>since he had seen her moving into the house </p><p>two weeks ago. Even now he forgot his </p><p>role of the cool, keen-eyed sleuth, long </p><p>enough to crush the rescued dress-suit </p><p>under his arm and say, with embarrassed </p><p>sincerity: </p><p> “Oh, I say, Miss Mercer, I’m awfully</p><p>sorry. I haven’t hurt you, have I?” </p><p> The girl tilted the broad-rimmed hat</p><p>back from her nose and caught her breath </p><p>with a little gasp. Even before she spoke, </p><p>Tom’s eyes flooded with wonder. The girl </p><p>was not only startled, as would be natural </p><p>under the circumstances, she was fearful; </p><p>her gray eyes looking out from a face gone </p><p>white with fright. </p><p> Instinctively following her gaze, Tom</p><p>saw the reason. Her heavy gray overcoat </p><p>had been hastily pulled on and left un- </p><p>buttoned. Their late encounter had flung </p><p>it open to reveal a radiant vision of a golden </p><p>dress, its top flounce looped with row upon</p><p>row of expensive pearls. It was an evening </p><p>dress—and a dress incongruous with the </p><p>modest hat and the inexpensive gray coat. </p><p> This much he saw and the girl spas-</p><p>modically jerked the coat closed and cov- </p><p>ered the telltale golden mass. Her laugh </p><p>was strained and the color still absent from </p><p>the smooth cheeks. </p><p> “No, oh, no; I’m not hurt a bit. It—it</p><p>was stupid of me but I was in a hurry and </p><p>I didn’t look before I opened the door.” </p><p> She gave him a smile, still tremulous and</p><p>fled precipitously down the outer steps, </p><p>leaving a very much perturbed and puzzled </p><p>young man looking after her. </p><p> Tom unlocked, the door of his own chilly</p><p>154 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>domain, the neglected dress-suit still </p><p>crushed under one arm. His keen young </p><p>eyes had narrowed reflectively. That as- </p><p>tute sense of the fitness of things was </p><p>whispering suspiciously to him again. Here </p><p>was an incongruity which he could not </p><p>account for. </p><p> It occupied his mind while he dressed.</p><p>What was the answer anyway, he asked </p><p>his reflection as he put on his collar before </p><p>the mirror. Why should the girl be so </p><p>startled because her coat had flown open. </p><p>Suppose he had seen her evening dress. </p><p>Lots of girls who worked wore them. Still </p><p>there was something funny about it. That </p><p>dress was no eighteen-fifty bargain prize; </p><p>even to his inexperienced eyes. </p><p> Why, the pearls alone must have cost her</p><p>a couple of hundred dollars if they went </p><p>all around the flounce in the same lavish </p><p>fashion with which they decorated the front. </p><p>If she could afford a dress like that, why </p><p>didn’t she have a hat and coat to match; </p><p>and—even more logical—why did she live </p><p>in housekeeping rooms in this dingy </p><p>O’Farrell Street house? </p><p> A glance at the alarm clock, balanced</p><p>perilously on the edge of the bureau, post- </p><p>poned the solution of this problem until a </p><p>more convenient time. It was fifteen </p><p>minutes after eight; Mullaney had said to </p><p>be there at 8:30. Pretty Helen Mercer and </p><p>her mysterious golden dress were relegated </p><p>to the background of Tom’s mind and </p><p>Detective Fleming fairly leaped into his </p><p>overcoat and ran down the steps. </p><p>H </p><p>BY 11:30 Tom was willing to </p><p>admit that the pessimistic Mullaney </p><p>was right when he ventured the </p><p>prediction that “nothing’ll happen.” Not- </p><p>withstanding the fact that he obediently </p><p>mingled with the guests and kept a con- </p><p>scientious eye on the tableful of wedding </p><p>presents, he knew in his heart that no light- </p><p>fingered gentry, who was not light-headed </p><p>at the same time, would attempt to get </p><p>away with the massive but comparatively </p><p>inexpensive silver which formed the bulk </p><p>of the gifts.</p><p> For the first couple of hours, the thought</p><p>of being there at all; at recognizing celeb- </p><p>rities who had been mere newspaper names </p><p>to him heretofore; the kaleidoscopic color, </p><p>the tintinnabulating music, the heated, </p><p>perfumed air had all served to keep his </p><p>imagination up to the romantic pitch. </p><p> Then it began to cloy. His adventurous</p><p>spirits flagged in proportion as his feet </p><p>began to hurt. The rooms seemed stuffy, </p><p>the crowd and babble about him seemed </p><p>purposeless; he didn’t blame Mullaney </p><p>for not being more enthusiastic about his </p><p>job if this was all that detecting amounted </p><p>to. Gosh, if something would only happen, </p><p>if some one would only attempt to stagger </p><p>out under the cumbersome cut-glass punch- </p><p>bowl; if the orchestra leader would only </p><p>choke the host. Even the wedding left his </p><p>imagination cold. </p><p> The bride looked nervous and stringy,</p><p>Tom decided, with the sweeping bluntness </p><p>of youth that the groom was a “big boob.” </p><p>He started to yawn as he walked for the </p><p>forty-eighth time about the room, when </p><p>some instinct within him caused him to bite </p><p>the yawn in the middle and straighten up, </p><p>much as a terrier pricks up his ears at the </p><p>first whiff of trouble. </p><p> In the further corner by the orchestra,</p><p>an agitated little knot of people had </p><p>clustered and even through the barbaric </p><p>beat of the music a woman’s voice, hyster- </p><p>ically raised, caused the dancers in her </p><p>vicinity to turn curious heads. Then he </p><p>saw her—an under-dressed stout woman, </p><p>magnificently upholstered in mauve. </p><p> Tom was starting over with all of an</p><p>Irishman’s delight in a coming row, when </p><p>he was checked by the sight of Mullaney </p><p>worming his way through the crowd toward </p><p>him. There was concern on Mullaney’s </p><p>face for the first time in the memory of man. </p><p>He drew the young man aside behind a </p><p>group of potted palms which concealed the </p><p>entrance to a small marble anteroom. </p><p> “Listen, Fleming,” the detective’s voice</p><p>was low but ominously grim, “there’s a </p><p>grand little party on and it’s up to us to </p><p>make good. Somebody’s got away with a </p><p>twenty-thousand-dollar emerald necklace.</p><p>This Chetwynd dame-” </p><p> Tom interrupted, his hazel eyes snapping</p><p>with excitement. </p><p> “The Chetwynd emeralds!”</p><p> He was making a desperate effort to</p><p>appear blase and accustomed to this sort </p><p>of thing, but in spite of himself a tremulous </p><p>delight sounded through his tone. </p><p> “Yep.” Mullaney swept on. “Seems</p><p>she had ’em up to a couple o’ minutes ago; </p><p>she remembers feeling the clasp to make sure </p><p>Emeralds and Blondie </p><p>155 </p><p>they were all right. Next thing she knew, </p><p>they were gone. Right under our noses, </p><p>too. There’s such a mob here, there’s only </p><p>one thing to do. Make every one give an </p><p>account of themselves—make sure they </p><p>got a right to be here, then search ’em. </p><p>They’ll crab their heads off too,” he inter- </p><p>jected grimly. “You watch this door— </p><p>I got men watching every other one, and </p><p>then we’ll spring the surprise party on the </p><p>crowd. If any one tries to beat it out of </p><p>here, nab ’em; they’ll be the one who </p><p>did it.” </p><p> He gave the young fellow a shove toward</p><p>the floor of the little anteroom and hurried </p><p>back to the group across the room which </p><p>had already swelled to twice its original </p><p>size and was steadily drowning out the </p><p>orchestra. </p><p> All suspicion of ennui was gone from</p><p>Tom’s manner now. He was as alert as a </p><p>bloodhound on a criminal’s trail. Some- </p><p>thing had happened at last. He was to be </p><p>an actor in a real jewel robbery. What </p><p>unbelievably good luck! </p><p> A searching glance around the anteroom</p><p>proved it empty. The miniature forest of </p><p>palms concealed it from the view of the </p><p>main ballroom; it was a pretty little am- </p><p>bush, whose marble walls, draped in Chinese </p><p>blue velvet hangings had listened to many </p><p>intimate conversations. A wicker settee, </p><p>carefully limited to two, was the only </p><p>furniture. From this little retreat a side </p><p>entrance led to the rear hall of the hotel and </p><p>fixing this door with his eyes, Tom flung </p><p>himself on the settee to follow orders. </p><p> The babble of the ballroom had grown</p><p>to a hubbub which suddenly gave way to </p><p>an ominous hush. Tom could hear the </p><p>host’s voice explaining the loss of the </p><p>emeralds, interrupted hysterically by the </p><p>excited owner of the necklace. </p><p> A guest’s voice, no doubt assisted by the</p><p>astute Mr. Mullaney rather pompously </p><p>proposed that every one be searched in </p><p>order to put their minds at rest, and offered </p><p>himself as the first candidate. </p><p> Upon this the babble broke out anew</p><p>again. Tom, his ears strained to miss no </p><p>part of this drama into which he was so </p><p>suddenly thrust, was wishing that he had </p><p>been assigned a position more in the midst </p><p>of things. He was even growing a trifle </p><p>resentful at Mullaney for putting him in this </p><p>neglected station when a stealthy footstep </p><p>outside on the marble floor caused him to </p><p>prick up his ears terrior-fashion once more, </p><p>then slip noiselessly behind an outjutting </p><p>angle of the wall. </p><p> A hand wormed whitely between the</p><p>blue curtains hanging in the archway, they </p><p>swayed apart ever so slightly and a figure </p><p>slid into the room. For a moment Tom </p><p>listened in silence to the frightened breath- </p><p>ing of the intruder; then, before the curtain </p><p>had stopped its slight swaying he stepped </p><p>out to confront the fugitive. </p><p> The surprise was fifty-fifty. He found</p><p>himself staring blankly back into the terri- </p><p>fied gray eyes of Helen Mercer. </p><p> For a long moment the young man could</p><p>do no more than fix his gaze speechlessly </p><p>on the slim golden form outlined against </p><p>the dull blue background of the curtain. </p><p>The girl’s face was chalky, so white that the </p><p>gray eyes seemed almost black in contrast </p><p>and the pupils spread nearly to the rim </p><p>of the iris. One hand was convulsively </p><p>pressed to her pounding heart crushing the- </p><p>pearls on the bodice regardlessly. </p><p> At the sight of the young man the</p><p>muscles in her throat twitched spasmod- </p><p>ically once, then she went so limp that he </p><p>was afraid she was going to faint. </p><p> “Miss Mercer! What are you doing</p><p>here?” </p><p> Tom tried to make his voice severe but</p><p>the sight of that drooping figure appealed </p><p>to him in spite of himself. </p><p> Strangely enough, after the first surprise</p><p>the recognition of the young man seemed </p><p>to brace the girl. A long, slow shudder </p><p>shook her from head to foot, then she sud- </p><p>denly galvanized into life. </p><p> “Mr. Fleming! Oh, I’m so glad it’s you.</p><p>You’ll help me, won’t you? I’ve got to </p><p>go—I’ve got to. They—they’re searching</p><p>them out there and they mustn’t find me. </p><p>You’ll let me run, won’t you, before they </p><p>find me here? I’ll explain to you tomorrow </p><p>—but I’ve got to go now.” </p><p> Even as she spoke she had run to the</p><p>deep-silled window and pulling the velvet </p><p>hanging impatiently aside had snatched up </p><p>the familiar gray coat and the broad- </p><p>rimmed hat Tom had seen her wear a few </p><p>hours ago in such different surroundings. </p><p> “Wait a minute.”</p><p> Tom’s voice checked the girl as she</p><p>frantically plunged her arms in the sleeves. </p><p> “Miss Mercer, you mustn’t do that.</p><p>Maybe you don’t know what’s the trouble, </p><p>but Mrs. Chetwynd’s emerald necklace is </p><p>156 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>gone. I’m guarding this door to see that </p><p>no one gets out. To see that the person </p><p>who stole it has no chance to escape,” he </p><p>finished, his keen eyes narrowed on the </p><p>girl’s face. </p><p> “But I didn’t take it! How could I—</p><p>I don’t even know what it looks like. I </p><p>never saw Mrs. Chetwynd until tonight. </p><p>Oh, Mr. Fleming, please, I can explain it all </p><p>but I haven’t time now and I’m afraid to </p><p>stay. I’ll meet you tomorrow, tonight— </p><p>any time you say and tell you why but I’ve </p><p>got to go now.” </p><p> She had flown to him and was tugging</p><p>at his arm, her face vivid with excitement, </p><p>her breath coming fearfully through parted </p><p>lips. In the soft radiance of the golden </p><p>dress, with her hair in silky confusion about </p><p>her upturned face she was as appealing as </p><p>a child who has been caught in mischief </p><p>and begs to be shielded. Tom’s boyish </p><p>heart almost groaned aloud. </p><p> “Miss Mercer, can’t you see what you’re</p><p>making me think if you carry on this way? </p><p>If you don’t know anything about the neck- </p><p>lace, why are you afraid of being searched?” </p><p>“Because I don’t belong here—they don’t </p><p>know me—I wasn’t invited,” the girl was in </p><p>a frenzy of impatience. </p><p> Tom continued, his soul tom in doubt.</p><p>“I wondered about you tonight, why you </p><p>had a dress like this and still lived in that </p><p>old house and how you were able to come </p><p>to a place like this—but after all, that’s </p><p>your own affair—but this: trying to run </p><p>away like this, can’t you see I mustn’t let </p><p>you do that, no matter how sorry I </p><p>am?” </p><p> “Oh, dear, I haven’t time to stop to</p><p>explain now. Mr. Fleming you must know </p><p>that I didn’t take it. You know I wouldn’t </p><p>steal anything, let alone a necklace they’d </p><p>be sure to find if I did.” </p><p> Tom was in an agony of uncertainty. It</p><p>was hard to think consecutively with that </p><p>pleading face raised to his; the eyes </p><p>shining like twin gray stars in their anxiety. </p><p>The girl’s voice sank to a little choked </p><p>whisper.</p><p> “You know I’m telling the truth. Please</p><p>let me go before it’s too late; I can explain </p><p>everything but—oh, please-” </p><p> Her body froze in sudden terror at foot-</p><p>falls outside on the marble floor and Tom </p><p>found himself forced to make a decision. </p><p> The young man’s forehead was creased</p><p>painfully. </p><p> “Oh, gee,” he burst forth, “I hate to</p><p>throw Mullaney down—but-” </p><p> A second step caused him to speak in a</p><p>rapid tone. </p><p> “Miss Mercer, did any one see you come</p><p>in here?” </p><p> “No, no, no.”</p><p> New hope had come into the girl’s eyes.</p><p>She shook her head so positively that the </p><p>pale golden mass on the top was threatened </p><p>with downfall. </p><p> “All right,” Tom exploded. “Hurry up,</p><p>before any one sees you.” </p><p> He saw the girl catch her breath in relief,</p><p>her cold little hand suddenly gripped his </p><p>and the next moment she had slipped out </p><p>the hall door. </p><p> Tom walked back to the settee fighting</p><p>an inward battle. Why did this have to </p><p>happen? To catch the real thief; that </p><p>would have been a glorious adventure; </p><p>but to have to choose for no apparent reason </p><p>between his word to Mullaney and the </p><p>chance of getting Helen Mercer in trouble— </p><p>it seemed so unnecessary. </p><p> Well, it wasn’t such a dreadful deed after</p><p>all, he told himself. The real thief would </p><p>be discovered and he would have saved the </p><p>girl from whatever indiscretion she was </p><p>afraid might be revealed. </p><p>yIT WAS nearly an hour later when </p><p>Mullaney, looking a trifle worn and </p><p>worried, entered the anteroom to </p><p>find a glum young amateur detective await- </p><p>ing him. Tom looked up eagerly.</p><p> “Well, who did it?”</p><p> Mullaney’s tone was morose. No less</p><p>morose were the faces of Pendleton Gaddis </p><p>and the owner of the necklace close behind </p><p>him. </p><p> “No luck,” snapped the detective.</p><p>“Whoever did it got away somehow. </p><p>Darned if I know how, either; every one’s </p><p>accounted for and I’ve had men guarding </p><p>every entrance. Whoever stole that neck- </p><p>lace is the slickest proposition I ever </p><p>heard of.” </p><p> His words trickled like drops of cold</p><p>water on Tom’s conscience. Then she </p><p>must have taken it; Helen Mercer with </p><p>those wide gray eyes of hers; that Appealing </p><p>innocent face and those pleading little </p><p>hands. The little cat—the little sneak— </p><p>to deliberately play on his feelings. She </p><p>must have had it all the time she was </p><p>working him for an easy fool and behind </p><p>Emeralds and Blondie </p><p>157' </p><p>those earnest eyes she was probably laugh- </p><p>ing at him. The thought was almost un- </p><p>bearable. </p><p> With one blow she had wounded the</p><p>young man in his professional pride and </p><p>in something deeper—something tenderly </p><p>protective which had leaped to life for her </p><p>that moment she had stood looking up at </p><p>him so trustingly. </p><p> Mullaney’s words broke in on the</p><p>seething indignation within him. The de- </p><p>tective’s tone was weary. Tom felt a loyal </p><p>pity for him; he knew what this would </p><p>mean to him in a professional sense. </p><p> “You didn’t see any one, did you,</p><p>Fleming? No one tried to come through?” </p><p> Even as the young man opened his lips</p><p>to reply he seemed to feel again that cold </p><p>little hand slip over his. The pleading </p><p>gray eyes floated between him and the </p><p>strained faces before him. </p><p> “You know I wouldn’t steal any-</p><p>thing-” </p><p> It was Helen’s voice, clear as a crystal in</p><p>his brain. </p><p> His fingers knotted until the veins stood</p><p>out like whip cords on the backs of his </p><p>hands. But his voice was steady when it </p><p>came. </p><p> “No, Mr. Mullaney. I haven’t seen a</p><p>soul.” </p><p>Ill </p><p>•JfS THE rear hall of the St. Stephen </p><p>Pjj] extended the entire width of the </p><p>™ building. It was seldom used, two </p><p>sets of elevators draining the influx of the </p><p>lobby and the entrance of the ballroom </p><p>giving directly upon the main hall. There </p><p>was no one in sight when the slight gray </p><p>figure slipped from the door of the ante- </p><p>room into the red-carpeted, softly lighted </p><p>vestibule. </p><p> There was a side entrance leading off</p><p>the hall, ending in a revolving glass door</p><p>for the use of those conservative guests who </p><p>preferred its semi-seclusion to the great </p><p>marble lobby and its fleet of cushion- </p><p>warmers. </p><p> It was toward this blessedly isolated</p><p>refuge that the girl now turned; then, </p><p>warned by that curious sixth sense she </p><p>flung one furtive look over her shoulder. </p><p> A figure loomed in sight down the red</p><p>vista—a tall man, coming at more than </p><p>the usual walk. The girl was filled with </p><p>sudden panic and it was by an almost </p><p>superhuman effort that she forced herself </p><p>to walk rapidly away instead of running as </p><p>her terror urged her to do. </p><p> Once around the bend in the wall, how-</p><p>ever, she broke into a run, her feet seeming </p><p>to her excited mind to drag with the horrible </p><p>lack of progress felt in some dreams. The </p><p>man turned the comer before she reached </p><p>the revolving door; still coming straight </p><p>toward her. Frantically the girl flung her- </p><p>self against the door, terrified lest he be the </p><p>house-detective already warned of the neck- </p><p>lace’s disappearance. </p><p> The cool night air rushed on her hot face</p><p>gratefully and she fairly fell down the steps; </p><p>seeing, from the corner of her eye that black </p><p>figure still coming; perilously near by now. </p><p> The street extended on each side of the</p><p>hotel, brightly lighted for blocks, and filled </p><p>with but a slight scattering of people. It </p><p>would be easy to trace a fleeing figure there. </p><p>The girl stood for a moment in agonized </p><p>indecision—then she saw her way out. </p><p> A long blue machine had pulled up beside</p><p>the curb; its engine beating sullenly while </p><p>the solitary man at the wheel lit a cigaret. </p><p>Even as its startled driver looked up the </p><p>girl was fumbling with the catch on the </p><p>front door, her words tumbling inco </p><p>herently from her lips. </p><p> “Please help me—drive me away from</p><p>here—anywhere—only be quick! I can’t </p><p>stop to explain—he’ll be here. For </p><p>Heaven’s sake, hurry—please!” </p><p> The match flickered up toward the</p><p>young man’s fingers unnoticed while he </p><p>stared open-mouthed at this latest ap-</p><p>parition. Automatically he reached over </p><p>and opened the door, but it was not until </p><p>the girl flung herself in and huddled down </p><p>on the seat beside him that he electrified </p><p>into animation. </p><p> Cigaret and match were thrown over-</p><p>board, his eyes jerked to the road ahead, </p><p>the big car, slammed into gear, squirmed </p><p>its way across the rushing traffic of Market </p><p>Street and shot up one of the dark right- </p><p>angled arteries winch lead off to the south </p><p>section of the city. </p><p> Blocks of narrow dark houses and stores</p><p>whirled by them, intersected by dismal </p><p>vacant lots—for much of this part of San </p><p>Francisco still speaks of the fire of twelve </p><p>years ago. A few lighted oases appeared— </p><p>cheap rooming-houses or all-night restau- </p><p>rants, breaking the blackness at uncertain </p><p>intervals. The city grew lonely, quiet, </p><p>gfl </p><p>158 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>spreading out into the flat, poverty- </p><p>stricken Potrero. </p><p> Only when several blocks lay between</p><p>them and brightly lighted Market Street </p><p>did the girl abandon her tense pose, con- </p><p>fident that they were not being followed. </p><p> As if sensing her relaxation, the driver</p><p>slacked the speed of the machine until he </p><p>could safely turn his head to look at her. </p><p> He was good to look at, this young man.</p><p>The elegant society favorite stamped on </p><p>him from the immaculate dress tie, visible </p><p>under the loosened black silk muffler, to </p><p>the expensive dancing pump whose polished </p><p>tip was resting on the throttle. Straight </p><p>black brows almost met over a keen, clever </p><p>nose, giving a Roman cast to his handsome </p><p>face. His black eyes were at once curious </p><p>and admiringly appraising as they rested </p><p>on the girl. </p><p>IN THE pale glare of a passing arc </p><p>light she smiled wanly up at him, </p><p>her lips tremulous with strain. </p><p>Then she drew a long breath. </p><p> “I don’t know how I’ll ever thank you,”</p><p>she began simply. “I know you’re won- </p><p>dering what in the world I’ve done. You— </p><p>you must have thought I was crazy when </p><p>I threw myself at you that way.” </p><p> “Well, I gathered that you were—</p><p>slightly impatient.” </p><p> He showed his even white teeth for a</p><p>moment. </p><p> At the raillery in his tone the girl’s eyes</p><p>dropped confusedly, then looked almost </p><p>defiantly up to meet his gaze. </p><p> “It all looks rather silly, looking back on</p><p>it now—but I was just desperate. I work </p><p>at Hoyt &amp; Brainard’s; I’m a manikin—a </p><p>fashion model. I put on expensive dresses </p><p>so that customers can see how they’ll </p><p>appear. Oh, I know—” as her glance </p><p>followed his surprised look toward the </p><p>golden flounces of the dress which showed </p><p>between the front parting of her coat— </p><p>“you’re wondering how I came to be dressed</p><p>like this and going to the St. Stephen </p><p>Hotel, when I’m only a fashion model.” </p><p>She tilted her chin up like one who </p><p>resolves to have it all over with. </p><p> “I had this dress on late this afternoon</p><p>when I was called to the telephone. We’re </p><p>not allowed to be called to the phone when </p><p>we’re on the floor but I slipped into the </p><p>booth, dress and all. I didn’t expect to </p><p>be there so long but when I came out the </p><p>closing bell was ringing. I was awfully </p><p>afraid they would be angry so I ran to the </p><p>fitting-room and tried to take it off, but it </p><p>hooks down the back and I couldn’t </p><p>reach it. </p><p> “All the girls had gone home,” she con-</p><p>tinued. “There wasn’t a soul there but </p><p>the manager of our floor and he—he’s an </p><p>old grouch.” She made a little face. “He </p><p>was angry because I was so late and I didn’t </p><p>dare tell him I’d been phoning. I tried to </p><p>take the dress off until I grew nearly des- </p><p>perate. </p><p> “He scolded me through the door and</p><p>finally I was afraid to wait any longer. I </p><p>grabbed up my long coat and flung it on— </p><p>it covered the dress all up and he never </p><p>knew I wasn’t in my own clothes when I </p><p>ran by him. I thought I could go down </p><p>to work early tomorrow and change before </p><p>any one suspected the dress was gone. </p><p> “Then, when I came home, I got to think-</p><p>ing—I knew the Gaddis-Neville wedding </p><p>was to occur tonight and I was just dying </p><p>to see it. I’d heard so much about it from </p><p>customers who came to the store and it </p><p>seemed like a Heaven-sent chance.” </p><p> She hesitated to look pleadingly into the</p><p>eyes of the man watching her so inter- </p><p>estedly. The big machine was purring </p><p>along slowly through the darkness, the </p><p>man had throttled it down to hear the </p><p>plaintive voice better. Now he smiled </p><p>encouragingly and the girl continued: </p><p> “So I went. It was such fun; no one</p><p>suspected I didn’t have a right there.” </p><p>Tom’s eyes rose accusingly in her conscience </p><p>at this, but she hurried on. “I mingled </p><p>with the crowd and a couple of men thought </p><p>they’d been introduced to me and had </p><p>forgotten my name and they danced with</p><p>me—it was fine while it lasted, then—oh, </p><p>it seemed as if my heart stood still—I heard </p><p>a fat woman talking excitedly—I heard her </p><p>saying ‘I’ve been robbed—Mr. Gaddis, my </p><p>necklace is gone—my emerald necklace,’ </p><p>and then every one got excited and I heard </p><p>a man say something about them searching </p><p>every one and making sure they had a right </p><p>to be there—oh, it was dreadful.” </p><p> The gray eyes flooded with fear at the</p><p>remembrance and in the gleam of the cowl- </p><p>light the pale gold tendrils of her hair </p><p>appeared to cling about her white face in </p><p>terror. </p><p> “And then what did you do?” the man</p><p>asked gently. </p><p>Emeralds and Blondie </p><p>159 </p><p> The girl jerked her eyes from the dark</p><p>road ahead and looked up into his face </p><p>again. </p><p> “I ran away. I know it made me look</p><p>guilty but don’t you see—I didn’t dare say </p><p>who I was—they’d dismiss me at the store </p><p>for daring to wear a dress out of there and </p><p>I’d never get another position in San </p><p>Francisco. I was out of work once and </p><p>I was afraid—afraid-” </p><p> Her voice died to a whisper then she</p><p>appeared to give herself a mental shake and </p><p>took a fresh start: </p><p> “I ran away before they could search me,”</p><p>she glossed over Tom’s breach of faith with </p><p>a grateful little reservation. “But as I </p><p>was going down the hall, I saw a man </p><p>walking quickly toward me, I was afraid </p><p>I was followed and when I saw your car </p><p>I thought only of getting away.” </p><p> Impulsively she leaned closer to the man,</p><p>whose gaze enveloped her with a half- </p><p>amused tenderness. Her eyes were almost </p><p>tragically grateful as she looked up at him. </p><p> “Oh, I don’t know how to thank you—</p><p>it would have been so dreadful for me. I </p><p>can’t tell you how grateful I-” </p><p> She stopped, suddenly aware of some</p><p>subtle change in her companion. His face </p><p>appeared to have slipped on a wooden mask, </p><p>the black eyes narrowed, looking intently </p><p>at the flounce of the troublesome golden </p><p>dress. </p><p> Instinctively the girl's gaze followed his</p><p>and her lips parted in a gasp. Green and </p><p>wicked in the glare of the cowl-light; seem- </p><p>ing to coruscate with diabolical glee at each </p><p>slight vibration of the machine, swung </p><p>the two stolen emeralds. Only their odd </p><p>square setting and a tiny strand of the </p><p>golden chain was visible, and that merely </p><p>because some impetuous movement on the </p><p>girl’s part had disarranged the upper </p><p>flounce of the gold gown. It was a careless </p><p>chance which had shown them to the man— </p><p>when she was standing up the overlapping</p><p>flounce of the dress would conceal them. </p><p> The silence which followed seemed heavy,</p><p>the humming of the motor beat in the girl’s </p><p>ears as a muffled roar. The man’s words </p><p>seemed physical blows on her conscious- </p><p>ness: </p><p> “Pretty slick; pret-ty slick. You nearly</p><p>got away with it, sister, but not quite— </p><p>and that’s where I come in. Don’t make </p><p>any mistake, ‘Blondie,’ this is a fifty-fifty </p><p>job.” </p><p>IV </p><p>WttJB IT WAS a full minute before the </p><p>girl spoke, in a queer, choked tone. </p><p> “Why—how did that get</p><p>there-” </p><p> She reached over and raising the golden</p><p>flounce released the clasp of the necklace </p><p>from the mesh of pearls which interlaced it. </p><p> As the smooth, cool stones slipped</p><p>through her fingers, a thousand varying </p><p>shades of green shot through the gems. </p><p>They seemed alternately to pale and flush </p><p>with color, like living things, now filled </p><p>with the clear, transparent green of sun- </p><p>light seen through sea-water; now richly </p><p>dark, almost black in their deep hearts. </p><p>Twin emeralds—no Uralian stones these, </p><p>nor yet the Brazilian emeralds, which are </p><p>mere green tourmalin; but the perfect </p><p>Oriental emerald, sisters to those marvelous </p><p>gems mined long ago from the hot sands of </p><p>Jebel Zabara that they might glow royally </p><p>against Cleopatra’s black hair. </p><p> For the first time the girl seemed to grasp</p><p>the enormity of the theft. She raised </p><p>fascinated eyes to the man beside her. </p><p> At the sight of the jewels, a tense watch-</p><p>fulness had supplanted the boyish poise </p><p>of the driver. The handsome black eyes </p><p>had narrowed, filled with an amusement </p><p>which appeared sinister to the girl’s terrified </p><p>gaze. </p><p> He showed his fine white teeth in a silent</p><p>laugh. </p><p> “The game’s played out, Blondie, can’t</p><p>you see it? You did some pretty keen</p><p>work—why you almost had me fooled there </p><p>for a time. Lord, oh, Lord, won’t Cleete </p><p>and the boys appreciate this!” </p><p> He went off into a silent fit of laughter.</p><p> The girl had shrunk to the side of the</p><p>seat, the stones allowed to slide together </p><p>carelessly in her lap. </p><p> “What do you mean?” but she asked it</p><p>automatically, as one on whom a light is </p><p>breaking. </p><p> “Oh, Lord, oh. Lord!”</p><p> Her simple question seemed to afford</p><p>even greater amusement to the man. Then </p><p>his manner suddenly changed. He straight- </p><p>ened up severely. </p><p> “Look here, Blondie; don’t over-act or</p><p>you’ll begin to bore me. You might as well </p><p>make up your mind to split three ways on </p><p>this job. Yourself—me and Cleete. </p><p>Maybe you could have gotten away with it </p><p>i6o </p><p>Adventure </p><p>if you hadn’t stumbled on my car—say </p><p>that was the richest yet—but you’re no fool. </p><p>You must realize you couldn’t get rid of </p><p>that thing this side of the Rockies at least, </p><p>without coming through to Cleete. This </p><p>playing a lone hand may go back East, </p><p>but remember, you’re spotted easier out </p><p>here. There aren’t so many of us and if </p><p>we begin backbiting and double-crossing— </p><p>well,” he finished with grim humor, “there’ll </p><p>be still less.” </p><p> “But I don’t understand,” insisted the</p><p>girl. She had conquered her first terror </p><p>and her eyes met the man’s almost de- </p><p>fiantly. “I was telling you the truth. I </p><p>don’t know how I got the necklace and </p><p>what’s more, I don’t know how I’ll give it </p><p>back without them finding at the store that </p><p>I wore the dress-” </p><p> “Take off your hat,” the man suddenly</p><p>ordered. </p><p> There was an expression in his eyes which</p><p>prompted the girl to obey hastily. </p><p> With the broad-brimmed hat away, a</p><p>mass of golden hair toppled on to her </p><p>shoulders. It was hair which would be </p><p>noticeable anywhere, a crown for a princess. </p><p>Fine silky strands of a peculiar metallic </p><p>luster, the pale hue of virgin gold; with an </p><p>odd frosty fight in the loose waves. </p><p> The man took a strand in his hand,</p><p>apparently unaware that the girl shrank </p><p>involuntarily away; and examined it in- </p><p>tently. When he looked up again his eyes </p><p>were mocking. </p><p> “Cut the comedy, Blondie. You’re cer-</p><p>tainly as slick as they say you are, but get </p><p>it through your head that the game’s </p><p>played out.” </p><p> A thrill of combined fear and anger</p><p>shook the girl but by a desperate effort </p><p>she controlled her voice. </p><p> “I’ve told you the truth, I don’t know</p><p>what you mean by ‘Cleete.’ You don’t </p><p>think I deliberately took that necklace, </p><p>do you?” </p><p> The man turned to her sharply as one</p><p>would to an ill-bred persistent child. </p><p> “Of course not. I believe in fairies—</p><p>they hooked it into your skirt, that’s all. </p><p>Now look here, Blondie, it was told around </p><p>the club that you were coming from the </p><p>East. We’re prepared to welcome you all </p><p>right, but you’ve got to understand that </p><p>every game you play out West here, Cleete </p><p>stands in on. We back each other up, </p><p>Blondie, because we have to. It’s safer.” </p><p>His words seemed to hold a double meaning. </p><p>“You can’t buck the combination; it’s </p><p>bigger than you are.” </p><p> For a moment the big car hummed along</p><p>silently, then the man spoke again. </p><p> “That was clever stuff you pulled in</p><p>Mobile; and the Mardi Gras business in </p><p>New Orleans—after seeing you I think you </p><p>could do bigger work than this trinket- </p><p>lifting,” with a half-contemptuous glance </p><p>at the glowing green in the girl’s lap, “but </p><p>having the system is only half the battle </p><p>out here; you’ve got to have the club </p><p>behind you and God help you if you double- </p><p>cross Cleete!” </p><p> As he finished speaking, the machine</p><p>suddenly leaped into life and spurted down </p><p>the San Bruno Road, a lonely highway </p><p>following the shore-line of the back bay, </p><p>winding past railroad yards, tanneries and </p><p>dismal, straggling little farms worked by </p><p>Italians and Portuguese. </p><p> To the girl’s frantic pleading the man</p><p>gave one curt reply. </p><p> “We’re going to the club.”</p><p> At San Bruno, the blue car turned again</p><p>into the main highway purring down to </p><p>the conservative thirty miles an hour gait. </p><p>Other machines whizzed by them. More </p><p>than one indulgent smile was thrown their </p><p>way as cars caught up, jogged alongside </p><p>for a brief moment then darted ahead. A </p><p>good-looking young man in evening clothes </p><p>and a pretty girl—it was only too evident </p><p>they were taken for a couple of sweethearts </p><p>on a lark. Twice the girl narrowly stifled </p><p>the scream for help which rose in her throat, </p><p>only to remember in time, the damning </p><p>evidence in her hand.</p><p> The clock dial pointed to midnight; still</p><p>die blue machine hummed along, never </p><p>sinking below the thirly-an-hour point, yet </p><p>never exceeding it. It was evident that </p><p>the astute young man at the wheel was </p><p>running no chance of being “pinched” with </p><p>its attendant embarrassing explanations. </p><p> Tree-shaded Burlingame rushed by, then</p><p>San Mateo; nearly dark at this hour. It </p><p>was only when the machine swerved from </p><p>the smooth asphalt of the highway and </p><p>turned west on a bumpy dirt road that the </p><p>girl became watchfully alert again. </p><p> An old picket fence, its whitewash flaked</p><p>off in great patches suddenly sprang up on </p><p>the edge of the road. A few seconds later </p><p>they slowed before a semi-circular iron gate </p><p>surmounted by two old-fashioned iron </p><p>Emeralds and Blondie </p><p>161 </p><p>lamps, once marvels of workmanship, but </p><p>now corroded and unlit. Unseen mechan- </p><p>ism, worked by the wheels of the car passing </p><p>over an iron plate in the ground, swung </p><p>the great gates slowly inward and they </p><p>rolled up a long avenue of. gloomy euca- </p><p>lyptus trees. </p><p> The girl was leaning forward in the seat</p><p>now, her hands tightly clenched, her eyes </p><p>wide. The place was evidently a fair-sized </p><p>rather shiftlessly worked farm. In the </p><p>moonlit patches between the trees she could </p><p>see small regular hay piles, casting round- </p><p>topped black shadows seemingly as solid as </p><p>themselves. Two straggling rows of vege- </p><p>tables, artichokes, apparently, kept pace </p><p>with the driveway. </p><p>AT THE end of the gravel drive, a </p><p>patch of eucalyptus, containing a </p><p>house, loomed squarely in their way. </p><p>A gaunt high house, built in the gloomy </p><p>style of the ’50’s, with tortuous scrollwork </p><p>emphasizing each high blank window and </p><p>outlining the deep narrow doorway. </p><p> A Spanish veranda ran the width of the</p><p>upper story, its perpendicular railings em- </p><p>phasized by the moonlight so grotesquely </p><p>that it took on the appearance of grinning. </p><p> The gravel driveway led to the front</p><p>steps, broad and shallow, then swept semi- </p><p>circularly around and disappeared in the </p><p>rear. The whole effect was deserted. One </p><p>of the high windows which looked out each </p><p>side of the door, was entirely boarded up, </p><p>from within; the glass panes of the other </p><p>glistened blankly in the moonlight. </p><p> At the sinister appearance of the house</p><p>the girl’s face went white and she seized </p><p>the door with a half-formed idea of leaping </p><p>out and taking her chance in a foot-race </p><p>between the trees. Before this plan could </p><p>harden into resolution the blue car had </p><p>swept around to the rear of the place. </p><p> Here the trees pressed so closely on the</p><p>building that their rustling branches scraped </p><p>the wooden veranda overhead which dupli- </p><p>cated the one in front. </p><p> The machine abruptly slowed, then</p><p>stopped. The driver killed the engine and </p><p>turned to the tense girl beside him. </p><p> “All right, Blondie, now, if you’ll be so</p><p>kind as to step out-” </p><p> He reached over and unfastened the</p><p>catch on the door, not appearing to notice </p><p>the girl’s involuntary shrinking as his sleeve </p><p>brushed her knees. Mutely she obeyed </p><p>him. Her necklace was gripped convul- </p><p>sively in her hand until the settings cut </p><p>into the palm. </p><p> The two shallow steps which led to the</p><p>porch were ankle-deep with drifted euca- </p><p>lyptus leaves. Everything spoke of the </p><p>greatest desolation. </p><p> The man put his hand under the girl’s</p><p>elbow courteously to help her to the porch— </p><p>his manner was irreproachable, they might </p><p>have been at the St. Stephen. Even in the </p><p>tension of the moment, the girl was cogniz- </p><p>ant of the startling picture they must make. </p><p>The moon sifting through the trees cast </p><p>black shadows on the porch below. It </p><p>traced the young man’s profile against the </p><p>dark background of the door with cameo- </p><p>like clearness, the black meeting arch of his </p><p>eyebrows causing him to appear more </p><p>Roman warrior-like than ever. </p><p> The white front of his dress-shirt gleamed</p><p>beneath the loosened muffler and the un- </p><p>buttoned overcoat. He stood with his </p><p>head bent slightly to one side as though </p><p>listening intently, the while his knuckles </p><p>beat a careless tattoo as one will do with </p><p>a mind half-abstracted from the business </p><p>in hand. Under his breath, as though by </p><p>chance, he was whistling the opening bars </p><p>of “La Paloma,” slightly prolonging the </p><p>plaintive minor notes. </p><p> The girl had shrunk against the rickety</p><p>balustrade of the porch, her fascinated </p><p>gaze fixed on the man’s profile. In the </p><p>white flood of moonlight her hair took on </p><p>a frosty light, almost unearthly so pale </p><p>gold did it become. Her deep-set gray eyes </p><p>became almost black in the shadow. Li </p><p>the gap of her coat the telltale gleam </p><p>of the golden dress flashed out, the sewn </p><p>pearls gleaming opalescently as though </p><p>claiming kinship with the moonlight. </p><p> Twice the young man tapped in seeming</p><p>indifference, but the astute gaze of the </p><p>girl saw his head bend even closer and his </p><p>brows became one unbroken line in impa- </p><p>tience. The house apparently remained as </p><p>deserted as before. Then, although she </p><p>had heard no noise, the girl was startlingly </p><p>aware that other eyes were upon them. </p><p> Without changing her position in the</p><p>slightest she shifted her eyes from the man’s </p><p>face to the left side of the door. The door- </p><p>frame was a mass of intricate carving. </p><p>Even as she looked the wind swayed a </p><p>branch of the complaining eucalyptus and </p><p>the moonlight flooded the porch. </p><p>Adventure </p><p> It was only for a breath’s space but long</p><p>enough for the girl to see that a portion </p><p>of the door-jamb was missing—a narrow </p><p>slot about six inches by two between a </p><p>couple of clumsy scrolls. Where it had </p><p>been the moon glistened upon the whites </p><p>of two eyes silently regarding them. Black </p><p>eyes, like two beady shoe-buttons, stuck in </p><p>the door-jamb. </p><p> The girl smothered the scream that rose</p><p>in her throat, but the palms of her hands </p><p>went cold and wet. There was something </p><p>so sinister in that silent, unblinking scrutiny </p><p>that the girl, sick with terror, was reaching </p><p>for the man’s arm when the eyes vanished </p><p>and the missing portion of woodwork </p><p>reappeared. </p><p>V </p><p>THE door swung slowly inward. </p><p>The room was velvet black, save </p><p>where the moon sought out chinks </p><p>closed shutters and pointed long </p><p>fingers through them to fall in </p><p>splinters on the bare floor. As the man and </p><p>girl stepped over the threshold a match </p><p>flared up, to show them a dark-faced man </p><p>touching it to the wick of a kerosene lamp. </p><p> He replaced the chimney on the lamp</p><p>and taking it in his hand turned toward </p><p>them, his grotesque black shadow suddenly </p><p>leaping up the wall behind him until it shot </p><p>half-way across the shadowy ceiling. </p><p> In the swift, shrinking glance the girl</p><p>flung about the room she saw nothing more </p><p>than might have been expected from the </p><p>outside of the house. A stove, red with </p><p>rust, and propped under one rickety leg </p><p>with bricks, occupied one corner. A wood- </p><p>box, half-filled, grew on the eye out of the </p><p>shadows. From rude shelves, visible in the </p><p>wavering dusk came the metallic gleam </p><p>of pots and pans. Three old and scarred </p><p>rush-bottomed chairs intruded themselves </p><p>in the flickering radius of the lamplight. </p><p> The tenant himself bore out the general</p><p>appearance—a Portuguese farmer from the </p><p>silent evidence of his soiled checked shirt </p><p>and the mud-spattered trousers. </p><p> No words passed between the two men.</p><p>It was evident that this scene had become</p><p>so commonplace as to be undeserving of </p><p>comment. The Portuguese held the lamp </p><p>slightly aloof and walked ahead of them </p><p>to a door which gradually became visible </p><p>as the light moved across the bare room. </p><p> The other man turned to his companion</p><p>courteously. </p><p> “Straight ahead, Blondie, if you please.”</p><p> For a brief moment the girl fought a</p><p>loathing to venture further in that house </p><p>of mystery, then, realizing how little good </p><p>objection would do her, she nervously </p><p>moistened her dry lips and followed the </p><p>will-o’-the-wisp of light. </p><p> The Portuguese had started down a long</p><p>hall as bleak and dark as the kitchen had </p><p>been, his heavy-soled boots making a </p><p>hideous clamor on the uncarpeted floor. </p><p> Midway up the hall he paused and</p><p>opening a door, stood aside to let them </p><p>enter. </p><p> The girl caught her breath audibly.</p><p>The sudden contrast was startling, even </p><p>dramatic. It was a room magically con- </p><p>jured out of Monte Cristo’s palace and </p><p>fitted up with the same kingly magnificence. </p><p>The walls themselves were ebony—ebony </p><p>inlaid with the milky whiteness of mother- </p><p>of-pearl. Even the floor was of the same </p><p>dark wood, polished until it shone like the </p><p>back of a Maratta shield. And this black </p><p>splendor was merely the casket to make </p><p>more marvelous the jewels it held. </p><p> By contrast the rugs on the floor ap-</p><p>peared to glow; rugs, which even to a </p><p>novice proclaimed their priceless lineage. </p><p>No tawdry imitations these, anilin-dyed </p><p>and acid-washed to deceive the infidel; </p><p>but silk rugs from Persia, made in the </p><p>golden age of rugs, their pile but lightly </p><p>worn and their mellow colors still unfaded </p><p>though five centuries had passed since slim </p><p>brown fingers had tied the Sehna knots. </p><p> In the amber light of the hanging lamps</p><p>above them their blue hearts seemed to </p><p>pulsate with the very intensity of color, </p><p>with the old lost Persian blue. The leafy </p><p>scrolls—for they were not of the pattern </p><p>of the Sunni, that austere Mohammedan </p><p>sect, but reflected instead the freer Shiah as</p><p>could be seen by the topaz cartouches en- </p><p>closing Kufic inscriptions—appeared to </p><p>sway as though stirred to life by a miracu- </p><p>lous wind. </p><p> Nor was this all; the eye wandered be-</p><p>yond the seven mica-shaded lamps swinging </p><p>from the shadowy ceiling; strayed by the </p><p>throne-like chairs of ebony, fascinating </p><p>by reason of the unrelieving black velvet </p><p>cushions which turned them into sil- </p><p>houettes; and lingered enthralled upon the </p><p>vases which surrounded the room and </p><p>11 </p><p>in the </p><p>white </p><p>Emeralds and Blondie </p><p>163 </p><p>gleamed jewel-like out of the mellow dusk. </p><p>Here even the kindling shades of the rugs </p><p>were outdone; the effect was a symphony </p><p>in color—and such color as only an artist </p><p>De Quincey might dream. </p><p> Pale jasper over carved gold; ruby;</p><p>sapphire; transparent violet over white, </p><p>seme with golden stars; the glorious con- </p><p>trast of purple and cobalt over foil and the </p><p>deeper notes of ivory, black and orange— </p><p>the matchless enamel of priceless cloisonnc. </p><p> Even before she noticed the occupants of</p><p>the room the girl drank the background </p><p>in; not even her fear sufficing to deaden </p><p>her amazement. Then she became aware </p><p>that two men had ceased their low-toned </p><p>conversation and, quietly alert, were re- </p><p>garding her from the depths of the cush- </p><p>ioned chairs. </p><p> Her companion nodded carelessly to one;</p><p>greeted the other, wrapped in a dark green </p><p>silk lounging robe with a casual, “How are </p><p>you, Clieve?” and, still steering the girl </p><p>before him, advanced to meet a figure </p><p>which now appeared between two heavy </p><p>velvet curtains across the large room. </p><p> “A little surprise for you, Cleete,” he</p><p>spoke lightly, but there was a certain defer- </p><p>ence in his manner which did not escape </p><p>the girl. “We have in our midst, Blondie, </p><p>accompanied by the Chetwynd emeralds.” </p><p> In spite of the perilous position in which</p><p>she found herself the girl’s eyes widened </p><p>in surprise as they took in the small, almost </p><p>pudgy figure, the pale-colored hair, and the </p><p>mild inquiring blue eyes behind the thick </p><p>glasses. That this was the cleverest “fence” </p><p>on the Pacific coast seemed ridiculous. He </p><p>might have been a divinity student, in- </p><p>advertently wandered into an exclusive </p><p>gentlemen’s club and a trifle incongruous </p><p>with his surroundings. His manner of </p><p>greeting the girl heightened this impression. </p><p>He turned again to the man. </p><p> “Didn’t expect you tonight, Treviflion.</p><p>Croix was in about an hour ago, looking </p><p>for you.” </p><p> Trevillion laughed.</p><p> “Ij expected to meet him but ran into</p><p>Blondie instead. The story’s too good to </p><p>keep.” </p><p> He started to laugh again, then, in reply</p><p>to Cleete’s mildly inquiring look he related </p><p>the circumstances of the meeting. </p><p> When he finished he looked again at the</p><p>girl, from narrow, amused eyes. </p><p> “Going to ’fess up, Blondie, and admit</p><p>that you were trying to deceive the hand- </p><p>some stranger?” </p><p> The girl’s face had gone deathly white,</p><p>a fine little dew had sprung out on her </p><p>forehead and beaded her upper lip, but her </p><p>amused laugh rang true. </p><p> “You’ve got me all right, but really,</p><p>you didn’t think 1 was going to open my </p><p>heart to the first kind man who gave me </p><p>an auto ride, did you? I knew you recog- </p><p>nized me as Blondie—it was my hair did </p><p>the trick, wasn’t it—but you see I wasn’t </p><p>so sure of you. I thought you were playing </p><p>a lone hand and just bluffing about the </p><p>club and—and Cleete.” </p><p> She faltered a trifle over the name, then</p><p>rushed on. </p><p> “I thought you were working it to get</p><p>the emeralds for yourself and I was going </p><p>to call your bluff. You don’t suppose that </p><p>I pulled that Mobile business and the </p><p>Boston game you mentioned by giving up </p><p>the stuff to the first person who hailed me </p><p>by my name!” </p><p> Trevillion was entranced.</p><p> “It was worth a million to watch you</p><p>work it, Blondie. Why really, she had me </p><p>guessing there at the first.” </p><p> He turned to his chief.</p><p>BUT the other man was not dis- </p><p>posed to follow his lead. A sur- </p><p>prising change had come over him. </p><p>As Trevillion had related with glee the </p><p>girl’s protestations of innocence, Cleete </p><p>had transferred his gaze to her and she now </p><p>raised her eyes to receive the full force of</p><p>his stare. His face wore an expression she </p><p>had not deemed him capable of, the heavy </p><p>lids of his eyes were rolled back and the </p><p>irises, rather terrifyingly enlarged by the </p><p>lenses of the glasses, belched forth a steady </p><p>blue flame. For the first time the girl </p><p>sensed the innate power of the man. </p><p> His voice, too, was as crisp as the snap-</p><p>ping of dried twigs. </p><p> “None of that, Blondie. You’ve got to</p><p>fall in line on this coast. I figured you’d </p><p>try something like this; so did Riddle. </p><p>He said you’d try to play a lone hand when </p><p>he tipped me off that you were coming.” </p><p>The threat in his tone was only half- </p><p>veiled. The girl’s face went a shade whiter </p><p>and she interrupted half-hysterically: </p><p>“But I didn’t, I didn’t! I was going to </p><p>come here to—to split on the emeralds, </p><p>but I wasn’t sure of Trevillion. How did </p><p>164 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>I know he wasn’t a cop trying to bluff me </p><p>into admitting who I was? Of course when </p><p>he really brought me here I knew it was </p><p>all right, but I wasn’t going to admit any- </p><p>thing until I was dead sure.” </p><p> Trevillion’s black eyes regarded her</p><p>admiringly. </p><p> “That’s good logic, Cleete. If Blondie</p><p>wasn’t clever enough to watch her step, </p><p>she couldn’t pull the stuff she does.” </p><p> The blue flame had died from the chief’s</p><p>eyes and he grunted noncommittally. </p><p> “All right, but in case Riddle didn’t tip</p><p>you off before you left the East, I will. </p><p>This club isn’t founded for sheerly social </p><p>purposes—” with deep sarcasm—“it’s for </p><p>mutual protection and remember whatever </p><p>you pull on this coast, the club stands in on. </p><p>There aren’t the big cities here that there </p><p>are back East and it’s harder to dispose of </p><p>the stuff. If you’re square with the club, </p><p>the club will stand behind you and—another </p><p>little tip, Blondie—you’ll need the club </p><p>before you get through. The East was </p><p>getting pretty hot for you and in the West </p><p>they’ll spot you sooner. Don’t forget </p><p>which side your bread is buttered on. </p><p>No one has ever double-crossed me—yet.” </p><p>The last words would have been reas- </p><p>suring, but something sinister lurked behind </p><p>the ominously quiet tone. It left the girl’s </p><p>fascinated eyes on Cleete’s face, her tongue </p><p>cleaving to the roof of her mouth. Nor </p><p>could she speak nor look away until he </p><p>chose to remove his gaze. </p><p> “Now then, the emeralds,” the man held</p><p>out his hand imperiously. </p><p> Still under that hypnotic blue stare, the</p><p>girl meekly pulled them out of her pocket </p><p>and dropped them into his outstretched </p><p>palm. </p><p> The man barely glanced at them. Their</p><p>glorious green splendor might have been </p><p>so much putty from the contemptuous </p><p>manner in which his fingers closed over </p><p>them. He led the way to the small room </p><p>beyond. But for Trevillion’s courteous </p><p>clasp on her arm, the girl would have stood</p><p>rooted to the spot, like a disciplined child, </p><p>too terrified to move. </p><p> The small room was devoted almost</p><p>entirely to a large round safe. Like the </p><p>other it was lit by the same mica-shaded </p><p>lamps. There were no windows in either </p><p>room. It was evident that only the heart </p><p>of the house was thus lavishly furnished, </p><p>for through the space of a velvet curtain, </p><p>the girl could catch a glimpse of a barren </p><p>room beyond, gray with dust, the room </p><p>of the boarded-up window. </p><p> When the Chetwynd emeralds had been</p><p>flung loosely in the safe and the heavy door </p><p>swung to on them, Cleete turned about. </p><p>The fire had faded from his heavy-lidded </p><p>eyes but a grim little line still ran about </p><p>his mouth. </p><p> “This is a three-way split. It may be a</p><p>month before I’ll have a chance to get in </p><p>touch with Riddle on this thing. Of course </p><p>if you want any money advanced-” </p><p> “No!” the girl almost gasped it. “I—I</p><p>have enough to get by on.” </p><p> The chief shrugged and became almost</p><p>miraculously the inoffensive, pudgy little </p><p>figure he had first appeared. But the </p><p>terror of that fierce revealment was still </p><p>upon the girl and her relief, as Cleete left </p><p>them and went out to the other room to </p><p>meet a newcomer, was apparent to the </p><p>amused Trevillipn. </p><p> “Rather crimped you, didn’t he,</p><p>Blondie?” </p><p> He steered her reluctant steps to the large</p><p>room again and indicated a chair. </p><p> For a brief moment the girl hesitated,</p><p>casting a frightened look toward the door; </p><p>then, as if the strength had suddenly gone </p><p>out of them, her legs crumpled beneath her </p><p>and she sank into the chair. </p><p> Trevillion flung himself into the one</p><p>opposite where his evening clothes promptly </p><p>merged into the background of the velvet </p><p>cushions, leaving him merely a white shirt </p><p>front and a detached face rather horribly </p><p>swimming in a pool of blackness.</p><p> “That’s the one thing that blights</p><p>Cleete’s young life,” he explained lightly. </p><p>“Any one slipping anything over on him,” </p><p>in answer to the girl’s inquiring look. </p><p>“Cleete’s square; we know we can trust </p><p>him and he makes us play quite as fair. </p><p>He’s right, too. It’s only cooperation </p><p>that has enabled us to play our games as </p><p>long and as safely as we have.” </p><p> He interrupted another nervous glance</p><p>the girl was stealing toward the door and </p><p>his voice grew a trifle sharp. </p><p> “Don’t lose your nerve, Blondie, merely</p><p>because of a little disciplining on Cleete’s </p><p>part. If this shakes you I don’t see how </p><p>you got away with that Mobile stuff.” </p><p> His words acted as a tonic on the girl.</p><p>She suddenly jerked her eyes back to his </p><p>and forced a laugh. </p><p>Emeralds and Blondie </p><p>165 </p><p> “You want to remember I’m not used</p><p>to him. I had no idea a person could </p><p>change so—appear two such separate </p><p>people-” </p><p> Trevillion nodded, as if she had scored.</p><p>“It’s rather uncanny, Doctor Jekyll and </p><p>Mr. Hyde effect—Cleete’s a strange man. </p><p>I wouldn’t take a chance on double-crossing </p><p>him for the Kohinoor itself. I don’t blame </p><p>you though, for making the attempt—oh, </p><p>don’t be afraid that I’m going to give you </p><p>away,” at the girl’s involuntary start of </p><p>surprise. “I knew you were trying to get </p><p>clean with the emeralds, but really it isn’t </p><p>safe, Blondie. Cleete would have got you </p><p>in the end. </p><p> “Maybe Riddle didn’t explain enough</p><p>about us. We’re unique—oh, there are </p><p>gangs, of course, but we’re more than a </p><p>gang. We work the thing scientifically, </p><p>or better yet, on business methods. Big </p><p>stuff is all we bother with. And we special- </p><p>ize too. I do society—the same as you. </p><p>Croix does the races, the stock game and </p><p>anything where good-fellowship comes into </p><p>play. That chap, Clieve, I spoke to as we </p><p>came in,” he nodded toward the man in </p><p>the silk lounging-robe, “does the foreign </p><p>minister stuff; he’s a wonder at worming </p><p>himself into diplomatic circles. </p><p> “We’ve got it down fine and that’s why</p><p>we’re so safe. There’s never anything crude </p><p>pulled; none of our finger-prints are hang- </p><p>ing around as art studies for zealous young </p><p>detectives to memorize. Cleete receives </p><p>the stuff and in due course we get the </p><p>money. I don’t know how he gets rid </p><p>of it.” He shrugged, a movement almost </p><p>invisible against the cushions. “I don’t </p><p>know—none of us know. It’s none of our </p><p>business when you come down to it, so long </p><p>as we get our share.” </p><p>“But this—” The girl broke in hoarsely. </p><p>The effort she was making to hold up her </p><p>end of the conversation was evident. By </p><p>main will she kept her longing glance from </p><p>straying toward the door again. </p><p> “I—I never thought—I never saw—</p><p>crooks—in a place like this.”</p><p> Trevillion laughed silently, his black</p><p>eyes narrowed to slits in his amusement </p><p>until his face was like a sharp white mask. </p><p> “Cleete’s idea—the club; and crooks—</p><p>really, Blondie, I wish you wouldn’t offend </p><p>my sensibilities! Gentlemen adventurers, </p><p>if you don’t mind. Kipling knew—‘We’re </p><p>poor little lambs who have lost our way; </p><p>we’re little black sheep who have gone </p><p>astray.’ While some of us may have </p><p>reached this dizzy height via the second- </p><p>story route, we pride ourselves on being </p><p>esthetic. Nothing less than ten thousand </p><p>for a job—it really doesn’t pay by the time </p><p>you split with Cleete.” </p><p> “What’s Cleete in it for?” The girl</p><p>fired the question at him sharply. “It </p><p>isn’t for the money only is it? Look at the </p><p>way he handled the emeralds.” </p><p>t" ' TREVILLION gave her a com- </p><p> mendatory glance.</p><p> J “You hit it, Blondie. Not the</p><p>money—that is, for the money’s sake. He </p><p>doesn’t give a hang about it; it’s to gratify </p><p>his one passion.” </p><p> Trevillion was perfectly serious now;</p><p>it was evident that the peculiar character </p><p>of Cleete had taken possession of his imag- </p><p>ination strongly. </p><p> “All men have some main passion in life.</p><p>With some it’s women—it’s drink with </p><p>some, or making money, but Cleete doesn’t </p><p>care for a red cent. It’s cloisonne vases </p><p>with him. Heaven knows where he gets </p><p>them, but he spends thousands on a little </p><p>piece of enamel no bigger than your fist. </p><p>Says it’s the highest expression of art. I </p><p>believe he’d commit murder for a bit of </p><p>ware he’d set his heart upon.” </p><p> The man’s matter-of-fact tone chilled the</p><p>girl; but her nervous tremor went un- </p><p>noticed by Trevillion, who had turned to </p><p>hail the chief as he passed behind their </p><p>chairs. </p><p> “I’m telling Blondie about your vases,”</p><p>he explained as easily as if this was a casual </p><p>ballroom conversation. </p><p> Now the heavy lids were rolled back but</p><p>this time the eyes were wide with interest. </p><p>The fanatical gleam of the connoisseur </p><p>burned in Cleete’s gaze. His other purpose </p><p>was instantly forgotten and he lingered by </p><p>their chairs. </p><p> “Hundreds of them,” he waved his hand</p><p>toward the rich gleam of the vases visible </p><p>through the amber-shaded gloom, “and </p><p>every one a gem. Crisaille, basse-taille— </p><p>oh, a perfect example of that, the gold most </p><p>exquisitely carved—champleve enamel too, </p><p>but mostly cloisonne. That is what I am </p><p>focusing on. I have them all, perfect </p><p>examples of the rare tourquoise blue and </p><p>one vase of vesica-shaped medallions which </p><p>rivals the pala d’oro of St. Marks.” </p><p>166 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> The girl’s eyes were fixed fascinated on</p><p>his transfigured face though his words were </p><p>as so many empty sounds to her ears. The </p><p>pudgy features, through some trick of </p><p>expression had suddenly become elongated; </p><p>they were sharp, ravenous even—the look </p><p>of a wolf on the trail. </p><p> “Look at this!”</p><p> His voice was tremulous with intense</p><p>feeling; the hand which had flung two </p><p>matchless emeralds so carelessly into the </p><p>safe, now reverently displayed the six-inch </p><p>vase in his hand. </p><p> “A perfect specimen of the highest</p><p>Byzantine period. A jewel! See—the </p><p>purest primary coloring—it was not until </p><p>centuries later that they discovered the </p><p>subtle shadings, you know.” He turned the </p><p>barbaric little object tenderly in his hand </p><p>to display the rich reds and blues. “Cloi- </p><p>son of purest copper and see the velvet </p><p>depth of that black enamel.” </p><p> “Priceless—priceless!” he was whispering</p><p>to himself, his prominent blue eyes held </p><p>hypnotically by the object in his hand. </p><p>“The most exquisite art—beauty passed </p><p>through thought and fixed in form!” He </p><p>suddenly jerked his head up and the blank </p><p>gleam in his eyes turned them quite mad. </p><p>“Two colors only I lack—two colors—the </p><p>unknown lemon yellow in a vitrified state </p><p>and opaque vermilion—they say there is </p><p>no ware of that—that it has never been </p><p>discovered, but I know better—there is.” </p><p>His face grew radiant </p><p>“One vase—peerless—I saw it once—■ </p><p>I held it in my hands.” His eyes seemed to </p><p>coruscate with their sudden lust for posses- </p><p>sion. “To think that I held it in my </p><p>hands! The priceless, secret vermilion; </p><p>deep bright lights in its depth like a pigeon- </p><p>blood cloisonne, but yellow—glorious as an </p><p>Autumn sunset. It had cost fortunes— </p><p>it had cost lives—it was the pinnacle of </p><p>beauty; I held it in my hands—and I let </p><p>it be taken away.” </p><p> Cleete’s voice, which had grown hys-</p><p>terically shrill, sank to a whisper on the last </p><p>words. The lids of his eyes drooped. It </p><p>was as though a film was drawn between</p><p>their mad blue fire and the spellbound </p><p>couple in the chairs. Abruptly he turned </p><p>on his heel and left them. </p><p> Even Trevillion’s debonair manner was</p><p>shaken by Cleete’s tirade. The girl was </p><p>unable to control a long slow shudder of </p><p>morbid fear. </p><p> “He’s crazy!”</p><p> Trevillion busied himself with a cigaret</p><p>for a moment before he replied. </p><p> “Perhaps. Every one is more or less of</p><p>a monomaniac on some subject. Why not </p><p>cloisonne ware as well as old masters? </p><p>Lives and fortunes have been lost for them. </p><p>Cleete is merely original. His passion will </p><p>undoubtedly some day cause his death,” </p><p>he finished, in a calmly judicial tone. </p><p> Again the girl was shaken by a shudder</p><p>and the smile she forced on Trevillion was </p><p>a ghastly failure. </p><p> “Please take me home—back to the city.</p><p>I—I’m always all in after a job like I pulled </p><p>tonight.” </p><p> She led the way gamely to the door,</p><p>forcing herself to walk easily; no one would </p><p>have guessed that the rugs and walls and </p><p>gleaming vases were all swimming before </p><p>her in a mad blaze of color. Her hands </p><p>were clinched until the nails drove little </p><p>half-moons into the palms; if Trevillion had </p><p>touched her she would have screamed hys- </p><p>terically. The dark face of the Portuguese </p><p>coming suddenly out of the shadows turned </p><p>her'weak with fright. </p><p> Then the night air, gratefully clean and</p><p>cool fell like a benediction on her upturned </p><p>feverish face. </p><p>VI </p><p>AT HALF-PAST five, Mrs. Sproule </p><p>raised her drowsy head from the </p><p>pillow to listen to a stealthy noise </p><p>in the hall outside her door. It was a </p><p>brushing, shuffling sound. </p><p> For a moment the good lady lay re-</p><p>sembling an “L” on its back then, with </p><p>sigh like the intake of a vacuum-sweeper, </p><p>she dropped her head back to the horizontal</p><p>position and proceeded to make the most </p><p>of the half-hour nap left. It was only the </p><p>cat, most likely. </p><p> But Mrs. Sproule was doing the cat an</p><p>injustice. The cat was curled up behind </p><p>the coat scuttle. It was Tom Fleming, </p><p>tastefully arrayed in overcoat and pajamas, </p><p>going down to the front porch to get the </p><p>morning paper. </p><p> Just what Tom expected to find in the</p><p>paper he had not dared to admit to himself. </p><p>His sleep had been a tortuous string of </p><p>emerald-studded dreams and the faint thud </p><p>which announced the advent of the morning </p><p>paper had sent him creeping barefooted </p><p>down the stairs after it. </p><p>Emeralds and Blondie </p><p> There it was—a column and a half on the</p><p>front page, under a two-column cut of Mrs. </p><p>Chetwynd in a pose which showed off the </p><p>lost necklace and her double chin to </p><p>advantage. </p><p> Tom curled his cold toes under him and</p><p>plunged in. At the end he was both </p><p>relieved and contemptuous. There was </p><p>no mention of the single unbidden guest </p><p>who had slipped through the door of the </p><p>ante-room nor of the faithless young man </p><p>who had let her go. Helen Mercer had </p><p>got safely away—thanks to his own gulli- </p><p>bility—so had the Chetwynd emeralds. </p><p> By all the law of logic, Tom’s mind</p><p>should have been the opposite of somber. </p><p>He had taken part in a drama which should </p><p>have spread the purple and gold of romance </p><p>over his mental skies. To be sure there </p><p>was the chagrin of letting a twenty-thou- </p><p>sand-dollar necklace slip through his fingers, </p><p>so to speak; but it was not this which </p><p>caused Tom to fling his clothes at himself </p><p>so savagely, nor yet his broken word to </p><p>Mullaney. </p><p> Nor again, was it the fact that to Helen</p><p>Mercer he must appear an easily impressed </p><p>fool. It was something deeper still; the </p><p>hurt realization that gray eyes could look </p><p>into his so candidly and still lie; the mem- </p><p>ory of an appealing face framed in pale </p><p>gold, a face childlike in its frightened inno- </p><p>cence, whose expression now he knew to be </p><p>the consummate point of art. </p><p> That thought was a wound which welled</p><p>the venom of distrust until Tom’s whole </p><p>world became tinged with the same horrid </p><p>hue. It was altogether unlikely that the </p><p>girl would ever set foot in the O’Farrell </p><p>Street house, or even that she had left any </p><p>clue by which he could trace her; but that </p><p>habit of thoroughness caused Tom to see </p><p>the thing through so far as lay within his </p><p>power. </p><p> But it was with little hope and still less</p><p>tact that he introduced the subjeet as he </p><p>stopped at the landlady’s door on his </p><p>way out. </p><p> “There’s a girl living here—or was,</p><p>rather—by the name of Helen Mercer,” </p><p>he began phlegmatically to the rather dis-</p><p>arranged lady who answered his knock. </p><p>“Do you know anything about her, Mrs. </p><p>Sproule?” </p><p> The landlady’s eyes wandered sharply</p><p>over his grave young face while her hand </p><p>strayed up and tucked in a kid curler which </p><p>had escaped from under the limp net frill </p><p>of the discouraged-appearing boudoir cap. </p><p> “No more than that I ain’t had no com-</p><p>plaints about her. She seems to be an </p><p>honest young woman an’ pays her rent in </p><p>advance.” </p><p> Her tone was acid and said that she saw</p><p>no reason to give information about one </p><p>lodger to another. </p><p> Tom continued, too dispirited to take</p><p>offense. </p><p> “Do you know any of her friends, any</p><p>way, so I could follow her up, I mean?” </p><p> “If you wait till six this evening, Mr.</p><p>Fleming, she’ll probably tell you herself.” </p><p>The landlady’s hands were placed bellig- </p><p>erently on her hips. It was only the abject </p><p>wretchedness on the young man’s face </p><p>which kept her from telling the fresh Mr. </p><p>Fleming what she thought of this uncalled- </p><p>for curiosity. </p><p> “She generally gets home about then.”</p><p>Tom positively winced. He knew that </p><p>Helen Mercer would never get home at </p><p>six again. When he spoke again, it was </p><p>so earnestly that the sharp remark forming </p><p>on Mrs. Sproule’s lips died a-borning. </p><p> “I’m awfully anxious to find out about</p><p>Helen Mercer, Mrs. Sproule. If you can </p><p>help me, I’ll be more than grateful. I—I </p><p>can’t tell you just what for—” the pleading </p><p>gray eyes of the night before seemed to </p><p>swim in the air before him and in spite of </p><p>himself he added—“it’s nothing to her </p><p>discredit, but I’ve simply got to find her.” </p><p>Something of his wretchedness must </p><p>have escaped in his tone for the landlady’s </p><p>words were sharper than her tone when she </p><p>replied: </p><p>“Well, I guess you’ll have to wait till </p><p>tonight, no matter how important it is. </p><p>She’s already gone to work this morning.”</p><p>Tom’s spine straightened as if an electric </p><p>current had suddenly been turned into it. </p><p> “You—did you say she was here—here</p><p>this morning? She came home here last </p><p>night?” </p><p> The landlady’s lips pinched reprovingly.</p><p>“She certainly did. I make it my busi- </p><p>ness to keep tab on my lodgers. Come in </p><p>late, she did; but when a girl’s young and </p><p>pretty she’ll be staying out late once in a </p><p>while and I ain’t narrow-minded; Miss </p><p>Mercer is a lady-” </p><p> Tom interrupted her. The change in</p><p>the young man was alarming. Mrs. Sproule </p><p>found herself viewing him with decided </p><p>Adventure </p><p>alarm. With her words, the unreasoning </p><p>hope that Helen Mercer could explain the </p><p>apparently explainable, tingled through </p><p>Tom’s very finger-tips. She had come </p><p>home! If she had taken the emeralds she </p><p>wouldn’t have done that. Maybe she </p><p>had been sincere in her agitation the night </p><p>before. Maybe Mullaney had overlooked </p><p>the emeralds and they would yet be found </p><p>without implicating Helen Mercer. The </p><p>honest gray eyes hadn’t lied—and she </p><p>didn’t think he was a soft-hearted fool! </p><p> The purple and gold rolled across the</p><p>horizon again—once more the world was </p><p>lit by pale gold hair and the radiance of </p><p>gray eyes. </p><p> Tom was a little wild-looking. The</p><p>impressionistic Mrs. Sproule took a back- </p><p>ward step. She had heard of a case once </p><p>where a young man just Tom’s age had </p><p>gone suddenly mad and chased his aged fath- </p><p>er up into an apple tree with a bread-knife. </p><p> “Mrs. Sproule—” odd how much music</p><p>could be injected into that name—“where </p><p>does Miss Mercer work?” </p><p> Tom fairly sang it and Mrs. Sproule eased</p><p>herself still further into the safety zone. </p><p> “Hoyt &amp; Brainard’s,” she snapped, and</p><p>the door was closed on the enemy. </p><p> That night, at eight minutes to six, the</p><p>crowds who passed a certain corner on </p><p>Grant Avenue were edified by the sight of a </p><p>young man stationed there, whose head </p><p>was apparently set on a pivot. Hoyt &amp; </p><p>Brainard’s block-square store had two </p><p>entrances, one main one, leading upon </p><p>Grant Avenue; the other, smaller, letting </p><p>upon an alley running along one side. It </p><p>was only when the six o’clock closing bell </p><p>rang and the main entrance had disgorged </p><p>its belated customers, that the gentleman </p><p>with the versatile head was able to cease his </p><p>double-barrelled watch and concentrate </p><p>his vision on the small door which was </p><p>beginning to trickle saleswomen, cash girls, </p><p>buyers and department heads. </p><p> He received several coldly questioning</p><p>looks when he started nervously after </p><p>strange young ladies—these were always </p><p>blondes, by the way—but he always re-</p><p>cuperated and came back to root again on </p><p>the spot which was beginning to be his </p><p>under squatter’s rights. </p><p> And then, among the last, she came.</p><p>A hurrying little figure in the familiar gray </p><p>coat, and her white face went whiter than </p><p>ever when she saw him waiting for her. </p><p> The young man plunged in, breathless</p><p>from the excitement gripping him. </p><p> “Miss Mercer, I just had to come down</p><p>and meet you. I didn’t know whether </p><p>you’d go home for dinner, you know, and </p><p>I couldn’t wait another minute.” He had </p><p>tucked his hand under her elbow to help </p><p>her off the curb quite as though it was not </p><p>the first time he had done it. “I’ve been </p><p>on pins and needles to see you—after last </p><p>night, you know. You promised to tell me </p><p>about it—I’m curious, although I always </p><p>knew you hadn’t taken the necklace.” </p><p> And he had known! Of course he had!</p><p>Maybe he had pretended to himself that </p><p>he had doubted her but down in his heart </p><p>he had known all the time that she hadn’t </p><p>taken it. Why, you could bank every time </p><p>on gray eyes that looked straight at you. </p><p>A girl like that couldn’t do anything crooked </p><p>if she were to try! </p><p> Throughout the mad torrent of his speech</p><p>the girl had let her glance drop to the side- </p><p>walk. A little pucker of indecision ap- </p><p>peared between the slim golden brows. </p><p>Twice she had started to interrupt and had </p><p>checked herself. Now she regarded him </p><p>with a long silent scrutiny from the corners </p><p>of the gray eyes. When she did speak it </p><p>was slowly as though she was having a hard </p><p>time to find the words. </p><p> “Mr. Fleming, I’m going to tell you</p><p>something because I have no one else to </p><p>turn to. In a way I owe it to you—I’ll </p><p>never be able to thank you for letting me </p><p>go last night.” She gasped a little at the </p><p>picture her fancy painted. “It would have </p><p>been terrible for me, because—you see— </p><p>I did have the emeralds.” </p><p> Tom never knew that he stopped still.</p><p>His legs ceased their motion automatically; </p><p>his brain too stunned to send out even </p><p>reflex orders. To the growing horror and </p><p>disillusion on his face she continued:</p><p> “Oh, please, wait a minute—I didn’t</p><p>take them—not intentionally, that is. I </p><p>didn’t know a thing about it until later. </p><p>I’ll tell you everything, then I want you </p><p>to tell me what to do.” </p><p> Tom automatically began to walk again</p><p>and as she kept pace the girl talked. </p><p>WHEN she finished, the young </p><p>man’s face was a study in conflicting </p><p>emotions. His voice was awe- </p><p>struck when he spoke. </p><p> “What a little brick you are, Miss Mercer,</p><p>Emeralds and Blondie </p><p>to keep your head like that! Why, I know </p><p>I couldn’t do as well—and I wanted to be a </p><p>detective,” he finished a little self-con- </p><p>temptuously. </p><p> “Oh, no!” The girl almost winced from</p><p>his praise and the faint pink flowed into </p><p>her pale cheeks. “Any one would have </p><p>done what I did. It was self-preservation, </p><p>Mr. Fleming. I had to—to play safe,” she </p><p>explained simply. “It was not until I was </p><p>right in the club, right before that terrible </p><p>Cleete that I realized it all. Before then </p><p>it was like some horrible practical joke, but </p><p>that man’s eyes—they changed so—” she </p><p>shivered again—“I just grew sick all day </p><p>thinking what might have happened if </p><p>they’d happened to find out they’d made </p><p>a mistake. </p><p> “I pretended to be this Blondie, of</p><p>course—I was afraid to ask any questions </p><p>for fear they would grow suspicious, but </p><p>I tried to remember all the man called </p><p>Trevillion had said about her and act up </p><p>to it. I don’t see now how I ever did it.” </p><p>The girl’s hands were working nervously. </p><p>As an automobile slid up behind her with </p><p>a low warning growl she jumped and </p><p>shrank closer to Tom. </p><p> “It seemed an eternity until I dared to</p><p>get away from that horrible house.” </p><p> “How did you get home?” Tom asked.</p><p>“Trevillion drove me back in the car,” </p><p>she answered without hesitation. “I didn’t </p><p>want him to know where I lived so I told </p><p>him the Kingsbury Hotel. It was very </p><p>late and dark when we got there, so I hid </p><p>in the entrance until he had driven away. </p><p>Then I ran home.” </p><p> Tom was unable to hide his admiration.</p><p> “You clever little thing!”</p><p> The girl shook her head vigorously to hide</p><p>her embarrassment. </p><p> “Mr. Fleming, what shall we do? That</p><p>necklace is around my conscience like a </p><p>millstone. When the papers came out with </p><p>that long story about it this morning I </p><p>wanted to run away and hide, I felt so </p><p>guilty. I could hardly bear to meet </p><p>people—to come to work—but I had to </p><p>return that gold dress before they dis-</p><p>covered it was gone. Oh, why did I ever </p><p>do such a silly thing as to wear it? Now </p><p>I don’t know what to do.” </p><p> “Got to turn the evidence over to the</p><p>police, I suppose.” </p><p> Tom’s tone was reluctant. He would</p><p>have preferred seeing this thing through in </p><p>story-book fashion. The detective hero </p><p>in the movies and the best-sellers invariably </p><p>works independent of the forces of law and </p><p>order who are introduced only to show up </p><p>the hero’s own superior methods. </p><p> The suggestion appeared to fill the girl</p><p>with alarm. </p><p> “No—oh, no! ” Her voice was sharp with</p><p>protest. “Not the police—the whole thing </p><p>would come out then.” In reply to his look </p><p>of involuntary surprise, her tone grew a </p><p>trifle calmer. “Don’t you see, if the store </p><p>discovered that I wore the gold dress </p><p>without permission I’d never be able to </p><p>get another position in this city. Oh, </p><p>please—Mr. Fleming—can’t you think of </p><p>any other way?” </p><p> It was too much in league with his own</p><p>secret ambitions. Tom capitulated with </p><p>shameful alacrity. </p><p> “Well, of course there must be a way</p><p>to get the emeralds back without yelling </p><p>to the whole world about it. Other fellows </p><p>have done things like that.” </p><p> He scowled intently for a moment and</p><p>the only sound was the ring of their heels </p><p>on the pavement. They were walking up </p><p>O’Farrell Street now, where the apartment </p><p>houses lined the blocks like enormous </p><p>soap-boxes; their lighted windows appear- </p><p>ing as holes revealing a center candle. The </p><p>fog was already topping the hill behind the </p><p>great red cathedral. The girl buttoned the </p><p>collar of her coat closer about her neck, her </p><p>grave eyes fixed on the young man’s face. </p><p> “Say—I’ve got it—I think,” Tom</p><p>drawled at length, his tongue lingering </p><p>over the words while his mind flashed back </p><p>over the plan which was solidifying in his </p><p>brain. “It’s kind of risky though. It’d </p><p>work if you had nerve enough to follow, </p><p>but—look here.”</p><p> In his enthusiasm he tucked the girl’s</p><p>arm close within his own, his head bent </p><p>close to her pale gold hair. </p><p> “We’ll hire a machine—or maybe we</p><p>can borrow one—well, never mind that </p><p>anyway.” </p><p> He took a fresh grip on the arm.</p><p> “Look here. We’ll go down there in a</p><p>machine, you and I, tonight maybe. We’ll </p><p>drive up to this place, taking care no one </p><p>sees me—can you drive a car? Fine,” at her </p><p>nod. “You’re supposed to be alone, see. </p><p>Well, you go in—we’ll have to cook up some </p><p>excuse for you going there but that’s a mere </p><p>detail—and while this Portuguese fellow’s </p><p>Adventure </p><p>taking you in I’ll climb up on that porch </p><p>affair you said ran along the back of the </p><p>house and get in a window—or some way. </p><p> “Meanwhile you’re keeping this Cleete</p><p>busy talking in the club rooms so I have a </p><p>chance to sneak into the little room and </p><p>steal the necklace back. Then all we have </p><p>to do is make our get-away.” </p><p> He waved his hand as if that was a mere</p><p>bagatelle. </p><p> To his disappointment the girl was not</p><p>overwhelmed in ecstasy at this attractive </p><p>plan. </p><p> “It sounds rather vague,” she said</p><p>slowly. </p><p> “Well, of course I haven’t worked it all</p><p>out yet—however if you want to chuck </p><p>the whole business, I guess Mrs. Chetwynd </p><p>can buy more-” </p><p> “Oh, no—no.” The girl shook her head</p><p>positively. “I was responsible for the </p><p>necklace going out of the ballroom in the </p><p>first place and I’m going to see that they </p><p>are recovered. And—and—I’m afraid to </p><p>tell the police,” she added in a whisper. </p><p> “Well—I’ll tell you what—I’ll take a</p><p>chance alone. I can find the place by </p><p>myself and I guess I’ll get in somehow-” </p><p> Again the girl interrupted him. Her</p><p>eyes were almost indignant when she looked </p><p>back at him. </p><p> “As if I’d let you do all that dangerous</p><p>work alone,” she exclaimed in loyal scorn. </p><p>“I guess it could be done, if I had the </p><p>courage,” she reflected slowly. </p><p> “Of course it could,” Tom pointed out</p><p>eagerly. All the romance in the world was </p><p>singing to him now. “It’s simple but </p><p>there’s its strength. I’m sure we could </p><p>get away with it.” </p><p> “But the necklace is in the safe. Cleete</p><p>locked it up. How would you get at it?” </p><p>“Oh, gee, that’s right.” </p><p> Tom was crestfallen. Again nothing</p><p>broke the muffled silence of the fog but </p><p>their own ringing footsteps. Then his </p><p>resourceful mind found the solution. </p><p> “If we had a cracksman—a regular safe-</p><p>opener, we could do it. You know— </p><p>Jimmy Valentine stuff of sand-papering the </p><p>finger-tips and working the combination. </p><p>I’ve got a friend who can, maybe, get me </p><p>one for a night.” Tom spoke as if cracks- </p><p>men could be rented like taxies. </p><p> The girl still looked doubtful, but Tom’s</p><p>imagination was working on all six cylinders </p><p>now and was unstopable. </p><p> “Say, I’ll bet any amount that we can</p><p>call the trick. I’ll bet that Mrs. Chetwynd </p><p>has her little old emeralds back by the day </p><p>after tomorrow and we pinch the whole— </p><p>and we arrest the lot. It’ll be a big feather </p><p>in my cap and it’ll pull Mullaney out of </p><p>the deuce of a hole—I ought to do this much </p><p>for Mullaney,” he said virtuously. “By </p><p>George, I will. Miss Mercer, you don’t </p><p>have to worry a bit. You’d better stay </p><p>home in case there’s any row and I’ll get </p><p>the emeralds back for you all hunky- </p><p>dory.” </p><p> He turned his head to find Helen Mercer’s</p><p>steady gaze upon him. There was an ex- </p><p>pression in those gray eyes which the young </p><p>fellow could not quite fathom. Her tone </p><p>betrayed amused toleration. </p><p> “Did you honestly think I’d stay at home</p><p>while you were running all that danger </p><p>to get the necklace back for me?” </p><p> Her lips curled into a peculiar little smile</p><p>before she turned back to the foggy street </p><p>again and her voice hardened with reso- </p><p>lution. </p><p> “I’m ready to start with you, Mr.</p><p>Fleming, whenever you say.” </p><p>VII </p><p>MR. WILLIAM HARTSHORN </p><p>was a specialist and his specialty </p><p>was cracking safes. Mr. Hartshorn </p><p>could crack the toughest safe that ever </p><p>contained a banknote, with the same neat- </p><p>ness and dispatch with which the average </p><p>citizen cracks an almond.</p><p> Time had been when no gentleman in the</p><p>profession had worried the authorities more </p><p>by his tireless and efficacious methods, but </p><p>of late the wheels of progress had been </p><p>turning without carrying Mr. Hartshorn </p><p>along with them. </p><p> Mr. Hartshorn’s—or, to give him his</p><p>common or garden name—“Honest Bill’s” </p><p>main trouble was obviousness. This is an </p><p>age of camouflage when the successful </p><p>crook, to get by, must resemble the rest of </p><p>the respectable background. Honest Bill, </p><p>on the other hand, could only play the game </p><p>according to regulation rules. Just as the </p><p>old-time barnstormer must have his tin </p><p>armor, his paper snow-storm and his East </p><p>Lynne music, so Honest Bill could only </p><p>crack a safe to the accompaniment of dark </p><p>lanterns, of gum shoes and jimmies. </p><p>And, as the beplumed Hamlets and </p><p>Emeralds and Blondie </p><p>171 </p><p>betighted Richards of the old days would </p><p>rave against the drawing-room hero of this, </p><p>who acts without shouting and dies without </p><p>stamping, so did Honest Bill rave in his </p><p>heart with the bitterest of professional </p><p>jealousy against those members of the new </p><p>regime who conducted their business with </p><p>no other aids save their own nimble wits. </p><p> Neither could Honest Bill understand</p><p>a fence such as Cleete. This again was a </p><p>sign of the new complications the profession </p><p>had taken on. But, though he was not </p><p>in favor of the system, though he did not </p><p>belong and knew better than to force his </p><p>way into that exclusive club, he took the </p><p>utmost care to give it no reason for offense. </p><p>The cloisonne vase collector and his asso- </p><p>ciates were feared among such as </p><p>Honest Bill as all of “Big Tim’s” North </p><p>Beach gun-men had never been. And they </p><p>were hated with all the zest of the unsuc- </p><p>cessful for those who succeed. </p><p> All of which is merely prelude to the fact</p><p>that, when correctly approached in regard </p><p>to the little matter of opening the safe </p><p>where the Chetwynd emeralds were serenely </p><p>twinkling to themselves, Honest Bill was </p><p>inclined to listen to reason. </p><p> Once only, had he hesitated, to look at</p><p>Tom out of little suspicious eyes. </p><p> “Say, there ain’t no joker in this thing?</p><p>It ain’t no frame-up?” </p><p> “Mullaney sent me,” explained the</p><p>young amateur detective, dismissing in </p><p>that simple phrase the two hours’ pleading, </p><p>worrying and eloquence which had been </p><p>brought to bear on the mystified Mullaney. </p><p>Tom’s explanation to the detective had </p><p>been beautifully vague; he had a hunch </p><p>which he thought would result in the return </p><p>of the emeralds if it was properly followed </p><p>up; said hunch requiring for a successful </p><p>termination only one cracksman who would </p><p>obey orders. </p><p> It is only fair to Mullaney to state that</p><p>under ordinary circumstances this modest </p><p>requisition would not have been supplied, </p><p>but Mullaney was in no position to with- </p><p>stand pressure. Emeralds loomed large</p><p>in his foreground; even hunches from </p><p>amateur detectives were not to be over- </p><p>looked—nor, on the other hand, to be too </p><p>greatly encouraged. Mullaney, were the </p><p>simple truth known, capitulated largely </p><p>to be rid of Tom’s flow of eloquence. </p><p> “Mullaney said that in view of that</p><p>Marchmont affair, you’d-” </p><p> “ ’S all right—’s all right,” put in Mr.</p><p>Hartshorn quickly. “Don’t you go gettin’ </p><p>excited an’ givin’ away no family hist’ries </p><p>now. Mullaney’s a square guy for a dick </p><p>an’ I’ll turn a little deal to satisfy him,” he </p><p>added magnanimously. </p><p> There was a brief pause, during which</p><p>Mr. Hartshorn’s eyes seemed to grow still </p><p>smaller and turn in until they finally </p><p>merged into one. </p><p> “Besides,” he continued bitterly, “it’ll</p><p>be nuts to me to even up on them swell guns. </p><p>Between them an’ burglar alarms it’s </p><p>gettin’ so there ain’t no profit in the game </p><p>no more.” </p><p> Why Tom didn’t lose his position in the</p><p>day which followed was one of those mys- </p><p>teries for which there is apparently no </p><p>earthly explanation. When he wasn’t </p><p>thinking of the Chetwynd emeralds lying </p><p>there in that isolated old house among the </p><p>whispering eucalyptus, he was busy pictur- </p><p>ing a face surrounded by pale gold hair— </p><p>hair with a curious frosty light in the waves, </p><p>and the clearest and steadiest of gray eyes. </p><p>The real-estate business was simply no- </p><p>where. </p><p> One ticklish bit of business Tom accom-</p><p>plished that day, in a way which caused </p><p>him to address an insultingly patronizing </p><p>glance at the pictured Napoleon over his </p><p>desk. He asked permission to take out </p><p>one of the firm’s touring cars, volunteering </p><p>the elastic information that he wanted to </p><p>show some people the country. The sales </p><p>manager, but half-listening, had grunted a </p><p>reply to this little request—a noise which </p><p>the young man chose to interpret as affable </p><p>acquiescence. </p><p>THE night was just the sort he </p><p>would have ordered for the business </p><p>in hand—a night apparently just </p><p>come up from the pit; a heavy fog rolling</p><p>in from the ocean, blotting out the stars, </p><p>its very density seeming to muffle the voice </p><p>and stop the ears with cotton. It hung </p><p>like a curtain over the highway, penetrating </p><p>with a wet chill which caused Helen Mercer </p><p>unconsciously to draw closer to the resolute </p><p>young man at the steering-wheel, while </p><p>Honest Bill in the tonneau slunk deeper </p><p>in the collar of his overcoat and cursed Tom, </p><p>Mullaney, the “swell guns” and the Chet- </p><p>wynd emeralds with true democratic im- </p><p>partiality. </p><p> Little was said on the way down. A few</p><p>172 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>short directions the girl gave when the roads </p><p>branched, removing one hand—she had </p><p>tucked them both into the opposite coat </p><p>sleeve, muff - fashion — to designate the </p><p>course. </p><p> Down the San Bruno Road, around the</p><p>curving hills where the great invisible bay </p><p>lapped below them, the machine hummed </p><p>along, its headlights boring into the wall </p><p>of fog forever rising twenty feet ahead. </p><p> The clock on the cowlboard showed</p><p>eleven when they reached the bumpy dirt </p><p>roud leading west from the highway. Ever </p><p>since they had left San Mateo behind the </p><p>girl had been at tension; now she was </p><p>sitting bolt upright on the edge of the seat, </p><p>her eyes staring fixedly into the fog ahead. </p><p>Her hair clung to her face in wet rings </p><p>as Tom could see from the corners of his </p><p>eyes. </p><p> His heart suddenly throbbed with the</p><p>joy of being alive—what romance! Riding </p><p>with a beautiful girl beside him; with an </p><p>ex-cracksman in the rear seat and a loaded </p><p>gun in his pocket; on his way to pick the </p><p>safe of an exclusive crooks’ club. D’Arla- </p><p>gnan and Monte Cristo owed him nothing </p><p>at all! </p><p> The girl’s hand slipped suddenly over</p><p>his on the wheel. She leaned closer until </p><p>her breath was warm on his cheek. </p><p> “You’d better get out now and let me</p><p>drive the car in alone. The house is right </p><p>up there behind some trees. Quick before </p><p>some one comes.” </p><p> They had thoroughly agreed upon their</p><p>course of action before they started, but </p><p>Tom now hesitated even while he slipped </p><p>from behind the wheel. The girl beside him </p><p>had suddenly ceased to be a novel heroine </p><p>in his mind; she was simply Helen Mercer </p><p>and the young fellow found that the thought </p><p>of letting her venture alone into that nest </p><p>of dangerous men filled him with panic. </p><p> “Helen—do you think you’d better?</p><p>Don’t you think after all it’s wisest for you </p><p>to stay with the car and let Bill and me </p><p>take our chances on getting in alone?”</p><p> For a long moment the girl in the driver’s</p><p>seat looked down into his eyes through the </p><p>dusk, the torture of uncertainty playing over </p><p>her face. Once she opened her lips with a </p><p>little impetuous gasp as though to tell him </p><p>something; then she shut it resolutely and </p><p>the gray eyes wavered and jerked away. </p><p> “You’re awfully good to run into this</p><p>danger—for me.” </p><p> She said it very softly. Her little gloved</p><p>hand suddenly seized one of his and pressed </p><p>it for a brief second to the cold curve of her </p><p>cheek; then the wheel was jerked around </p><p>and Tom found himself in the dripping </p><p>shelter of a tree watching the disappearing </p><p>red tail-light. </p><p> “Say boss,” Honest Bill’s voice sounded</p><p>in the ear Helen Mercer’s breath had </p><p>warmed and woke Tom with a start from </p><p>his rapturous reverie. “We’d better be </p><p>moseying. We want to get in while the </p><p>Portugee is takin’ the lady in.” </p><p> Tom morosely agreed. All the romance</p><p>of the thing was gone now. He hated him- </p><p>self for having countenanced this mad </p><p>scheme. He was afraid—horribly afraid, </p><p>for the girl. To thunder with the Chet- </p><p>wynd emeralds and to thunder with Hoyt &amp; </p><p>Brainard’s as well! If Helen Mercer was </p><p>harmed Tom knew that all the emeralds in </p><p>Jebel Sikait could never remove one atom </p><p>of self-reproach from his heart. What a </p><p>fool he had been—what an infatuated ass! </p><p> He was still calling himself names when</p><p>they came in sight of the house. It loomed </p><p>a gray ghost out of the fog; just as Helen </p><p>had so carefully described it before they </p><p>came here. Not a splinter of light shone </p><p>from the shutters. One window, whose </p><p>shutter had long since joined the dear </p><p>departed, glistened blankly at them in </p><p>hypocritical innocence. </p><p> It was hard to believe that all the De</p><p>Quincey dreams of splendor could be con- </p><p>cealed behind the weatherbeaten walls. </p><p>Hard to think that the cleverest crooks </p><p>on the Pacific coast were gathered together </p><p>within, and that into their midst a calm- </p><p>browed, frightened-hearted girl was ven- </p><p>turing alone. </p><p> Tom nearly groaned aloud, then sud-</p><p>denly stiffened. It was too late to change </p><p>matters now; the only thing which re- </p><p>mained was to see it through as well as </p><p>might be. He left the path and slipped </p><p>between the trees closely followed by the </p><p>cracksman. </p><p> Around to the back of the house they</p><p>felt their way; for they had decided to </p><p>enter by one of the upper windows. The </p><p>boarded-up window in the room adjoining </p><p>the safe was more direct, but infinitely </p><p>more risky. Here the fog was so dense that </p><p>they could just make out the headlights </p><p>of the machine stopped on the path before </p><p>them. Carefully they edged themselves </p><p>Emeralds and Blondie </p><p>173 </p><p>out of the radius of the lights into the </p><p>shelter of the eucalyptus tree whose </p><p>branches scraped the sagging upper veranda. </p><p> Even as they reached it they heard the</p><p>girl on the porch softly humming the same </p><p>strain which Trevillion had whistled that </p><p>other night. </p><p> “Up die tree.”</p><p> Tom breathed it close to Honest Bill’s</p><p>ear. The cracksman nodded with pitying </p><p>contempt. He had already grasped the </p><p>smooth trunk with his arms and was </p><p>perched in the branches above like some </p><p>outrageous bird before Tom had taken </p><p>more than two struggling heaves up the </p><p>trunk. Not a sound had escaped, though </p><p>to the young man’s excited imagination, </p><p>his own breathing sounded like the </p><p>whistling of the Overland Mail. Below </p><p>the girl still hummed her plaintive little air, </p><p>one hand pressed tightly to her pounding </p><p>heart. </p><p> When he reached the branch where the</p><p>cracksman perched, Tom was aware that </p><p>the door below had opened and Helen </p><p>Mercer had disappeared. The rotting ver- </p><p>anda stretched before them, piled high </p><p>with many years’ accumulation of fallen </p><p>leaves. Tom was grateful for the drenching </p><p>fog which had made them sodden. On a </p><p>clear dry night they would have rustled and </p><p>crackled like so much tissue-paper under </p><p>their feet. </p><p> A row of shuttered windows stared back</p><p>sullenly at them, mute testimony of the old </p><p>hospitable days when each had sheltered </p><p>a guest and the house had been the center </p><p>of social life for the surrounding ranchos. </p><p> very veranda slouched in a furtive way</p><p>like a spineless fellow who resents the </p><p>memories of more respectable times; but </p><p>however rotten the floor, the honest beams </p><p>held true. Beneath their cautious feet no </p><p>warning creak complained of their weight. </p><p>HONEST BILL’S figure had a brief </p><p>moment before merged into the </p><p>dark background of the house and </p><p>even as Tom tiptoed up he had noiselessly</p><p>forced the shutters on one window and was </p><p>busy with the old-fashioned lock on the </p><p>sash. Hartshorn’s little eyes were almost </p><p>crossed in his acute enjoyment. To jimmy </p><p>the very stronghold of his high-class com- </p><p>petitors; to outwit them by the clumsy </p><p>methods they despised—it was his idea </p><p>of the most exquisite humor. </p><p> The long unused window started to</p><p>protest audibly at this midnight disturbing </p><p>of its slumber but after being soothed by a </p><p>few drops from Honest Bill’s oil-can it slid </p><p>smoothly open and they slipped over the </p><p>sill into the room beyond. </p><p> The two men melted away from the</p><p>dangerous square of light and stood silently </p><p>for a moment, listening. Apparently the </p><p>whole upper floor was unused; at least </p><p>that part which faced the outside of the </p><p>house. It was as Helen had guessed, only </p><p>the heart of the building was used in order </p><p>to keep up, to the passer-by, the camouflage </p><p>of its one isolated tenant. </p><p> They felt their way noiselessly around the</p><p>dark room to where instinct told them a </p><p>door should let on the upper hall. The </p><p>room was semi-furnished in the style of </p><p>the ’6o’s. A walnut highboy, bare of any </p><p>trinkets caught Tom a nasty crack on the </p><p>knee and a dark mass in one comer, peril- </p><p>ously like an unusually tall man, sent his </p><p>hand jerking back to his hip-pocket until </p><p>his straining eyes told him that it was only </p><p>a roll of carpet propped against the wall. </p><p> Then came the soft scraping of a key</p><p>in a long-unturned lock and the young </p><p>fellow caught his breath nervously as he </p><p>stepped into the hall beside the cracksman. </p><p>The blood was tearing through his veins at </p><p>an alarming rate. He had the curious sense </p><p>of being a spectator instead of an actor in </p><p>this mad scheme he had staged, of watching </p><p>the body of Tom Fleming steal and swagger </p><p>his way through an impossible novel </p><p>instead of a situation of real life. He </p><p>wondered if Helen had this same oddly </p><p>detached feeling. The thought of her </p><p>steadied him and made him realize the </p><p>gravity of it all. For Helen’s sake as well </p><p>as their own they must find the emeralds </p><p>and get away quickly. </p><p> “Hurry—hurry.” He found himself</p><p>breathing it impatiently to the dark figure</p><p>beside him. </p><p> Honest Bill nodded offendedly. What</p><p>did he mean—“Hurry!” Did this guy </p><p>think he was stopping to drink a cup of tea? </p><p> The steep bare stairs quaked once as they</p><p>cautiously felt their way by the old-fash- </p><p>ioned banister and Tom’s heart quaked in </p><p>sympathy. Followed a hair-whitening </p><p>period when both flattened themselves to </p><p>the wall and their hands crept to the com- </p><p>forting bulge of the automatics in their </p><p>pockets. </p><p>174 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Two—three minutes passed. The dark-</p><p>nesss was unshattered by any warning </p><p>burst of light. In the room—evidently </p><p>the kitchen at the end of the hall—they </p><p>could hear the Portuguese moving about </p><p>on the bare floor. A subdued sound of </p><p>voices came from one of the center rooms— </p><p>evidently beyond those cracked and stained </p><p>white plaster walls was the Eastern luxury </p><p>Helen had described. </p><p> Again a start was made and they finally</p><p>stood, unmolested in the lower hall. The </p><p>voices were louder now. Once Tom was </p><p>sure he heard the girl’s clear treble, followed </p><p>by a smothered burst of appreciative </p><p>laughter. His heart swelled with both </p><p>pride and fear. The little brick—she was </p><p>playing up to her part. </p><p> Only for a moment they hesitated—that</p><p>lower hall was too dangerous. At any </p><p>moment the kitchen door might be opened, </p><p>exposing them to the view of the Portuguese </p><p>“watch.” </p><p> One, two, three—the girl had said the</p><p>third door from the front of the house led </p><p>to the room containing the safe. Tom </p><p>gently tried the knob and it turned in his </p><p>hand. The room was not even locked. </p><p> A sudden realization of the terrible power</p><p>Cleete must have over those clever crooks </p><p>to leave this valuable place unprotected, </p><p>smote Tom anew and caused him to break </p><p>out in a gentle but profuse perspiration. </p><p>He was dimly aware that Honest Bill had </p><p>drawn his gun and as he opened the door </p><p>an infinitesimal crack he followed suit, </p><p>almost prayerfully grateful for the com- </p><p>forting feel of the cold steel. </p><p> Luck played into their hands, this room</p><p>was dark, its only fight sifting in from the </p><p>narrow opening between the velvet cur- </p><p>tains which clothed a second entrance. </p><p>Prepared as he was by Helen’s recital, the </p><p>barbaric loveliness of the room nearly </p><p>carried away the young fellow’s breath. </p><p>It served to fill the cracksman with fresh </p><p>resentment. This luxury was like flaunting </p><p>the obsoleteness of his own methods in </p><p>Honest Bill’s face and in return he looked </p><p>around for the safe vindictively.</p><p> Tom stole on tiptoe to the opening in the</p><p>curtains and looked through. </p><p> He had always supposed the poet who</p><p>described Abou Ben Adhem’s room as being </p><p>“rich and like a lily in bloom” was press- </p><p>agenting at the time. Now the line in- </p><p>stinctively floated into his head. </p><p> Beneath the mica shades of the seven</p><p>suspended lamps, the room beyond ap- </p><p>peared to glow and throb with color like </p><p>the heart of a rich sapphire. Even Helen’s </p><p>half-awed description had not done it </p><p>justice. The intense blue of the hanging, </p><p>the rich background of the rugs fairly pulsed </p><p>with the exquisite shade, yet so softly, so </p><p>deeply that the eye was not offended but </p><p>drank it in appreciatively. </p><p> Above, in glorious contrast, glowed the</p><p>vases; the depthless carmine gleam of the </p><p>pigeon-blood cloissones, the strange rich </p><p>tones of the others with their contrasting </p><p>blacks and ivories and inimitable rare blues. </p><p> Merely to glimpse them was to under-</p><p>stand in some slight degree the strange man </p><p>whose passion they were. Crook he might </p><p>be—driven by the insatiable lust of posses- </p><p>sion—but artist he-’ certainly was. Then </p><p>Tom’s eyes fell on the group beyond and </p><p>his fascinated admiration was wiped from </p><p>his mind. </p><p>sp HELEN MERCER was enthroned </p><p>Duui hi one of the ebony chairs whose </p><p>somber black velvet outlined her </p><p>dainty slimness with the clean-cut lines of </p><p>a cameo. Her cheeks were high with color, </p><p>even the pale gold hair about her face </p><p>seemed vividly alive, her hands moved </p><p>animatedly as she illustrated her tale to </p><p>the little knot of men clustered about her. </p><p>It was evident to the watchful young man </p><p>behind the curtain that she was playing </p><p>her part under a terrible tension. </p><p> A tall young man in evening clothes</p><p>looked down, regarding her with such </p><p>obvious admiration in his narrowed black </p><p>eyes that Tom’s fingers instinctively curled </p><p>into fists. At that moment he hated Tre- </p><p>villion more cordially than all the rest of </p><p>them put together. </p><p> The gay little ripple of the girl’s con-</p><p>versation had caught even Cleete’s interest. </p><p>Tom recognized him at once from Helen’s </p><p>description. He was standing slightly apart, </p><p>undeniably commonplace in appearance, </p><p>appearing more like a divinity student than </p><p>ever, his mild blue eyes twinkling appre- </p><p>ciatively behind his thick glasses as the </p><p>girl reached the point in her story and the </p><p>little group of men broke into a soft roar. </p><p> Under cover of the next remark from</p><p>Trevillion, the girl shot a quick glance </p><p>toward the curtained doorway; a fright- </p><p>ened, anguished attempt to pierce the </p><p>Emeralds and Blondie </p><p>175 </p><p>narrow line of gloom in the center and dis- </p><p>cover if the two men had reached it yet. </p><p> The next minute she had flashed back a</p><p>whimsical retort and the animated smile </p><p>again played over her face. </p><p> If any impetus had been needed by Tom</p><p>to hurry, that momentary dropping of the </p><p>mask would have done it. His eyes were </p><p>jerked to the cracksman motionless beside </p><p>the safe except for his long twisting fingers </p><p>which turned the combination with in- </p><p>cessant patience, his ear flattened to the </p><p>lock to catch the faint click of the mechan- </p><p>ism as it fell in place. </p><p> A very agony of helpless impatience</p><p>seized the young man at the sight of that </p><p>crouching figure, apparently accomplishing </p><p>nothing while the precious minutes went by </p><p>and the girl played her dangerous game </p><p>unaided in the room beyond. He plunged </p><p>his twitching hands deep in the pockets of </p><p>his coat, grateful when they found and </p><p>closed about the handle of the automatic. </p><p> Now once again the romance of the thing</p><p>had faded, leaving a terrible fear in its </p><p>stead. He realized only too clearly the </p><p>noose into which they had run their heads. </p><p>They were as much alone in this isolated </p><p>house as if they stood in the middle of the </p><p>Mohave desert and the young man did not </p><p>deceive himself as to their probable fate </p><p>if this mad attempt should be discovered. </p><p> He checked an imploring whisper to the</p><p>cracksman to work faster; for a wavering </p><p>moment he even contemplated flight with- </p><p>out the emeralds—anything to get the girl </p><p>away from this house of fear. Then he </p><p>gulped and took himself severely in hand; </p><p>it would never do to have a fit of nerves </p><p>now. He must play it as gamely as Helen </p><p>was doing. </p><p> Again he turned back to the yellow slit</p><p>in the curtains. The movement set them </p><p>swaying ever so slightly and the single </p><p>sharp glance the girl sent, under cover of a </p><p>remark from the man called Clieve, showed </p><p>that the girl had interpreted it correctly. </p><p>Even at that distance Tom saw the color </p><p>seep slowly from her face, then as slowly</p><p>flood it again. He cast another glance </p><p>behind him at that shadowy figure before </p><p>the safe. The cracksman had seemingly </p><p>not moved, his head was still flattened </p><p>against the door, the fingers slowly turn- </p><p>ing — turning — apparently accomplishing </p><p>nothing. </p><p> God—couldn’t he hurry? Tom felt a</p><p>hysterical desire to shriek aloud for haste. </p><p>The next moment his forehead went cold </p><p>and wet. Cleete had left the little group </p><p>and was walking stright across the room </p><p>toward him. For one terrible moment </p><p>the young man stood spellbound, unable to </p><p>speak or give warning to the unconscious </p><p>cracksman behind him; hardly daring to </p><p>believe that those enlarged blue eyes behind </p><p>the thick lenses had not glimpsed him </p><p>through the slit in the curtains. He was </p><p>aware that Helen Mercer’s stricken face </p><p>had taken notice of Cleete’s departure and </p><p>his own anguished emotions seemed but a </p><p>continuation of her own. </p><p> It was not until Cleete was half-way</p><p>across the room that the spell was broken. </p><p>Tom took two steps back to the kneeling </p><p>figure. </p><p> “Quick—hide. Some one’s coming-”</p><p> Even as he said it came a crash and a cry,</p><p>loud and clear, to carry its message to him. </p><p> “Oh, Mr. Cleete—your vase—I dropped</p><p>it, that splendid new vase you were show- </p><p>ing me-”	i</p><p> Tom risked a second dash to the slit</p><p>between the curtains. Helen’s quick wit </p><p>had saved them. A priceless cloisonne lay </p><p>on the polished floor at her feet, its enamel </p><p>chipped and loosened. Cleete, everything </p><p>else wiped from his mind by this tragedy </p><p>of one of his precious vases had turned his </p><p>back upon the little room and was fairly </p><p>racing back to the ruin she had wrought. </p><p> “Fine—oh, fine!” some one inside of</p><p>Tom’s body seemed to be applauding the </p><p>girl’s act; some one who appreciated the </p><p>dramatic side of this breath-taking situation. </p><p> Then the cold-blooded critic was screamed</p><p>down by the rest of his mind. Tom found </p><p>himself towering over the crouching figure</p><p>of the cracksman. </p><p> “Hurry—hurry—for God’s sake—hurry,”</p><p>he was repeating it inanely, his finger-nails </p><p>biting into the palms for emphasis. </p><p> The noise without had increased beyond</p><p>its well-bred repression. Another voice— </p><p>that of the Portuguese—could be heard </p><p>raised apparently in protestation. </p><p> The cracksman suddenly straightened</p><p>with a little gasp of triumph; the safe </p><p>handle turned in his grip, the door swung </p><p>open. Into the dark interior a flashlight </p><p>gleamed for a breath’s space; greenly and </p><p>wickedly the twin emeralds seemed to leap </p><p>at the intruders before Tom’s fingers closed </p><p>about them. </p><p>176 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> The flash winked out, the men flung</p><p>themselves face about, their hands leaping </p><p>to their pockets. </p><p>*	The curtains before the entrance were</p><p>swaying, the yellow slit of light had dis- </p><p>appeared. Some one had slipped into the </p><p>room. </p><p>VIII </p><p>FOR a brief moment both men </p><p>held their tense positions, revolvers </p><p>drawn and pointed in the direction </p><p>of the frightened breathing. Then a whis- </p><p>per came across the room. </p><p> “Tom—are you there?”</p><p> “Helen!” Tom’s voice was husky.</p><p> A shadowy figure glided from its corner</p><p>and ran lightly across the room to them. </p><p> “Quick—something’s happened! We’ve</p><p>got to go! Antonio—the Portuguese—came </p><p>in and I’m afraid he’s found me out. I </p><p>didn’t wait—I slipped in here—quick, out </p><p>the window!” </p><p> As her words tumbled over each other</p><p>in her panic she was steadily steering him </p><p>to the further end of the room where a </p><p>velvet hanging pushed aside revealed a </p><p>bare, unfurnished room as poverty-stricken </p><p>as the others which bordered the outside of </p><p>the house. This was the room opening </p><p>on to the shallow, front veranda, the room </p><p>of the broken window pane. The girl was </p><p>shaking with fright and excitement; the </p><p>cold night air striking chilly on her arms </p><p>and neck left bare by the little satin evening </p><p>dress she wore. </p><p> “The window—quick, before they miss</p><p>me!” </p><p> The cracksman was already tugging at</p><p>the sash; hesitating to smash the glass and </p><p>bring the whole pack about their ears. </p><p>Above the rising excitement in the other </p><p>room a voice was raised shrilly in anger— </p><p>a girl’s voice. </p><p> “What the devil does this mean? Why</p><p>can’t I come in?” The voice grew louder, </p><p>evidently the owner had forced her way </p><p>into the room. “I tell this—this idiot—” </p><p>it was evidently the Portuguese who was </p><p>thus flatteringly designated—“who I am </p><p>and he says I’m already here!” </p><p> Here Cleete’s soft voice cut in—gentle</p><p>and chilly. </p><p> In reply the girl’s angry voice rose</p><p>louder. </p><p>“Who am I? I’m ‘Blondie’ Travers. </p><p>What’s this trash about me being down </p><p>here the other night? I never was here </p><p>before in my life; I’ve been two days </p><p>trying to find this place from the infernal </p><p>description Riddle gave me. Emeralds!” </p><p>She laughed scornfully. “Fat chance I got </p><p>at those emeralds! Oh, I was there all </p><p>right—I lifted them, too. </p><p> “It was like taking gumdrops from the</p><p>baby, but I couldn’t get away quick </p><p>enough. That fat woman discovered they </p><p>were gone and before I could get through </p><p>the beastly crush the entrances were </p><p>guarded. They were starting to search </p><p>people, too, and, believe me, I wasn’t </p><p>waiting for any aftermaths—I dropped </p><p>them and beat it so they wouldn’t be found </p><p>near me. </p><p> “Oh, I had my credentials for being there.</p><p>Riddle saw to that—but the confounded </p><p>emeralds weren’t found on the floor or any </p><p>place else. They were gone—melted— </p><p>vamoosed! It didn’t dawn on me until </p><p>tonight that they must have caught on </p><p>some one’s clothes and then I heard—oh, </p><p>never mind how, you people here haven’t </p><p>a corner on all the information in the </p><p>world—that I—that is, Blondie came </p><p>down to this place with the Chetwynd </p><p>emeralds. Somebody’s been stringing you. </p><p>Where is this other girl who’s been pre- </p><p>tending to be me?” </p><p> The rapid, high-pitched voice was inter-</p><p>rupted by a crash. Tom, throwing caution </p><p>to the winds with that last remark had </p><p>snatched off his coat and wrapping it about </p><p>his arm, Swept the sash clean of glass, </p><p>even as the sound of running footsteps </p><p>sounded in the room beyond. Almost </p><p>before his arm was drawn back, Honest</p><p>Bill leaped through the empty frame with </p><p>the agility of a cat. Tom lifted the girl, </p><p>half-dead with fright, after him, and then </p><p>swung himself over the sill on to the </p><p>veranda. </p><p> He groaned aloud when he remembered</p><p>that their machine was in the back, the </p><p>lights turned out and the engine probably </p><p>cold by now; a groan which changed to a </p><p>grunt of relief. An automobile stood before </p><p>the house, its headlights pointing back in </p><p>the direction of the road; a car, whose </p><p>excited driver had forgotten to turn the </p><p>engine off. </p><p> The door of the house burst open behind</p><p>them, even as he flung himself behind the </p><p>wheel. A flash lit the black space and a </p><p>bullet whined close by his head. Shouting </p><p>Emeralds and Blondie </p><p>177 </p><p>to the other two to crouch upon the floor </p><p>of the tonneau Tom lurched over the wheel </p><p>and slammed the machine into gear. She </p><p>started with a jerk and tore down the road, </p><p>the long rows of trees flying on each side </p><p>of him. </p><p> There was a maddening moment while</p><p>they were forced to slack speed to work </p><p>the mechanism of the gate, and in recog- </p><p>nition of their disadvantage came another </p><p>burst of flame and another bullet sang its </p><p>deathly song near them. Trevillion’s aim </p><p>was getting too good. Regardless of </p><p>the rough, unkept condition of the road, </p><p>Tom reeled the speedometer up to fifty, </p><p>keeping himsqlf from being bounced from </p><p>the seat by a savage grip on the wheel. </p><p> He could hear nothing for the whistling</p><p>of the wind as they cut through, but it was </p><p>just before they swung on to the smooth </p><p>asphalt highway that a scream came from </p><p>Helen— </p><p> “They’re coming in our car!”</p><p> A third shot whizzed by.</p><p> The young fellow shut his teeth hard</p><p>and pulled the wheel around, turning a </p><p>corner at thirty an hour, thanking his stars </p><p>for the nonskid tires. The fog had dis- </p><p>appeared now; the stars were glittering </p><p>coldly overhead. Watching his chance, </p><p>when he dared, the young man reached </p><p>down and switched off the tail-light, but </p><p>the others had already sighted them and </p><p>bore down at terrific speed. </p><p> A few late machines were passed, some</p><p>at a narrow margin; one driver yelling </p><p>angrily and swinging his car sharply into </p><p>the dirt as they grazed his fender. </p><p> Evidently they were being taken for a joy</p><p>party with more of a capacity for liquor </p><p>than caution. </p><p> Helen was kneeling on the floor of the</p><p>tonneau, her eyes glued to the lights of </p><p>the oncoming machine, while she yelled </p><p>their progress to Tom, having to put her </p><p>face close to his shoulder to make her voice </p><p>carry over the rushing of the wind. The</p><p>other car, with Trevillion at the wheel </p><p>and Cleete and the man Clieve in the back </p><p>seat, bore down on them along the dark </p><p>highway like some fire-spouting monster. </p><p> At San Bruno, another machine, bound</p><p>in the same direction, loomed before them </p><p>and Tom took a desperate chance. Reach- </p><p>ing over, without slacking speed, he </p><p>switched out his headlights, plunging the </p><p>highway into thick blackness; then he </p><p>12 </p><p>flung'the wheel violently over and swung </p><p>into the lonely branch road leading up </p><p>the peninsula. There was a chance that </p><p>their pursuers would follow the other car </p><p>up the highway, but this hope was shat- </p><p>tered when, on the desolate wide salt marsh </p><p>over which the road stretched, a fourth </p><p>shot was fired, this time striking the ground </p><p>close behind them. The marksman was </p><p>attempting to blow out their rear tires. </p><p> Tom groaned. He had taken the worst</p><p>possible course. At this time in the </p><p>morning the San Bruno Road was prac- </p><p>tically deserted; only the sprawling little </p><p>town of South City—dark at this hour- </p><p>breaking the dreary landscape of salt </p><p>marsh and barren hills. On the highway </p><p>the crooks would not have dared to fire </p><p>for fear of drawing undesired attention </p><p>upon themselves. On this lonely road, the </p><p>few people on the little dismal farms who </p><p>might hear the shots would not be inclined </p><p>to investigate. </p><p>A RAILROAD-CROSSING loomed </p><p>ahead, and even as they came upon </p><p>it the warning bell told of the train </p><p>further down the track, its headlights </p><p>already splitting the darkness. A quick </p><p>hope rose in Tom’s heart that the other </p><p>machine would be halted by that long </p><p>string of freight cars. He stepped hard </p><p>on the throttle and the car bounded over </p><p>the tracks, grazed by the descending gates. </p><p> A little cry was wrung from the girl,</p><p>then came a groan from the cracksman </p><p>and the other car suddenly appeared in </p><p>the fierce headlight of the puffing engine, </p><p>crashing through the gates as if they had </p><p>been so much tissue paper, bits of broken </p><p>glass and splinters of white wood dancing </p><p>in the dazzling light of the lamps.</p><p> Now Tom hit it up until the speedometer</p><p>reached the 60 mark. His arms ached </p><p>with keeping the machine to the center </p><p>of the road. His headlights were snapped </p><p>on—at that speed he needed every caution. </p><p>The car rocked and swayed with the bumps </p><p>in the asphalt; the wind, even with the </p><p>protection of the wind-shield, filling their </p><p>nostrils and mouths as if with water, </p><p>making them fight for each breath. </p><p> Another shot glanced off the ground</p><p>behind them, then another. The car had </p><p>started the climb of the hills now, the road </p><p>lined on one side by cliffs, towering into </p><p>barren peaks above; on the right aslope </p><p>i78 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>down to the dark waters of the back bay. </p><p> Around curves, Tom was forced to slack</p><p>speed to a certain extent for the hills jutted </p><p>in great raw walls about which he swept, </p><p>cut-out open, siren shrieking madly. Then </p><p>Helen made a discovery and yelled it to </p><p>Tom. From their superior altitude she </p><p>could see the pursuing car; catching </p><p>glimpses as it rounded the curves after </p><p>them—not more than this—a light was </p><p>following them, coming with a speed </p><p>which matched and surpassed either of the </p><p>machines. </p><p> “Police,” screamed Tom in explanation</p><p>and stepped on the throttle harder. </p><p> Around curves he was fairly safe, the</p><p>pursuers, uncomfortably close now, could </p><p>not take good aim; but a long level stretch </p><p>over the top of the grade appeared and in </p><p>answer a rain of shot struck the ground </p><p>behind them. The girl’s scream seemed </p><p>but an echo of the concussion of air and as </p><p>if in continuation came an explosion twice </p><p>as loud. </p><p> “They’ve got us!”</p><p> Tom felt a terrible tugging on his arms</p><p>and realized with a sudden stab of fear </p><p>that this time the marksman’s aim was </p><p>true. One of their rear tires had blown </p><p>out. The car careened madly to the right </p><p>and the young man threw all his strength </p><p>to straightening the wheel. From right </p><p>to left and back she swung; their rear </p><p>wheels defining a perfect half-arc. Then </p><p>he realized with a sick horror that the front </p><p>wheels were hanging over space—seemed </p><p>to hang there for a terrible eternity, then </p><p>the car slowly toppled over and Tom’s last </p><p>conscious thought was a feeling of mild </p><p>surprise that there was no echoing crash; </p><p>nothing but a swimming blackness and an </p><p>odd numbness in his arms—and oblivion. </p><p> Out of the blackness grew a star, an odd</p><p>green star which slowly turned golden and </p><p>whirled with frightful speed on one point. </p><p>A deep voice somewhere was repeating, </p><p>“making it rich and like a lily in bloom,” </p><p>which was so obviously ridiculous when </p><p>taken in connection with everything else</p><p>that his eyes fluttered open. For a mo- </p><p>ment his thoughts were entirely concerned </p><p>with the other stars—there were millions </p><p>of them, all crowding and elbowing each </p><p>other for room in his bedroom ceiling. </p><p> Then he became slowly aware that he was</p><p>wretchedly cold; that what should have </p><p>been his bed was oddly hard and stony </p><p>and that his bedroom ceiling was really </p><p>the sky. After that memory rushed back. </p><p>He was shaken, slightly nauseated, but </p><p>miraculously alive. Close beside him, some </p><p>one was crying softly and repeating his </p><p>name. He made an effort to lurch upright, </p><p>dimly conscious of a stabbing pain in his </p><p>side; and found himself looking unsteadily </p><p>into Helen Mercer’s eyes. The girl’s hair </p><p>was tumbled over her shoulders in a pale </p><p>gold mass; her eyes shone with tears in the </p><p>starlight. Tom’s eyes traveled jerkily </p><p>down her little satin evening dress, liter </p><p>ally torn to ribbons. </p><p> “You—you’re hurt?” He asked it</p><p>hoarsely. </p><p> She shook her head.</p><p> “It was the top—the top saved us, we</p><p>turned over on our side but the top saved us </p><p>from turning turtle. Oh, Tom—you aren’t </p><p>hurt—are you—are you-” </p><p> Her concern caused the young man to</p><p>put his unsteady arms about her and draw </p><p>her face feebly to his. It seemed the most </p><p>natural thing in the world to do, and quite </p><p>as simply the girl kissed him back. </p><p> It was a minute before he looked around.</p><p>They seemed to be in a ditch—the machine, </p><p>a wreck in the starlight, sprawled bulkily </p><p>beside them. The other car had com- </p><p>pletely disappeared. </p><p> “Honest Bill!” Tom exploded it.</p><p> Helen looked at him with fear and</p><p>remorse in her eyes. It was the first time </p><p>they had either one thought of the cracks- </p><p>man. He might be pinned under the car, </p><p>dying at this very moment. </p><p> “Tom, I never thought to look. I guess</p><p>I fainted for a minute and when I came to, </p><p>I was so worried about you. Oh, Tom—</p><p>you look—I don’t dare.” </p><p> Bitterly reproachful at his selfish over-</p><p>sight, Tom dragged himself unsteadily to </p><p>his feet and stumbled over to the toppled </p><p>car. He might have saved himself the </p><p>trouble. </p><p> Honest Bill was gone.</p><p> So were the emeralds.</p><p>“HEY! All right down there?” </p><p>The up-fiare of a flashlight slanted </p><p>for a moment on the face of a motor- </p><p>cycle policeman rather ludicrously poked </p><p>over the edge of the cliff, before it came to </p><p>focus on their upturned heads. </p><p> “All right for a funeral,” Tom croaked.</p><p> That stabbing pain in his side again,</p><p>Emeralds and Blondie </p><p>179 </p><p>hurting cruelly as he drew his breath. </p><p> The officer eased himself beside them;</p><p>made sure that they were in no immediate </p><p>danger of passing to the Happy Hunting </p><p>Grounds, then looked grimly over the </p><p>wrecked machine. </p><p> His wrath increased, as his anxiety for</p><p>them subsided. </p><p> “This is no place, nor no time to start</p><p>lecturing, but by way of a tip, the speed- </p><p>limit on this road is thirty an hour, not </p><p>sixty.” </p><p> The girl burst out hysterically.</p><p> “But you don’t understand—those others</p><p>were right behind us-” </p><p> “Racing ain’t no excuse.” The officer</p><p>said it more in weariness than in anger. </p><p>“Your joy-riding pals got away—I let ’em </p><p>go to come back and look for you when I </p><p>saw you go over the bank.” </p><p> “Got away—they got away!” Tom tot-</p><p>tered a couple of steps in disappointed </p><p>anger. “Those crooks got away-” </p><p> The sudden movement sent that shooting</p><p>pain through his side again and he caught </p><p>his breath with a stab. He saw Helen’s </p><p>anxious white face appear unaccountably </p><p>above his own and became aware that the </p><p>officer with sudden apprehension had leaped </p><p>to his assistance. Again the familiar little </p><p>green star began to bum in his brain. </p><p> “Oh,-.”</p><p> A voige, very weak and very far away,</p><p>yet undisputably his own, said it calmly </p><p>and deliberately. Then the whole world </p><p>went out in a blinding flash of pain. </p><p> At half-past nine the next morning,</p><p>Motorcycle Officer Bixbee walked into a </p><p>ward of the San Mateo County Hospital </p><p>with a curt but friendly nod to the golden- </p><p>haired girl whose anxious eyes barely left </p><p>the bandaged figure of the young man on </p><p>the bed. </p><p> In answer to Tom’s mute question, the</p><p>officer shook his head disappointed. </p><p> “No use—I guess we lost out. Oh, not</p><p>so far as the emeralds go,” he amended </p><p>quickly. “If, as you say, Honest Bill got </p><p>away with ’em we’ll get ’em back by night. </p><p>The San Francisco police are already on </p><p>his trail.” There was contempt in the </p><p>policeman’s tone. “But it’s the others— </p><p>the club. Too bad you and the young lady </p><p>wasn’t in shape to tell us about ’em last </p><p>night; we could have nabbed the whole </p><p>bunch. My thinking they were a joy- </p><p>riding party and you fainting just as you </p><p>was going to tell about ’em threw me off </p><p>the track. </p><p> “As soon as the young lady here recovered</p><p>enough to tell Blake about it a bunch of us </p><p>went down there. We found the house just </p><p>as she said—Lord, some joint, wasn’t it—■ </p><p>but they was all gone—even the Bohunk. </p><p>Left in quite some hurry from the looks </p><p>of things; rugs in a heap; safe door swing- </p><p>ing open and the safe itself as clean as a </p><p>whistle. Not a scrap of paper left to give </p><p>a clue neither. Found your car down there, </p><p>she’s some splashed with mud and the lamps </p><p>are battered up, but that was the only thing </p><p>they overlooked that wasn’t nailed down.” </p><p> For several minutes after the officer had</p><p>left, Tom lay with closed eyes, motionless </p><p>except for the rise and fall of the bed- </p><p>clothes over his chest. </p><p> The girl thought that he was sleeping and</p><p>tiptoed gently from the room. But Tom’s </p><p>brain was doing double-quick time and his </p><p>mental vision was not exactly reassuring. </p><p>It had taken the form of a huge ledger, with </p><p>these entries on the debit side: </p><p> Two Broken Ribs.</p><p> A Borrowed Machine, slightly banged up.</p><p> One Suit ot Clothes, simply nowhere.</p><p> And; vague, but grimly dominating the</p><p>future: </p><p> What were they going to say at the office?</p><p> The total was too staggering. Tom</p><p>opened his eyes in self-defense and fixed</p><p>them unblinkingly on the white plaster </p><p>ceiling. </p><p> Then, out of his Pandora’s Box of</p><p>Troubles came this little ray of comfort. </p><p>The kinetoscopic events of the past few days </p><p>whirled colorfully through his brain. Once </p><p>more his nerves thrilled to the gun-play as </p><p>they plunged from the fatal “club house,” </p><p>to the terrible moments of the mad dash up </p><p>the peninsula; once more he reached the </p><p>acme of excitement as the machine hung </p><p>for that eternity over the edge of the bank. </p><p> The unquenchable spark of the bom</p><p>adventurer gleamed in the young fellow’s </p><p>eyes and he broke into a grin. </p><p> “Anyway,” he gloated within himself,</p><p>“that was one time in my life when I was </p><p>living in high gear!” </p><p>A FEW Camp-Fires ago Harrison R. </p><p>Howard, of our writers’ brigade, sent </p><p>us a brief greeting as he took ship for France. </p><p>Here is a word from him, now a sergeant in </p><p>the - Engineers, written from the </p><p>other side, with a couple of clauses clipped </p><p>out by the censor: </p><p> It’s been a long trail since last I had opportunity</p><p>of writing you, a trail fraught with excitement and </p><p>bizarre pleasures. . . .

Howard. _</p><p>AT ONE of our Camp-Fires Edgar </p><p>Young “started something” by asking </p><p>“What is the spirit of adventure, particu- </p><p>larly as considered biologically? Also, an- </p><p>other of our comrades, Earl j. Teets, said </p><p>he’d been knocking around a good deal but </p><p>had never met adventure and is there any </p><p>such animal? One of the replies—to both </p><p>inquirers—is given below, from Charles </p><p>Beadle, who, like Edgar Young, belongs to </p><p>our writers’ brigade: </p><p>Grand Isle, La. </p><p> My dear Camp-Fire:—The question that Edgar</p><p>Young sets is most interesting. I should rather like </p><p>to have a shot at it. Yet it is such a mighty big </p><p>question to propound the definition of the spirit of </p><p>adventure that I am going to hedge by, as politely </p><p>as possible, inquiring what may be the spirits of </p><p>love (sex attraction) and hunger? For does she</p><p>not hunt with the same pack? </p><p>BIOLOGICALLY, I should say, that adventure </p><p>(not the magazine, with due respect!) is as impor- </p><p>tant as her (I say her advisedly, because she is so </p><p>entrancing to a male) two sisters in the evolution of </p><p>man. The purpose of definition is best served per- </p><p>haps, on the principle of a pound of fact is worth, etc., </p><p>by a simile. It is easy to imagine that some primeval </p><p>person of the crustacea family thoroughly enjoyed </p><p>his meals whatever they were, also his mate who- </p><p>ever she was. Is it inconceivable that the sand </p><p>crab owed its existence to that very spirit of ad- </p><p>venture worrying innumerable ancestors into finding </p><p>out what was going on in that interesting land, the </p><p>beach, and in another element, air? </p><p>“There’s something lost behind the sand-dunes! </p><p> Go and find it!”</p><p>sang the crustacean Kipling. Get me? </p><p> As for the second regarding intellectual adventure,</p><p>is not this question answered by Edgar Young? </p><p>The impulse which prompted him to ask the ques- </p><p>tion is the lady herself! </p><p>AS FOR Earl J. Teets I would say, in all comrade- </p><p>ship, that I suspect that he has sailed in con- </p><p>sort with JJ. S. S. Adventure many a time and oft, </p><p>but that he has mislaid his signal-book. Has he </p><p>never for example, felt a thrill during “line of bat- </p><p>tle”—even at maneuvres? If so, let him know that </p><p>that was a promise of the kisses to come. And for </p><p>a recipe let him take, when he be free, this recipe, </p><p>which, like the patent medicine “unsolicited testi- </p><p>monials,” I may recommend from personal experi- </p><p>ence: Take one map of the- world; and with eyes </p><p>blindfolded stab seven times, note countries pier.ced; </p><p>take a coin and toss and reduce same to one: GO to </p><p>that One. Never mind how, but go. If he doesn’t </p><p>find adventure, the Lord help him, I can not!— </p><p>Charles Beadle. </p><p>■\X7HEN he wrote the story and the brief </p><p>▼ ’ letter in January, our comrade, W. </p><p>Townend, was stationed at Queenstown, </p><p>Ireland, a lieutenant in the Royal Welsh </p><p>Fusiliers. In May, when I write this, he </p><p>may be one of those meeting the big Hun </p><p>offensive. In August, when you read this, </p><p>I hope that the German offensive power </p><p>may be broken and that at least the be- </p><p>ginning of their end may have dawned. It </p><p>may take'years, but at least we can hope </p><p>that months or weeks will do it. However </p><p>long it takes, I hope no soft, temporizing</p><p>peace will be made until the Hun’s fangs </p><p>180 </p><p>The Camp-Fire </p><p>181 </p><p>have been pulled and he ceases to be a </p><p>menace to democracy, freedom and real </p><p>peace. And I’m wondering what the com- </p><p>ing struggle has in store for Townend, who </p><p>gives us this story. Good luck to him </p><p>and God bless him, and all the others who </p><p>are fighting the good fight. Here is his </p><p>word about the story: </p><p>Spike Island, Queenstown, Ireland. </p><p> January 12, 1918.</p><p> The main facts are accurately stated—that is, the</p><p>dugout, the blocking of the doorway, shell-shock </p><p>and the trench rats. I can assure you I hated the </p><p>rats in France as much as I ever hated anything. </p><p>—W. Townend. </p><p>ALL American citizens are drawn from </p><p>two sources—children and immigrants. </p><p>If you want clear water in a barrel there </p><p>isn’t much use in trying anything else until </p><p>you’ve stopped or clarified any streams of </p><p>dirty water that may be flowing into the </p><p>barrel. To put the matter baldly, both the </p><p>streams that fill the barrel of American </p><p>citizenship are pretty muddy. There is no </p><p>sense in blaming the streams for being dirty. </p><p>It is our job to keep them clean. </p><p> What do we do to keep these two streams</p><p>dean, to ensure good American citizens in- </p><p>stead of bad? What have you ever done </p><p>toward it? </p><p>npHE American League for Citizenship </p><p>has been incorporated to afford the </p><p>means of united effort toward this end, to </p><p>install the teaching of real citizenship in all </p><p>our schools and to limit immigration to </p><p>what we can really absorb and to what will </p><p>not merely pollute the water in our barrel. </p><p>TIT ERE is a letter from Stephen Chalmers, </p><p>J- A comrade of our writers’ brigade. The </p><p>following I pumped out of him in the course </p><p>of a long conversation on immigration and </p><p>citizenship in general. He was a British </p><p>subject, a Scotchman. Even though he had </p><p>lived in this country quite a number of </p><p>years, he would not ask for American citi- </p><p>zenship until he felt he had been here long </p><p>enough to be really assimilated, sufficiently </p><p>understanding of American ideals to be a</p><p>really worthy citizen of the country to which </p><p>he intended to transfer his allegiance. Do </p><p>you get the full force of it? This immigrant </p><p>would not accept American citizenship until </p><p>he felt he was worthy of it! Our laws giving </p><p>citizenship to many who are not worthy of </p><p>it, this immigrant takes the responsibility </p><p>and the ideals into his own hands and makes </p><p>sure that in at least one case the United </p><p>States of America does not get a citizen who </p><p>is unworthy. </p><p>*	I 'HAT is very splendid. But doesn’t it</p><p> make you, one of those who determine</p><p>our laws and policies, rather ashamed that </p><p>the vote of this clean American citizen, or </p><p>of a native-born American, is nullified by </p><p>the vote of some unworthy immigrant who </p><p>should never have been given citizenship? </p><p>Say, for example, some German who has </p><p>since been using his American citizenship as </p><p>a means of hurting America and helping her </p><p>enemy, Germany, the perjury of his broken </p><p>oath of allegiance to us not even being pun- </p><p>ished, his American citizenship not even </p><p>taken from him. </p><p> Who determines whether such things</p><p>shall be? The politicians? No! You and </p><p>I and the rest of the hundred million Ameri- </p><p>cans who hold the fundamental power al- </p><p>ways. The politicians can do only what we </p><p>let them do. You can argue a thousand </p><p>years but you can never shake that fact. </p><p>You can fail to use your share of the funda- </p><p>mental control, you can dodge your duty </p><p>and be a dead weight and parasite, but you </p><p>can never free yourself of the responsibility. </p><p> If our immigration laws are faulty, if</p><p>some of our immigrants pollute the water in </p><p>our barrel, yon are one of those who are to </p><p>blame. </p><p>*	I 'HERE are many remedies that might</p><p> be applied. Mr. Chalmers’ letter sets</p><p>forth one of them that merits your serious </p><p>consideration—if you are a real American, </p><p>a real believer in democracy, not a parasite, </p><p>a shirker, or something worse. </p><p>Saranac Lake, N. Y., March 1,1918. </p><p> . . .You know my feeling in this matter. I ob-</p><p>ject to the walk-up of illiterate citizens who get first</p><p>papers without a deep realization of what they are </p><p>doing. During the next five years their environ- </p><p>ment is not always conducive to proper thinking and </p><p>when they get second papers they are too often </p><p>under the influence of this environment and are </p><p>worse than no citizens at all. </p><p> I would like to see the law changed to at least two</p><p>years before any concession is granted, and then </p><p>only under the strictest examination as to integrity, </p><p>intelligence, understanding of citizenship, record in </p><p>the interval (to be supplied by pastor, rabbi, dis- </p><p>trict police—what you please). In short, even as </p><p>somebody or other served seven years for Ruth—, </p><p>and then some—make prospective would-be citizens, </p><p>regard citizenship as a prize to be won and worth </p><p>winningl	-</p><p>182	Adventure</p><p> Every vote of a bad citizen is destructive of the</p><p>vote of a good citizen, and surely the American bom </p><p>is entitled to have his franchise protected against </p><p>the influenced vote of the illiterate.—Stephen </p><p>Chalmers. </p><p>IN CONNECTION with his story in </p><p>this issue Hugh Pendexter gives us a </p><p>little historical “dope”: </p><p>Norway, Maine. </p><p> I have taken St. Clair’s (spelled Sainclair in the</p><p>old ballads) defeat and Wayne’s victory over the </p><p>Northwestern Confederacy for the background of </p><p>this yarn. The invitation to war was given by red </p><p>belts, strings and red sticks, the latter commonly </p><p>being used by the Creeks and their cousins the </p><p>Scminoles, and radiating from them up the Mis- </p><p>sissippi valley. </p><p> A Hidatsa Indian, living in Dakota in 1865, was</p><p>held by the Indians to be a mighty magician be- </p><p>cause of his trick of producing red, ripe cherries from </p><p>his mouth at any season. It is supposed he pre- </p><p>served them in whisky. He was known as “Cherry- </p><p>in-the-Mouth.” As it’s never to my knowledge </p><p>been played up in fiction I have transposed the trick </p><p>back to 1791 for a white man to play. </p><p> Little Turtle’s speech, “I am the last, etc.” is a</p><p>matter of history. </p><p>J HAVE shown that Bund was ransomed with- </p><p>out narrating in detail the fact. The Indian </p><p>and historical dope is O.K. Papakeecha, alias Flat </p><p>Belly, lived and had his being. I have tried within </p><p>the limited scope of the short story to sketch the </p><p>horror caused by St. Clair’s defeat, and the ter- </p><p>rible possibilities for lonely cabin or settlement any- </p><p>where north of the Ohio. The Indians’ turning </p><p>back with their white prisoner instead of pressing </p><p>on to the Ohio is true to life, as their service was </p><p>purely voluntary and they could quit at any time </p><p>without losing caste or inviting punishment.— </p><p>Hugh Pendexter. _ </p><p>ONE of the few unwritten laws of our </p><p>Camp-Fire is that, when it comes to </p><p>printing, we devitalize cuss-words by using </p><p>dashes to indicate them, and the same rule </p><p>holds in our fiction stories. But perhaps </p><p>some of you noticed that in a recent serial, </p><p>“For the Flag,” we let one cuss-word go as </p><p>it lay. The following letter to me from the </p><p>author explains the exception: </p><p>Richmond, Va. </p><p> I want to ask, while I think of it, one special favor</p><p>regarding the story. </p><p> In chapter 26 Billy Smith, in speaking to the</p><p>German minister of the Kaiser, says: “To hell </p><p>with him and all his brood!” </p><p> Now Billy means this with all his heart when he</p><p>says it. He doesn’t mean “To-with him;” he </p><p>means “To HELL with” the murdering scoundrel. </p><p>I myself meant it when I wrote it, and I’m sure'that </p><p>it echoes your personal sentiments. So I beg of you </p><p>—please—to let the word stand when the story goes </p><p>to print, and thereby bring mild comfort to the souls </p><p>of the men who read it, and who in concert with you </p><p>and me could voice what they feel in far stronger </p><p>terms if it were permissible to put them in type. </p><p> I understand why, as a rule, you don’t let down</p><p>the bars to maledictory expressions in Adventure, </p><p>but here’s a case when the exception cries aloud for </p><p>admission, and with a world-wide reason to stand </p><p>upon.—Thomas Addison. </p><p> I don’t believe you’ll blame me for mak-</p><p>ing an exception of this case, though even </p><p>where the full strength of the cussing is so </p><p>strongly called for we can’t keep up this </p><p>exception business. For example, person- </p><p>ally I have no brief for the Kaiser, unless it </p><p>is that maybe he’s insane or the helpless </p><p>tool of still worse men. I can, in his case, get </p><p>along with nothing more than dashes. But </p><p>when it comes to Ludendorff, the Crown </p><p>Prince, Hindenburg and Tirpitz it strains </p><p>me a bit to be limited by clashes. If Mr. </p><p>Addison can fill ’em in for the Kaiser, why </p><p>shouldn’t I be granted exceptions in these </p><p>other cases? So there it goes. Mr. Addi- </p><p>son’s exception mustn’t be considered a </p><p>precedent or all the rest of us will be claim- </p><p>ing equal privilege. </p><p>TF YOUR magazine is late in reaching </p><p>you, please allow for present unsettled </p><p>transportation conditions before hopping </p><p>on to us. Because of war conditions we’re </p><p>starting the magazine out a week or ten days </p><p>earlier then formerly, but troops, ammunition </p><p>and supplies rightfully take precedence over </p><p>magazines and the general routine of ship- </p><p>ping is necessarily disturbed in many ways. </p><p>ON THE opposite page are some old </p><p>friends of ours. W. C. Tuttle, who </p><p>introduced us to Ike, Magpie and the rest </p><p>of their bunch, used to be a cartoonist on </p><p>a Spokane daily. Last Christmas, through </p><p>his kind offices, I received a snap-shot of </p><p>Magpie et al by way of greeting. Along </p><p>with my thanks I ventured a regret that </p><p>Half-Mile Smith and Dirty-Shirt Jones had </p><p>so conspicuously slighted me and later was </p><p>delighted to receive, via Mr. Tuttle’s pen, </p><p>a photo from Piperock’s leading pho- </p><p>tographer. It appears on page 184 and </p><p>bore on its back this legend: </p><p>DIRTY-SHIRT JONES (standing) and HALF- </p><p>MILE SMITH. </p><p> Being as they were not in Xmas group, they</p><p>willingly posed for this photo. They both send </p><p>regards. The negative was retouched a little too </p><p>much but otherwise it is good. </p><p> I	thought you might like to see just what</p><p>these old friends look like. </p><p>The Camp-Fire	183</p><p>Adventure </p><p> TjXDLLOWING our Camp-Fire custom,</p><p> ^ Gladys E. Johnson, on the occasion of</p><p> her first story in our magazine, rises and in-</p><p> troduces herself to us, getting, I know, the</p><p> friendly welcome we always have for the</p><p> few women who gain membership in our</p><p> writers’ brigade:</p><p> It’s a handicap, being a woman. That highly</p><p> original remark is called into being by my nosing</p><p> this little biography of mine in among the Indian</p><p> fighters, the explorers and the “knights of empire”</p><p> generally, whose histories go to make up the Camp-</p><p> Fire.</p><p> 'T'HRILLING adventures have a way of side-</p><p> stepping the female of the species, as a usual</p><p> thing. It’s most discouraging; all my life I have</p><p> been trying to put myself in the way of thrillers</p><p> only to have them jump clear over my head or burst</p><p> into nothing at the most intense moment. But in</p><p> spite of my efforts, the only thrilling adventure</p><p> which has happened to me in the last two years was</p><p> turning an automobile, containing five people, on its</p><p> side, while driving at forty-seven miles an hour.</p><p> Even here my diabolical good luck stayed with me,</p><p> for, miraculous as it sounds, no one was even mussed</p><p> up. But at that, my passengers on that occasion</p><p> unanimously agreed that it was adventure enough</p><p> for them.</p><p> Since then, though most of my spasmodic vaca-</p><p>tions have been spent in the mountains trying to </p><p>trap adventures—and the mountains of California </p><p>can be pretty wild—so far, the cougars and griz- </p><p>zlies have been gentlemen enough to overlook me. </p><p>T HAD the same good misfortune as a child. </p><p> You’d think that a childhood spent largely in</p><p>logging-camps could boast some dramatic moments, </p><p>but all I brought away was an unsatisfied longing </p><p>for excitement and a never-forgotten picture of that </p><p>beautiful, wild California background. </p><p> I have found the dwelling-place of adventure</p><p>many times, shortly after it moved out. Last Sum- </p><p>mer I trailed it, by the aid of gasoline, through this </p><p>State down into Mexico. At a bull-fight in that </p><p>country I almost caught up with it, but after the one </p><p>dramatic moment, occasioned by the “toro” nearly </p><p>hooking a matador, the bull-fight simmered down </p><p>to a rather tame affair—and I’m not bloodthirsty </p><p>either, as evidenced by my nearly turning the car </p><p>over a second time to avoid a ground squirrel on the </p><p>road through the Mojave Desert. </p><p>'T'HERE was only one time when I was living on </p><p>all six cylinders and having the thrills of my </p><p>own heroes. This was three years ago when I was </p><p>working on a San Francisco newspaper. Having </p><p>too little patience and too much sense of the ridicu- </p><p>lous, 1 graduated from “sob-sister” on the paper to </p><p>a sort of female troublc-hunter. The paper em- </p><p>barked on several reform campaigns; the most ex- </p><p>citing being an ex|x&gt;s6 of the fake fortune-tellers and </p><p>clairvoyants in this city. As I was playing detec- </p><p>tive for the paper in an effort to obtain proof of their </p><p>“bunco” methods, I, for once, had my fill of thrills, </p><p>especially when I was trailed and eventually con- </p><p>fronted with my real identity in a clairvoyant’s </p><p>office. For a moment I expected to have to do the </p><p>movie stunt of kicking the window out and jumping </p><p>on to an electric sign a story below, for I was pretty </p><p>unpopular in that office right then. Afterward, I </p><p>laughed to remember that in the excitement of the </p><p>moment I thought with true stage newspaper loy- </p><p>alty, “Anyway, it’ll look fine in the evening edi- </p><p>tions.” Then once more Fate backed down and I </p><p>was allowed to walk out of the door like any other </p><p>mortal. </p><p>T'HE newspaper work was the best sort of train- </p><p>ing for the fiction writing, which I immediately </p><p>afterward took up. I haunted the police-courts </p><p>and the waterfront and came in contact with some </p><p>curious and rather gruesome characters. Many an </p><p>idea for a story was bom while I listened to the </p><p>strange result of tracing down a news story to make a </p><p>“feature” out of it or stumbled over some novel and </p><p>haunting situation which had no news value. </p><p> A year of reporting and I took the jump—left the</p><p>paper and launched into the fiction game and now I </p><p>am putting my “heroes” through some of the strange </p><p>experiences 1 have heard, and introducing into my </p><p>stories some of the queer people I have met. </p><p>A FTER all, it’s pretty much of an adventure just </p><p>living in San Francisco. It’s the “story-book </p><p>city,” with its Chinatown, its queer, sordid Greek </p><p>quarter, its waterfront, whose habitufis are re- </p><p>cruited from the Seven Seas, its Barbary Coast and </p><p>its Kearney Street—the Rialto of the Adventurers, </p><p>Will Irwin calls it. </p><p>The Camp-F ire </p><p>i«5 </p><p> And, Gelett Burgess says that anything can hap-</p><p>pen in San Francisco, so, who knows, maybe I will </p><p>still bump into my hair-raising adventure!— </p><p> Gladys E.

Huston talks about In- </p><p>» V dians he knows what he’s talking </p><p>about. Here’s a letter to us from him </p><p>which “Uncle Frank” labels as follows: “On </p><p>Roping the Legs and Other Maunders.” </p><p> _ All squaws amongst the plains Indians, who con-</p><p>sidered virtue as an essential jewel, “roped” them- </p><p>sdves. The manner varied according to individual</p><p>taste and the necessities of the moment. At times a </p><p>thong at ankles or knees allowing them to shuffle </p><p>along and at others an elaborate arrangement from </p><p>ankles to waist with variations. An analogy may </p><p>be seen with the Oriental custom of spiked belts anil </p><p>padlock with this difference; the squaws roped for </p><p>self-protection, as the penalty for violation of a </p><p>roped squaw was death. No woman old or young </p><p>would leave the teepee without roping. Should they </p><p>do so it would be advertising that they were com- </p><p>mon property, and a husband, brother, father or </p><p>son would stand by and see them used like soiled </p><p>doves without redress. </p><p>JT SHOULD be understood that the teepee and </p><p>all pertaining to it, even the travois and ponies </p><p>of burden were the property of the squaws; all the </p><p>buck owned was his war-ponies, clothes and weapons </p><p>of war and chase. In the home the woman was su- </p><p>perior and could throw out the buck, even a big </p><p>chief, and chuck his possessions at his head, as was </p><p>occasionally done, not, however, if the buck was a </p><p>good provider. As a protection against abuse the </p><p>squaw could and did, even before her buck’s eyes, </p><p>propose that some other buck make up her dowry </p><p>and take her as his squaw. </p><p>YA7 HAT the whites called buying a wife was really </p><p>a form of the European dowry. In some tribes </p><p>a suitor would tie his pony near his adored’s teepee; </p><p>if she fed and watered it it was equivalent to saying </p><p>yes. In others he left game at the entrance of the </p><p>teepee; if she took it in and cooked it he was accepted. </p><p>In others he made a rude reed whistle and at dusk </p><p>would tootle for his charmer. If she, like Barkis, </p><p>was willing, she would steal out, roped however, </p><p>squat alongside him and with a blanket wrapped </p><p>around them pulled over their heads they would sit </p><p>for hours in seeming silence.	'</p><p> Sometimes a dozen flutes would be going atvjnce,</p><p>but no maiden ever seemed to mistake the wrOrog </p><p>buck. I once heard the squaw of a poor hunter len'j- </p><p>ing a buck in front of her husband that she liked him </p><p>better than she did her own man and for him to give </p><p>her man the amount of her dowry and she would </p><p>move to his teepee, while all the while her buck sat </p><p>with passive face taking it as a matter of course, </p><p>which it really was. </p><p>'T'HE whites introduced buying of wives, but for a </p><p>long time the Indians thought 1hey were only </p><p>complying with Indian customs and were sore when </p><p>the whites would go away and leave their squaws </p><p>and progeny for the tribe to support. </p><p> Love in its highest sense appeared to be un-</p><p>known; the relations were purely sexual and the </p><p>whoie thing to the acute observer appeared like a </p><p>partnership. His duties were to protect, obtain </p><p>game and skins, and to war; hers to prepare food, </p><p>cloth, house and bedding from the skins he ob- </p><p>tained and to do what slight tillage was done, to fur- </p><p>nish wood and water—everything, in fact, that </p><p>would leave the buck liberty to perform his duties, </p><p>and each was proud and jealous of his or her prerog- </p><p>atives, these being sharply defined. Both squaws </p><p>and bucks despised the whites because the latter did </p><p>work pertaining to squaws and therefore seemed to </p><p>lose caste, as one might say. </p><p>'J'HE dog-soldiers were a sort of police, at times </p><p>under direction of the elders, but having a dose </p><p>rdation to the medicine-men who also directed them </p><p>at times. They appeared to be a sort of militant </p><p>neophyte, if one may use that term, and were exe- </p><p>cutioners, preservers of law and order, and had vari- </p><p>ous other duties. </p><p> The Dakotoh being of the Algonquin stock (origi-</p><p>nal habitat New York and Pennsylvania, driven out </p><p>by the Iroquois Confederacy), carried with them </p><p>many of the customs of their original locality. One </p><p>may see the analogy between the dog-soldiers and </p><p>the Eries (cats) of the Six Nations, but the Eries </p><p>were more strictly of the medicine ilk than the dog- </p><p>soldiers. </p><p> A buck could take a scalp, make a coup, steal a</p><p>horse, kill a grizzly and get his feather, but to reach </p><p>the full rank of brave he must undergo the ordeal </p><p>of the Sun Dance, which, if he passed satisfactorily, </p><p>gave him his three feathers, marriage, the seat in </p><p>council and the right to form a band of his own and </p><p>be a chief if he could. </p><p>186 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> A STRONG high post was planted with thongs</p><p> depending from the top like a May-pole. Cer-</p><p> tain preliminaries being complied with, the medi-</p><p> dne-men slid a sharp knife under the breast muscles</p><p> and a skewer, being passed through, was attached</p><p> to the thongs. The candidate then danccd and</p><p> threw himself backward, the object being to tear or</p><p> burst the flesh and muscles and thus free him. Cut</p><p> the flesh one could not; it must be tom by your own</p><p> exertions, and if one fainted or succumbed other-</p><p> wise to the agony, he was released, dressed as, and</p><p> took his place amongst the squaws. Buffalo skulls</p><p> on thongs were sometimes similarly attached to the</p><p> muscles at the shoulder-blades and the embryo</p><p> brave danced aroimd, dragging them after him, un-</p><p> til the tortured flesh ruptured and released him.</p><p> Some took on both at once front and rear. It was</p><p> advisable to placate the medicine-man in Tam-</p><p> many fashion in order that he should not make the</p><p> slit £60 close to the bones but shallow so that by</p><p> strfong exertions the flesh could be tom in a few</p><p> ^nours or a day at most.</p><p> 'T'HE wounds left horrible scars, as any old-1 imer</p><p> can testify. Rain-in-the-Face incurred the</p><p> enmity of the conjurer who “slit” him and the latter</p><p> ran his knife close to the bone and made a very long</p><p> slit, front and back. Old Rain, however, managed</p><p> in three days to burst the last and gained a wonder-</p><p> ful renown. Rain was not a chief, but had the stand-</p><p> ing of one through his famous feat of endurance and</p><p> also his ability. He told Tom Custer he would take</p><p> his (Custer’s) heart out and eat it, which he did</p><p> later, and young Standing Horse, for one, never</p><p> blamed him for so doing. But Rain, like Bull him-</p><p> self, had no use for any white. Two wise, very wise,</p><p> and far-seeing men.</p><p> The “noblest Roman” was, of course, Red Cloud,</p><p> but he antedates the former twain. Red was never</p><p> whipped but once and then quit for good and gave</p><p> his voice for peace always. The spirit was willing</p><p> but he saw the futility of further hostilities and</p><p> bowed to the inevitable. Will some millionaire</p><p> erect a statue of him? The Lee of the Sioux.</p><p> When George Custer busted Black Kettle’s band</p><p> in Winter many Indians froze to death during the</p><p> “session” having run into the brush stark naked</p><p> from their beds with only their weapons.</p><p> rPHERE were so many delicate shades in Indian</p><p> custom that no outsider ever mastered them</p><p> all as did those to the manner or manor born.</p><p> Frank Gruard, perhaps, excepted. I wish I could</p><p> remember the buffalo hunt, the watchers, the proces-</p><p> sion to the first killed, the pipe-bearer carrying the</p><p> uncased pipe on extended palms to the carcass and</p><p> the pipe’s return in its case; the ritual on starting,</p><p> at the carcass, and the word given and the hunters</p><p> darting forward; the partition of the carcass accord-</p><p> ing to ritual, and the squaws and dogs and picka-</p><p> ninnies following to skin and carve the meat. And the</p><p> good feast afterward—hump, marrow, tongue, milk-</p><p> guts, suet and, as a bonne bouche, an unborn calf</p><p> boiled in a paunch with its contents. Everybody’s</p><p> face, hands, arms and front bloody and greasy, but</p><p> all happy. And later the squaws pounding the dried</p><p> meat and suet to powder and stuffing it into skin</p><p> and gut casings like Brobdingnagian sausage; the</p><p> pemmican that beat any soldier’s emergency ration</p><p> ever contrived; good cold and raw or cooled and hot,</p><p> strong meat for a strong people.</p><p>BUFFALO by thousands here in the hills; elk, </p><p>deer, black and white tail antelope; prairie </p><p>chicks; underfoot, camas for the digging; fish in the </p><p>streams; no game laws or wardens; a blanket or </p><p>buffalo robe, bag of salt, and gun, flint and steel and </p><p>“Paradise enow.” All gone past, as though it never </p><p>existed! In its place a bread-card, the factory whis- </p><p>tle, the big bell at the home ranch, a dad-blasted </p><p>Bostonese with his imitation English accent or a </p><p>hunk or dago or wap with a stinking devil-wagon. </p><p>Cheyenne “Ki ye yi yuii!!!” silence. “Hy yoh hy </p><p>yah hyyyy!”—Finis—Uncle Frank. </p><p>A LETTER written some months ago </p><p>from a Canadian comrade doing war </p><p>duty off the Atlantic coast, a man who was </p><p>among the salvagers after the Halifax dis- </p><p>aster: </p><p>C. D. 13, care H. M. C. S.-. </p><p> This life is dreary and montonous, drifting around</p><p>day and night in a ninety-foot boat. Overcast </p><p>skies, gray-green waves, all add to the dreariness at </p><p>this time of the year and ice-covered decks make </p><p>life miserable. And oh joy! when your shift is done, </p><p>down to the eight-by-twelve cabin and, hugging the </p><p>oil-heater and sprawled out in as comfortable a posi- </p><p>tion as you can possibly get, you grab your old </p><p>favorite magazine and follow the adventures of some </p><p>unfortunate cuss toiling through death and gore </p><p>and hairbreadth escapes! </p><p> Our boat is number thirteen and has thirteen of a</p><p>crew, and our little Hotchkis six-pounder is number </p><p>thirteen! So hooray for the hoodoo!—W. McKen- </p><p>zie Haines. </p><p>AS TO the copy of our magazine that has</p><p>had more adventures than any other </p><p>copy. That’s a hard matter on which to </p><p>get full data, but it is certainly interesting </p><p>to record the reports as they come in from </p><p>time to time: </p><p> The first Adventure I read I found in an old hut</p><p>not far from Mexico City. That was early in 1915. </p><p>I also found one that I had read in an old mine-shaft </p><p>in West Virginia. On the inside I found these words </p><p>in pencil, “Barney Mack carried this book from </p><p>China to Frisco, then here.” A rather long trip if </p><p>it’s true—Roy J. Williams. </p><p>WHAT about conditions in this country </p><p>after the war? There will be big </p><p>changes and there’s already discussion </p><p>of various problems. Good. But why talk </p><p>about doing this and that if we’re not fit </p><p>to do them? It is merely building on sand </p><p>to attempt betterments if we ourselves, </p><p>through whom they must be put into prac- </p><p>tise, are not sound and trustworthy. </p><p>No -ism or -ology or concrete improvement </p><p>ever suggested can withstand the dry-rot </p><p>of bad citizenship, of our bad citizenship. </p><p>Why not begin at the foundation?—Arthur </p><p>SuixrvANT Hoffman. </p><p>ADVENTURE'S FREE SERVICES AND ADDRESSES </p><p>These services of Adventure are free to any one.

We hope you will be patient if their answers are at </p><p>times delayed: Capt.-Adj. Joseph Mills Hanson; Capt. A. M. Lochwitzky. </p><p>The Sargasso Sea </p><p> Question:—“How large is the Sargasso Sea? Just</p><p>where is it located? Is there good foundation for </p><p>the stories of fabulous treasure to be found there? </p><p>Has any one successfully navigated this sea or </p><p>salvaged treasure from it?”—Thos. Mahoney, A. </p><p>E. F., France. </p><p> Ansiver, by Captain Dingle:—Your inquiry re-</p><p>garding the Sargasso Sea has been referred to me, </p><p>and replying I can assure you that all the tales told </p><p>of this part of the ocean are as imaginary as any </p><p>tale of a trip to the Moon or Mars. Actually the </p><p>Sargasso Sea is contained between latitudes 20° and </p><p>35° North, and longitudes 40° and about 70° West, </p><p>and is simply a vast area of slowly circling waters </p><p>formed by the influence of various great ocean </p><p>streams. </p><p> Naturally this slow revolving motion has, in the</p><p>centuries, collected a mass of weed and other float- </p><p>ing material; sometimes one may see tree-trunks, </p><p>masts, and bits of wreckage; but the area is in no </p><p>place dense enough to impede navigation, unless in </p><p>the case of a sailing ship becalmed, but a wind </p><p>strong enough to move her in clear water will drive </p><p>her through the Sargasso Sea with trifling impedi- </p><p>ment of speed. In fact, as for navigation, number- </p><p>less lines of ships pass through it every voyage; and </p><p>if any fabulous wealth lies in that part of the ocean </p><p>at all it most certainly lies at the bottom. </p><p> You may easily imagine that old-time sailors,</p><p>with their knack of creating Flying Dutchmen, </p><p>Phantom Ships, and other weird things, seeing </p><p>perhaps a derelict among all the floating weed— </p><p>which derelict might easily have been found outside </p><p>the weedy area—invented a tale of Spanish galleons </p><p>eternally revolving in this mysterious maze in mid- </p><p>ocean, laden with fabulous treasure doomed never </p><p>to sink. </p><p> Finally I will say that while of course the thick-</p><p>ness of this weed-strewn sea varies according to the </p><p>lately prevailing winds, I have passed through it </p><p>many, many times and have never seen it in such a </p><p>condition that a boat could not be rowed through it. </p><p>Diseases of East Central Africa </p><p> Question:—“I have knocked about considerably</p><p>in various countries and it has long been my desire to </p><p>visit the “Dark Continent.” I have roughed it a </p><p>great deal, am a good shot, etc., etc. </p><p> (1)	“What are health conditions aroimd and be-</p><p>tween Lakes Tanganyika and Victoria? That is, is </p><p>it a healthy region? </p><p> (2)	From an African point of view is it heavily</p><p>forested? </p><p> (3)	Is game more or less abundant there than in</p><p>other parts of the interior? Especially large game, </p><p>i. e., of cat and herb-eating species? </p><p> (4)	Can one live off the country outside medicinal</p><p>and other necessities not furnished by nature?”— </p><p>W. E. C., Belmore, Ohio. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Beadle:—(1) Health conditions</p><p>between Lakes Tanganyika and Victoria are fairly </p><p>190 </p><p>• </p><p>Adventure </p><p>bad. Malaria, spirulam, black water, and sleeping </p><p>sickness are the principal diseases. In case you </p><p>are not familiar with these I will explain briefly, </p><p>taking it for granted that you know what ma- </p><p>laria is. </p><p> Spirulam is given to man by the bite of a tick and</p><p>produces a fever very like malaria, but quinin has </p><p>no effect; it lasts some time and knocks you out, </p><p>leaving the patient usually very weak, but never </p><p>have I heard of it being fatal. </p><p> Black water is violent inflammation of the kidneys</p><p>(it is a matter of dispute whether black water is the </p><p>result of excessive malaria or not) resulting in the </p><p>urination of blood (hence the name). Very often </p><p>fatal as the patient dies of heart failure. Medicines </p><p>are calomel and purge thoroughly (stop quinin), and </p><p>as much champagne and brandy as the patient will </p><p>take with the object of keeping up the heart’s </p><p>jtfction, on which everything depends. If you get </p><p>'black water once and get over it my advice is to </p><p>clear out of the country. </p><p> Sleeping sickness is given by the bite of the</p><p>tsetse fly' (rather like a horse-fly with the wings </p><p>crossed). First produces a slight fever, headaches, </p><p>etc., and perhaps vomiting, afterward affects the </p><p>nervous system with the result that patient becomes </p><p>restless, irritable and indifferent by turns until </p><p>finally he lapses into a coma—deep—attendant with </p><p>anemia and a general wasting away. There is no </p><p>cure yet discovered. The percentage of these flies </p><p>with the germ in them ready for business is reckoned </p><p>to be about two per cent. </p><p> But still don’t run away with the idea that the</p><p>country is fatal. I’ve lived there and the only thing </p><p>I collected was malaria and not much of that. </p><p> (2)	From a general African point of view it is</p><p>fairly wooded. That is compared to the Congo </p><p>forests the forest there is slight and variable. </p><p>There are uplands with open rolling country and </p><p>scrub. </p><p> (3)	Game (large) is fairly abundant but varies</p><p>greatly. Stretches without game at all and in </p><p>other parts extremely thick—of both sorts. </p><p> (4)	No, you cannot reckon on living off the coun-</p><p>try. Chickens, eggs, and sometimes goats and milk </p><p>are obtainable at villages by trading—if the natives</p><p>happen to be friendly and they usually are if you </p><p>know the way to go about it. Game is too erratic </p><p>to rely upon. One week you may have enough to </p><p>feed a caravan to gorging and the next not enough </p><p>for a dog, and as for said villages there are large </p><p>tracts uninhabited. Sometimes you can get sweet </p><p>potatoes, but rarely in my experience. And </p><p>Nature’s supply of food for man, white men partic- </p><p>ularly, is conspicuous by its absence in most of </p><p>Africa. </p><p>Outdoor Work in Maine </p><p> Question:—“I am a young man of seventeen years</p><p>of age desirous of getting work on a farm or in a </p><p>lumber camp, in fact, anywhere where I can live and </p><p>work in the open. I am six feet tall, weigh 163 </p><p>pounds and am very strong and healthy. If you </p><p>can assist me by helping me to get work in your ter- </p><p>ritory I will be very grateful to you.”—Alexander </p><p>Eiser, Brooklyn, N. Y. </p><p> Answer, by Dr. Hathome:—There is plenty of</p><p>work to be had on the farms in Maine at the present </p><p>time, and as the season advances help will be very </p><p>scarce, from all indications. There is a great de- </p><p>mand for farm help in Aroostook County in the </p><p>northern part of the State. This is a great farming </p><p>country and the season of 1916 the farmers raised </p><p>over 16,500,000 bushels of potatoes. The draft has </p><p>taken many of the young men and the farmers will </p><p>have to depend on help either over or under the </p><p>draft age. </p><p> The Aroostook Chamber of Commerce is making</p><p>efforts at the present to get volunteers to go there </p><p>and work on the farms. </p><p> The pay will be good and pleasant homes to live</p><p>in. If I were you 1 would write direct to them at </p><p>Houlton, Maine, and they will write what the wages </p><p>will be and other particulars. </p><p> There are also many farmers in the vicinity of</p><p>Bangor that are in need of competent help. </p><p> Authority on South Sea Islands</p><p>V/f R. TOM L. MILLS writes: In a third commun- </p><p>1 ication 1 have received from Mr. A. E. B. </p><p>Baker, a most grateful Ask Adventurer who is serv- </p><p>ing on the China Naval Station, he says: </p><p> “I have just read a book, ‘In Strange South</p><p> Seas,’ by Miss Grimshaw. It is packed full of</p><p> description and information, but how far reli-</p><p> able, of course, I am not competent to say; but</p><p> it sounds to me the right dope all right.”</p><p> It has occurred to me to make a special note on</p><p>this Bakerism, for the guidance of the many Ask </p><p>Adventurers (I have had forty-five queries to answer </p><p>up to date). Miss Beatrice Gfimshaw is an English </p><p>journalist who came out to investigate the South </p><p>Sea Islands. They got her. She is enamoured of </p><p>them—and she now packs on-the-spot facts into </p><p>most attractive' fiction. She makes Sydney her </p><p>headquarters, and no woman has wandered the </p><p>South Seas to the extent of Beatrice Grimshaw, who </p><p>has even dared the interior of Papuas, the awful </p><p>Terra Incog. The late Louis Becke for South Sea </p><p>Island conditions of twenty years ago, and Ralph </p><p>Stock and Beatrice Grimshaw as modems, are good </p><p>authorities. </p><p> Editor’s Note:—“Nobody’s Island,” by Miss</p><p>Grimshaw, appeared in Advenhire for February, 1917. </p><p>Dog Travel in Alaska </p><p> Question:—“Could you tell me the difference be-</p><p>tween Eskimo dogs, huskies, and malamutes? </p><p> “What form of harness is used? What are their</p><p>capabilities regarding loads? How are they broken </p><p>in; and at what age? Would it be possible to secure </p><p>a team and have it shipped to me in Toronto? </p><p>What is a good sleigh dog worth? </p><p> “Now I am desirous of taking a trip to Alaska and</p><p>I would be pleased if you could tell me what lines </p><p>of employment would be open to me. I have lived </p><p>in a city all my life. Driving horses is my occupa- </p><p>tion and I want to get some outdoor work in the </p><p>Yukon or Alaskan country. I am twenty years </p><p>old.”—James J. Doyle, Toronto, Canada. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Solomons:—I am glad you are</p><p>interested in dog traction. It is really quite a fas- </p><p>cinating subject. </p><p> The terms “Eskimo dogs,” “huskies” and "mala-</p><p>mutes” are used interchangeably by a good many </p><p>people. The Eskimo dog is the native dog of the </p><p>Arctic and Behring Sea coasts, and may be either a </p><p>Ask Adventure </p><p>“malamute” or a “husky.” The malamute is the </p><p>wolf-fox-coyote—“outside” dog—a combination of </p><p>some or all of these (though some people deny the </p><p>fox ingredient) which both the Northern Indians in </p><p>Alaska and Canada and the Eskimos possess. </p><p> The name is that of the Malamute (variously</p><p>spelled) Indians. He is a black, black and white, </p><p>brindle, or gray or gray and white dog with more or </p><p>less small, pointed, stiff ears and pointed muzzle. </p><p>He has more or less hair on his toes and in all parts </p><p>usually lacking that protection in the ordinary dog of </p><p>southern climes. The hair is downy or furry dose </p><p>to the skin. He is a critter of considerable variety </p><p>of appearance in other respects than as to these </p><p>common features. </p><p> The husky, on the other hand, is a more or less</p><p>pure descendant of the timber-wolf and a good speci- </p><p>men of hide can not readily be distinguished from </p><p>that of a wolf. He is larger than the ordinary </p><p>Indian or Eskimo dog, in proportion as the latter </p><p>differs from him in the amount of wolf strain. He </p><p>isgray, with almost-black long hairs, which are more </p><p>abundant and longer on the ridge of the back, giving </p><p>him a much darker color when looked down upon </p><p>than in a side view. The belly is much lighter, </p><p>sometimes almost white. He is mottled, or rather </p><p>shaded to some extent, and the whole appearance of </p><p>the pelt is that of a fur. The under side of the neck, </p><p>like the belly, is light gray or whitish. The best </p><p>specimens came from the mouth of the Mackenzie </p><p>River. </p><p> The natives use the “Siwash' ’ harness. There is a</p><p>band ’round the neck, passing between the forelegs, </p><p>one band rising thence on each side, across the ribs </p><p>diagonally and coming together at the saddle of the </p><p>back where the two are joined by another connect- </p><p>ing with the back of the neckband. The three bands </p><p>are brought together, as stated, at the back and a </p><p>single trace runs back to the sled or joins another </p><p>similar trace from the dog’s mate at a distance of </p><p>several feet and the two, united in one, go back to </p><p>the sled. It is a poor arrangement. </p><p> The white man’s dog harness consists of a collar</p><p>made in much the same way as a horse collar, and </p><p>the two traces are similarly attached. At the sides </p><p>they are held in place by a back strap with a broader </p><p>part above and snapping under the belly. There is </p><p>no breeching, of course. The two traces often are </p><p>united a few feet back of the dog. </p><p> This is, in fact, the usual plan with light running</p><p>equipment, but the more careful dogmen and those </p><p>who freight loads use a singletree at the back of</p><p>the traces. This is united to the central draw-rope </p><p>by a two or two-and-a-half-foot line. Sometimes </p><p>these use a kind of doubletree which crosses the </p><p>draw-rope and is fastened to it. In short we drive </p><p>dogs much as a team or several teams of horses are </p><p>driven, and by the use of a good many German </p><p>snaps (Arctic drivers probably call them by some </p><p>other name, now) the harnessing and unharnessing </p><p>is quickly done, or the position of the pairs of dogs </p><p>quickly altered. Two and two is the usual way, </p><p>with one leader ahead. </p><p> The collars (neck collars) of the dogs are attached</p><p>to the doubletree or lead rope a foot or so ahead by a </p><p>light line of suitable length so as to prevent the dogs </p><p>from running sideways and getting too far away </p><p>from the line. The Siwash harness is not efficient, </p><p>and added to the clumsy native sleds makes the </p><p>tmlling power of the dog in actual load hauled much </p><p>ess than with the white men’s teams. </p><p>191 </p><p> Their capabilities regarding loads can only be</p><p>expressed, of course, in terms of comparison with </p><p>that of other draft animals, and as you are probably </p><p>not familiar with reindeer we will speak of horses. </p><p>Either a dog or a horse can, of course, keep almost </p><p>any amount of load moving on glare ice, once the </p><p>load is started. But on a level, hard, snow trail at </p><p>moderate temperatures, say zero or a bit wanner </p><p>and especially if there is a little sun on the trail a </p><p>team of dogs each averaging seventy-five pounds in </p><p>weight will keep a load moving all day that weighs </p><p>three limes the weight of the dogs. This feat </p><p>makes him, I should say, the most wonderful draft </p><p>animal we know anything about. </p><p> The best I ever got out of horses—and I handled a</p><p>hundred picked animals one Winter under various </p><p>conditions—was about nine tons per six-horse </p><p>team, on a similar snow trail. The horses averaged Q </p><p>shade under one thousand five hundred pounds </p><p>apiece, so they drew about twice their own weight, </p><p>but they couldn’t keep it up the way the dogs do. </p><p> Under less favorable trail conditions and in colder</p><p>weather the dogs will average twice their own weight, </p><p>and under almost any conditions on a broken trail, </p><p>and day in and day out, twelve and fourteen hours a </p><p>day, up hill and down dale, they will lug their own </p><p>weight. On the Arctic we feed them a half a dried </p><p>salmon every night and on hard work a bit also at </p><p>noon. A pound to two and one-half pounds a day, </p><p>depending on the dryness of the food, the size of the </p><p>dog, the coldness of the weather, etc.—that is about </p><p>the ration. A horse “packs” better than a dog,</p><p>however. </p><p> The natives break in the pups by letting them run</p><p>along at first, and then tying them to the sled, at </p><p>first behind, then alongside of their mother or father </p><p>in the team. They soon begin to pull from imita- </p><p>tion and from a natural pup-desire to go faster and </p><p>see what the next turn of the trail will develop in the </p><p>way of interesting or eatable sights. </p><p> The team is guided entirely by the leader who lis-</p><p>tens for “gee” and “haw,” “mush” (get-up) and </p><p>“whoa.” I had a leader that I trained to “gee-a- </p><p>little.” It had come to be a nuisance to “gee,” and </p><p>have him turn too much to the right and then </p><p>“haw” him back part way (a stupid dog will haw </p><p>clear back and then some, but a sensible one will get </p><p>the idea). So when I wanted him to veer off a few </p><p>points, as a sailor would say, I added the “a little.” </p><p>If I wanted a right angle turn I said, “gee,” and if I </p><p>wanted to turn clear round I said, “gee-round.” </p><p> I have no doubt you could get a dog-tcam from</p><p>upper Canada. It would be too uncertain and ex- </p><p>pensive to get a team from the Yukon or Alaska. </p><p>A good sleigh dog is usually worth fifty to one </p><p>hundred dollars, but very fair ones can be bought </p><p>for much less. It depends on when, where and how </p><p>the purchase is made. In the Spring dogs are </p><p>naturally cheaper than at the beginning of Winter. </p><p> Of course you can get work in Alaska, just as</p><p>anywhere else. And good “skinners” are usually in </p><p>demand. If you like the outdoors and are strong </p><p>and energetic and used to working with your hands </p><p>you will have no trouble in Dawson, Y. T., or any- </p><p>where in the Alaskan camps. Winter freighting </p><p>with horses has superseded that with dogs in all the </p><p>well-established camps, but dogs continue to be the </p><p>only means in the smaller and newer districts—or </p><p>at least the principal means, for there is usually </p><p>a stray horse or two wherever a group of men are to </p><p>be found. </p><p>192 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>LOST </p><p>TRAILS </p><p> Note—Wc offer this department of the "Camp-Fire” free of charge to those of our read-</p><p>ers who wish to get in touch again with old friends or acquaintances from whom the years </p><p>have separated them.
