As</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long as we bear these buzzes we'll know at least that he is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What good will that do?" Tom spoke up, "What we should</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have done was to trail him in another ship, and be nearby if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he got into trouble.71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And lose two more planes instead of one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Not necessarily--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ''Listen, Tom, you have your ideas as to what is playing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">havoc on this line as well as I. Now I'm going to tell you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fellows what my idea is, and my reasons for it"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shoot," was Jim's brief comment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well, did you fellows ever hear of Skeleton Valley?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Sure," Jim again replied. "The line passes over it It's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a sort of cavern, as seen from the air, about a mile wide and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">around twenty or more long and plenty deep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And have you ever heard any rumors about the place?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"There have been yarns around that the jungle natives won't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">go near the place on account of some sort of spirit devils that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are supposed to live in the valley," offered Tom. "But yon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">can't believe any native superstitions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "As a rule, no. But in this case perhaps we can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I mean that a place such as that valley, miles from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nearest white man and, shunned by the natives, would be an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">excellent spot for a nest of air bandits."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Great Scott!" exclaimed Jim. "Air bandits out here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I had that idea too," Tom offered. "These ships are carry-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing some valuable mail including the diamond shipments and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">payrolls between these two fields. But I doubt if there could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be much air gunning done without being seen by some natives,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and in that case the news would soon reach the settlements."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, if they used guns; but suppose our air bandits were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scientific enough to have a ray that could demagnetize or burn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out the generators and electrical systems of the planes, then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the ships would just naturally become paralyzed when they hit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the beam, and glide down into the valley to crash against the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rock walls or crumple up on the floor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THE others remained silent as Watson paused in his talk,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and for the space of a few minutes only the buzz-buzz</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the little device on the wall broke the stillness. Then the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chief continued:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If a man really did invent a beam of such a nature and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">determined to keep his discovery a secret and use it criminally</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to his own personal benefit, then there could be no better place</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to try out such a device, with minimum chances of detection,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than in Skeleton Valley."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It sounds reasonable all right," Tom agreed, "As far as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">possibilities of such being done in the valley. But," he added,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Any man inventing a beam like that would not be likely to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">use it in such a way. Why, he could sell the rights to such</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an invention for a good fortune."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, that's true, but some men having a criminal streak in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them, would rather use their discovery the illegal way just for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ihc excitement that it offers. Anyway, it seems to be the most</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reasonable explanation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It looks as though you've hit it, chief," Jim spoke up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Everything points that way. Your idea would help explain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">why the boys have so many electrical troubles. Take Weldon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for instance; it was in the Skeleton Valley area that he lost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the beam and found his compass useless. No doubt they tried</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to bring him down, but outside of paralyzing his instruments,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they were unable for some reason to stop him. Then there's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Simpson; his whole radio outfit went deader'n a tack hammer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in that neighborhood. Whether it's a ray that is causing all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this havoc or not is hard to say, but it sure begins to look that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">way. That would explain why nothing happens when the gov-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ernment planes'make the run."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, those other ships went down during storms," Watson</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">commented. "That would be just the time for bandits to bring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">. down a plane, causing the rest of the world to believe that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">storm had forced her down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Weldon will soon be pulling up over that valley now," Tom</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said. "He can't be more than a hundred miles from her now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to stick around until he gets past."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well I'm not figuring on leaving here for a while myself,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jim replied walking over to examine a large map of the route</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hanging on the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Story of Skeleton Valley</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THE next moment the loud speaker of the radio set filled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the room with its roar, and the three men turned as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one toward the instrument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Kimberley Air Field 64. Hello Watson." The well known</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">voice of Weldon came from the speaker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Quickly throwing the changeover switch of the antenna to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the transmitting side, Watson at once answered the call, then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">switched the receiver into circuit again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Got you 0.

That's where this tropical weather gets my goat. You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">start out with a clear signal and within an hour you're bucking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the worst storm that ever hit your blades."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "If he can only keep to the beam," Tom replied, "He'll have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little to fear from the storm, for these Greysons can outride</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">anything short of a tornado."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, but about every third storm around here is a tornado."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Say, chief," Tom turned to Watson, "Where did they get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the name Skeleton Valley?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, as near as I can tell you, that name started from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reports from natives that no man or beast entering that valley</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ever returned; and that the floor was practically covered with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the bones of those caught in theft;."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Of course." Jim spoke up, "these yarns are exaggerated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">due to the superstitious nature of the blackies, but still, you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will find that whenever they put their taboo on a place there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is often some reason for it outside of imaginative ones."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Approaching close to bad storm," Weldon's voice came from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the wireless receiver, "Beam signals weak, motors perfect, com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pass is acting queer.

Rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell in torrents, cooling off the hot stifling air and causing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted drop in temperature. Lightning cut vividly across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black thunderheads above the ship, and deafening crashes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder echocd between the clouds and the dark dismal land</seg><seg type="columnLine">below. The swift speed of the ship however, soon put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm behind them, and again the clear soft tropical sky with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its millions of sparkling gems looked down on the racing</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jim," Tom spoke through the phone circuit, "Better call</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief and tell him that everything is 0.

It's likely spread right</seg><seg type="columnLine">across our route and this field is not only deflecting all radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">signals that strike it, causing poor communication between you</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the coast, but it is also the cause of our ships coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. As soon as they enter this field, their electrical equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, which includes radio, motor ignition and the guiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam, become demagnetized or depolarized in some way, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">all delicate magnetic and electric instruments such as the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass, become useless."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By Jove, Tom, your idea fills the bill all right.

But how in the mischief can any white man produce a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic magnetic field like that in the air?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How can a man in Wew York see what's going on in London</seg><seg type="columnLine">by means of a lot of electrical apparatus?

A small dark hud-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dled object lay motionless half way to the white object, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jim grasped his rifle firmly. The shadow of the cloud again</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swept down over Skeleton Valley, and he saw the dark object</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">move.

The other two were very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">small boats, scarcely larger than a rowboat, equipped with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very light motors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The ship itself was one of the most modern in the whaling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">industry, having an electric light plant and the most modern</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of whale-handling machinery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was no ceremony about our departure, when every-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">body was aboard, we simply shoved off from the little quay</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and steamed out to sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The first few days out were quite uneventful. My assistant,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Willard, became deathly seasick; and it fell to my lot, there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">being no doctor or stewards on board, to act in the capacity</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of both.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After perhaps a fortnight we arrived on the outskirts of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the feeding ground of the whales; but as there were no whales</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in sight, we kept on; always traveling in a northerly direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In order to save coal we now hoisted sail and continued our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">northward journey in long zigzag tracks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Not long after this we sighted our first whale; and Wiliard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and I were treated to our first sight of a whaling crew in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">action.

They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are the survivals of the time when it was a land animal and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vwalked about the swamps and marshes, foraging for tender</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reeds or tall rushes, and having no thought of the time when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the land should rise so high as to dissipate the swamps and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deposit the glaciers of an ice age in their place and leave the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">poor whale no alternative but to take to the water or perish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We were also much interested in the food substances taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the great stomach. All the whalebone whales, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of that description--live entirely on plankton, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they find floating in vast fields on or near the surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Plankton is made up of vegetable matter, such as diatoms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">together withjjlue-green algae, with a liberal mixture of minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals, mostly protozoa, and a seasoning of fish eggs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many kinds of larvae.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  These the whale scoops up in his great mouth, together with</seg><seg type="columnLine">much sea water. Upon closing his mouth, the water is strained</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the fine whalebone fibres and the plankton retained,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the water is discarded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                A Killing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE biggest whales live the farthest north, the Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured us.

We were therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">obliged to change our course and steam out around the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moving mass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whales had in the meantime traveled several miles on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They kept to the open water, however, and by dint of liberal</seg><seg type="columnLine">stoking we were soon near enough to make the attack by motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Willard was eager to take to the boat with the crew, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain objected; saying that a little boat, which the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">mishap might capsize, was no place for a land lubber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In breathless suspense we watched the boat approach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">largest of the whales.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was a sight long to be remembered. The giant mate stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the harpoon gun, directing the management of the boat, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a voice that came booming back to us over the crests of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean swells. The swells lifted the boat high in air and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent it careening down the side of a deep trough, only to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitate a moment before being lifted again to another crest</seg><seg type="columnLine">It did not seem possible that one could aim or fire a gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">accurately from such an unstable craft especially in a sea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such great power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT times the great bodies of the whales were completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">_ submerged; then again a portion of a long back with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small fin would protrude above the surface amid a swirl of</seg><seg type="columnLine">foam. Or a trough between the waves would reveal a vast ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panse of a bluish grey, gliding body. Or maybe a great back</seg><seg type="columnLine">would hump up in a ponderous curve; then the long posterior</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion of the great length would flow--flow is the only word</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it--in a sounding maneuver, the unseen head perhaps search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the depths for some special plankton.

As it hung poised for an instant on the crest, a short</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  line of blue-white smoke shot toward the whale; and a moment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  later the quick, sharp detonation of the harpoon gun rang out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  over the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    The great tail flukes lashed the water to foam; and the whale</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  shot forward with tremendous speed. We saw the coils of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  the harpoon line leap into the air and straighten out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Then a muffled thud seemed to come from nowhere in par-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ticular, just as the whale bounded with a mighty flourish of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  his spreading flukes, high in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "That was explosive in the harpoon. They have made a fair</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  hit," said the Captain excitedly. "He is our meat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Speedily we were under way, and the little boat was coming</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  to meet us; paying out the great coil of rope as it came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   A line was dropped overboard and the whale line quickly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  snatched up and attached to the forward winch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The Captain was now too busy giving orders to answer any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  questions, but as the huge mate appeared over the side, Willard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  had this one for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Do you think the whale is dead?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Yes, dead as a mackerel," lie answered confidently. And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  so it proved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    As the winch got to work, the line came steadily reeling in,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  as if dragging a dead load; and soon we saw the dark carcass</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  approaching the side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   As it broke water alongside, it assumed unbelievably huge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  proportions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    "That is at least a whale and a half," said the Captain. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Museum will have to build on an addition in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">* house him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Indeed it seemed as though such would be the case; for this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  monster of the deep so far outran our previous conceptions</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  of great mammals that we could scarcely credit our eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   As we gazed in pop-eyed astonishment the sailors were busy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  making the huge carcass fast alongside, for any attempt to hoist</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  such a leviathan on deck was obviously out of the question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Stout nets were brought up from below and spread under</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  the whale to insure it against the onslaughts of sharks or killer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  whales, after having first inflated the carcass with air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   And now, for the first time since putting out the boat, we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  took thought of our surroundings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ice-Bound</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  TO the south of us the ice floe we had earlier encountered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  had assumed startling proportions.

Thus all chance of returning the way</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  we had come was cut off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   To make matters worse, a blinding snowstorm came driving</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  down from the pole;

and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about us .was one vast field of dead, motionless snow and ice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ship and the great whale were firmly fixed in the ice, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply rifted with snow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were a glum and discouraged little band that busied</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves shoveling snow all the morning, while the Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">took bearings and tried to locate our position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From our deductions we find that we are perilously far</seg><seg type="columnLine">north," the Captain reported, "in fact a long way further than</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had suspected."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">What Hope?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUR only hope of release was that a mild turn of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather or a great storm might sooner or later open</seg><seg type="columnLine">to warmer seas the path through which we had arrived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Uneventful, cold and miserable were the weeks and months</seg><seg type="columnLine">that followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although our ship had been liberally stored with blankets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clothing, and although we had bought a few raw furs</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we had touched the coast of Labrador, we were yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitifully supplied for the rigors of the long, dark Arctic winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would shortly be upon us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently there was no game to be had;

And if one</seg><seg type="columnLine">could bring himself to overlook a certain amount of smoke and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumes, together with an unbelievably rank odor, the mate's</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts may be said to have been successful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As winter set in, we fell into fairly routine habits. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning was given over to such work as was necessary about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship; preparing food, making additional clothing and various</seg><seg type="columnLine">other chores; while the latter part of the day--if one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">call those dark stretches days--was free for each man to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he liked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At such times the officers and men usually devoted them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves to card playing and checkers; while Willard and I read</seg><seg type="columnLine">the technical books that he had so providentially brought along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or held long discussions about many things, more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We racked our brains and searched all our books for knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of radio.

For we were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long way from the most northern grounds that we had intended</seg><seg type="columnLine">to visit; and the charts and maps of a whaling vessel are ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">narily very sketchy and inadequate as-regards land formations</seg><seg type="columnLine">in partially explored districts. Ours were no exception.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  However, as the long period of darkness drew to a close,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we laid definite plans for sending out exploring and rcconnoitcr-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing expeditions; and the giant mate set to work to improvise</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple of ice sledges, while other members of the crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">strove to produce various parts of the necessary equipment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as sled harness and poles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was finally determined to divide the men into two equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">parties; one of which should stay with tHe ship, prepared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breaking up of the ice, or any other emergency; while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others should go forth to explore 011 a trip calculated to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">not more than a week at most; always making a rough chart</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their route and keeping an eye open for any possibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fish or game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At the first peep of the sun over the southern horizon, I set</seg><seg type="columnLine">off with the rest of the party; laden with provisions, guns, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mariner's compass and one pair of the ship's binoculars. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause I had appeared somewhat apt with the pencil, I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">chosen as official routc-charter for the expedition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I will pass over the events of this expedition, and several</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar ones of the following weeks; because they were quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">unproductive of any tangible results, except as they revealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that we were in the midst of a vast area of unbroken</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice and snow, and that there was no land or open water within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a radius of at least a hundred miles I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IF the weather was too stormy, the men often suffered severely</seg><seg type="columnLine">from exposure and frost-bite; and if it was fair and clear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they often suffered from snowblindness, since we had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">three pairs of colored glasses and one pair of ordinary spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacles which we smoked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At last, near the close of the season, and after a great storm,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an exploring party reported seeing a lane of open water several</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">miles away to the west of our position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Great excitement prevailed, and hope ran high that the lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">would spread in our direction and release us from our bondage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But nothing of the sort happened. On the contrary, scouts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sent to watch developments reported that the lane was growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrower, and freezing over again at the near end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of the men, and especially the giant mate, grew quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate in the face of this disappointment; and declared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking one of the two small boats and making a dash for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open sea. It was evident that this was going to be the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of the year.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Captain demurred; saying that one of the small boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be expected to live out the rough seas, and besides</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could not carry water and provisions for more than two or</seg><seg type="columnLine">three days. But he agreed that if the large whaling boat could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be transported to open water, he would consent to allow at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least a part of the men to make the attempt; although it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing short of foolhardy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holvever, the distance was so great, and the boat was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy that it appeared like an almost impossible portage. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant mate, whose optimism and good nature rose superior</seg><seg type="columnLine">to every obstacle, declared that the boat should go, if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry it on his shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He ordered the fire started in the forge, and all the steel rod</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">harpoon stock brought up from the hold. Then with the help</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the blacksmith and the carpenter, he set to work to fashion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">steel-shod sleigh runners for the bottom of the boat. He de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tailed other men to erect a mast. Everyone joined in the work</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the desperation of hope long deferred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Decision</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT the end of twenty-four hours, during which everybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">, had worked frantically, the ice ship was rigged with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sail and runners and was ready for the journey. The cook</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared a hearty meal and we prepared to turn in. For my</seg><seg type="columnLine">part, I was so exhausted that rest seemed impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the question arose, who should go, and who should stay ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Captain declared that his place was with the ship; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that any inclined to brave the hardship of a voyage in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">open boat in an Arctic sea were at liberty to do so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willard and I held a conference. All day I had been un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided whether to join the desperate party or stay with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship on a chance of future deliverance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willard seemed quite decided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us not desert the whale," he said.

"When the whal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing boat is gone--if indeed it does go, which I very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt--there will be no possibility of our leaving the ship by</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of water; and we might be imprisoned here until we die.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our supplies cannot last forever. Are you willing to give up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance for life just for the sake of an overgrown whale?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he answered stoutly, "Scientists have given their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives for far less."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, Willard," I said, holding out my hand, "we stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the whale."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some half dozen of the men had already declared their</seg><seg type="columnLine">intention of going.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although so much had been accomplished, the mate was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to call it a day.

By the time I was half way back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ship, I commenced to feel the strain occasioned by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad going; and my decision to unload the bird and the gun for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short rest brings us back to the opening of this story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I removed one glove and stroked the glossy feathers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">owl. How thick and smooth they seemed I That wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothness was like something I had felt years ago. A mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment's reflection sufficed to recall--it was the smoothness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear end of the tote poles the Indians used when I was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy on the Western plains. Many miles of sliding through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buffalo grass gave just that absolutely smooth polish. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered how cumbersome a load an Indian pony, or for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the want of a pony an Indian squaw, could pull across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prairie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Well, here was a thought. Why not drag the great bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the snow ? With such an opportunity as this, there seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no logical reason why I should carry him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I remembered having a string in my pocket I felt for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yes, it was there; a strong piece of fish cord. I brought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and throwing one glove down to protect my knee from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow, knelt beside the bird and proceeded to make a knot about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his neck. Then, fearing that the cord would injure the feathers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I brought from an inner pocket a portion of a blue bandana</seg><seg type="columnLine">handkerchief and inserted it under the cord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  How much, I wondered, could the live bird have carried on</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a string while in flight. I thought of the weight that an</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplane could carry; then of the load of a balloon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then, as little pictures sometimes float through the mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">just before we go to sleep, I saw a long dirigible balloon in</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight It was close down to the horizon, scarce clearing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure ridges. It passed by a little cloud and emerged; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">now it was not the form of a balloon, but that of a large whale I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With a start I strove to collect my senses. Surely, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreaming! Whales did not fly. Besides, I was not looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about me, but down at the great owl. Could it be that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">freezing, and dropping to sleep as men do when they are over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come by cold and fatigue?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had I been unconscious of the passage of time and become</seg><seg type="columnLine">chilled unawares?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I LEAPED to my feet, and swung my arms and beat my</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest. I found I had no numbness in my hands or feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my limbs were not stiff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Surely I must have been the victim of an hallucination. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">why should I visualize a whale in flight above this expanse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ice and snow?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, perhaps I had been thinking a great deal about our</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant whale, having little else to occupy my thoughts for many</seg><seg type="columnLine">months. Besides, after several years of seeing nothing but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">encircling vastness, one could not be expected to keep the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">time grip on his mental reactions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet, after all, I thought, as I put on my glove and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a hand loop in the string, a dirigible does very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">resemble a whale. They are of much the same shape, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">both have steering fins and tail flukes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  If only our giant were a dirigible, instead of a dead whale:</seg><seg type="columnLine">how gladly would we sail back to God's country!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And then the important thing happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">One eminent scientist has said that perhaps the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ARCTIC RESCUE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">981</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle of all Nature's wonders is the birth of a thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The whale would make a good balloon! Would it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I spoke half aloud, while my thoughts flew feverishly on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">consider details of lifting gas, motive power, and navigating</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, it might really be possible. Here at last was hope I I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was conscious of a great glow of excitement. My heart was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating furiously, and I felt the hot blood rushing up my netk</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was spurred to action. The first thing was to tell my com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rades about it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 snatched up my gun and ran for the ship, trailing the owl</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently I slowed down to a brisk walk; for I saw the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the distance, and on the deck I thought I could make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forms of Willard and the Captain looking at me through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glasses. It struck me that I must present rather an incon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gruous spectacle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What would they think of me, capering along and dragging</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bird behind me? Would they think me demented?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Really, if they did it would be deuced awkward; especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the idea which I had to propose to them was at best quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinary. It would be an awkward situation indeed if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they should become convinced tliat I was mentally deranged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that my brilliant plan was only the ravings of a maniac.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went back over the happenings of the last few days, scru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinizing my actions to see if there could have been anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">about my conduct that could have seemed queer. Happily I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could think of nothing out of the ordinary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, I resolved that I would not spring my idea upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them until any false impressions that they might have received</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have had time to pass off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At least it would be best to wait a day or two and think it</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, so as to prepare a logical presentation of the subject In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meantime perhaps I could lead the talk to dirigibles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe suggest the thought without actually putting it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I decided that the best course for the present would be to</seg><seg type="columnLine">evince a great enthusiasm for my rare specimen of owl, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">indulge in a bit of good humor and high spirits as a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">celebration of my good luck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Launching of the Idea</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO my relief upon arriving I iound both the Captain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willard intensely interested in the bird; after laughing</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-naturedly at my unique method of transportation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willard, true to his naturalistic instincts, was interested in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch as a specimen of the fauna of the far North.

I will venture</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say that when it was completed it was the only well in</seg><seg type="columnLine">982</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the ocean then in use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since the ice that forms on salt water is practically free</seg><seg type="columnLine">from salt--containing only one fifth of the original salt--</seg><seg type="columnLine">we knew that melting the ice so abundant all around us would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not produce the brine we needed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ice was not so deep as I had anticipated; and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the second day 1 had at our disposal a limitless supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">of both salt and water, in a pukka well, all rigged with a wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lass for hauling up buckets and a battering ram for breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ice as often as it tormed on the surface of the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More than a month was consumed in perfecting apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">and experimenting on the production of gas; but after much</seg><seg type="columnLine">toil and many discouragements we finally succeeded in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structing a device which, although not very efficient, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of producing a small volume of hydrogen gas that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would float improvised paper balloons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now we were ready for the great task of separating</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Whale from his skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was decided to excavate the remainder of the flesh, blubber</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bones, by a process of mining. Most of the blubber we</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended to bum in our boilers to furnish power for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">generator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortunately we had a goodly supply of tools; and we set</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work with a will. But we soon found that our muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">were soft, and we were in poor condition for such exhausting</seg><seg type="columnLine">manual labor. However, since there were no time limits on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our operations, we could work only a few hours a day; gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally increasing the length of our forenoon and afternoon shifts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The method adopted was to leave a wall of several inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the frozen blubber all around the outside, so that the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face would remain rigid until the major part of the material</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been removed. Then to go over the entire surface again</seg><seg type="columnLine">very carefully, removing all the blubber and leaving only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin skin; putting in struts and props the while, so that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure would not collapse with its own weight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before starting this last process we spent several weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">chopping the ice away from the carcass and introducing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">layer of cinders and ashes beneath it, to prevent its adhering</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its support</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The weeks lengthened into months while we were still en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaged in this work. But as our muscles hardened and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">project developed, our spirits improved; and we no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutinized ourselves and each other for signs of dawning</seg><seg type="columnLine">insanity. It was evident that the game was worth the candle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though it might culminate in total failure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN, after what seemed an age, the skin was empty;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the mouth and eye and other openings secured with</seg><seg type="columnLine">paraffme-treated canvas. Fortunately the ship had been stocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with enough canvas for two new sets of sail, besides the ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">in use. We used a large part of this canvas for a temporary</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We decided to commence filling the "blimp" with gas at once;</seg><seg type="columnLine">because we knew that the production of such an enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of gas with our meagre facilities would be a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">process; long enough no doubt to afford ample time to build</seg><seg type="columnLine">our gondola, steering and propelling apparatus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a great deal of difficulty we succeeded in improvising</seg><seg type="columnLine">a movable canvas partition with an air-inflated border, calcu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated to move along the interior of the huge creature, confining</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gas on one side and expelling the air on the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then we put the generator into operation. This plant was</seg><seg type="columnLine">destined to stay in service night and day for weeks, producing</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas slowly but steadily while we worked and while we slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We used our masts and most of the rope and wire on board</seg><seg type="columnLine">to build a contraption to hold the great bag to earth after it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was partly inflated but not yet ready for flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then we constructed the lightest possible gondola; using the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long strips of whalebone from the whale's mouth for braces</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and struts and canvas sails for sides and covering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Next we took the light gasoline engine out of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little boats and rigged it to a hand-carved propeller made from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a part of a mast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  By this time the bow of the whale was raised as high as its</seg><seg type="columnLine">moorings would permit; and we installed the operating devices</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hung the gondola beneath--all made from odds and ends</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ship. Our steering apparatus was especially primi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive. It consisted simply of small wire cables running through</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulleys and attached to the whale's fins by means of sheets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin made from fruit containers laced to the fins with fish cord.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These lines were operated by crude wooden levers, and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of moving the fins only a little way. Fortunately a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whale's flukes are horizontal instead of vertical as fishes' tails</seg><seg type="columnLine">are. The somewhat cumbersome device that we arranged was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to move these a great deal, because of their lack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flexibility. But we could move them some, and we hoped suffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciently to enable us to at least partially govern our horizontal</seg><seg type="columnLine">course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Whale Takes the Air!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> SAY we hoped; to hope was manifestly all we could ilo</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the efficiency of our improvised equipment</seg><seg type="columnLine">Obviously there could be no trial flights. When once</seg><seg type="columnLine">we left our icebound whaling ship our only hope would be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">good luck and a kind Providence; for we had no landing gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pull us to a mooring mast, and no hangar in which to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">alterations or repairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We did indeed have a valve in the gas compartment, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a pump-suckcr, with which we might contrive to- let our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves down. But we knew we would be able to carry prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically no ballast. If our calculations, taken from the industrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemistry book were right, it would be enough if we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift ourselves and a small supply of gasoline and provisions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were now in high spirits; for it was daily becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">more evident that our balloon was going to at least rise from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When all the major devices were installed, we could see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would still be quite a number of days before the gas bag was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled to capacity. So while the Captain was busy installing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his compass and other navigating instruments Willard and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">were occupied in painting the name of our dirigible, The Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">IVhale in huge letters on a great canvas banner. This we in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended to unfurl as soon as we were really on our way--if and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then we declared a holiday, and held a formal christening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There remained but three bottles of wine in the ship's medical</seg><seg type="columnLine">stores, and we emptied one of these, and ceremoniously broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottle over the new ship. Every one present seemed satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied with this arrangement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Midsummer was now approaching; and we set the 23rd of</seg><seg type="columnLine">July for our departure; provided of course that our supply of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas was then adequate, and the wind favorable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Captain completed his Jog, and we all wrote letters to</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends and relatives to be left at the ship. For we hoped that</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time airmen or explorers might find the deserted hulk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry our communications back to civilization, even if we our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves never arrived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I also prepared a report to the museum; describing our whale,</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving measurements and other scientific data that I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be of interest to naturalists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning of July 23rd was disappointing. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">little wind; and our smoke indicated further that it was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wrong direction, traveling toward the Pole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But as the morning wore on, the breeze died entirely; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at about eleven o'clock a light breeze started from the oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">site direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ARCTIC RESCUE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">983</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF course we had no means of observing in which direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion the currents were moving in the upper air; but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to take a chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We descended to the galley and ate a hasty lunch; stowed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">generous basket of cooked food and an emergency kit in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gondola, and prepared to cast off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were a few moments of dramatic suspense as one by</seg><seg type="columnLine">one we pulled the lines that untied the slip-knots that held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bag to earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last one large rope made fast to the gondola and attached</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an iron pin in the ice was all that held us to terra firma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, here's to a prosperous voyage," said the Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly; and leaning over with his long knife he cut the rope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a wild lurch the buoyant craft lifted far above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old whaling vessel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But evidently we had made a mistake in locating our gondola.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was so far forward that the bow end of the whale was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed, and the tail flaunted high in air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope the old fool isn't getting ready to sound," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe she will do better when we get the propeller going,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Willard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To our great satisfaction we continued to rise until we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps three or four hundred feet in the air, and then com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced drifting, broadside to the wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well. let's see if we can navigate her," said the Captain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Willard, who now styled himself chief engineer, started</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiny engine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the propeller developed speed we commenced to turn tail</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the wind and the forward end rose until we were almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">on an even keel.

Besides, we knew in which direction the wind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">blowing at this level, and we didn't want to take a chance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">encountering adverse currents in the upper levels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We at length succeeded in stabilizing our course at what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">judged to be an elevation of about a quarter of a mile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the wind continued to rise. It whistled shrilly through</seg><seg type="columnLine">our rigging; and we began to fear that it would become so</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong as to batter our hand-made craft to pieccs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had no idea how much pressure our thin, fibreless gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">bag would stand without buckling.

Color was of no consequence to these broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visioned men who, as representatives of the various races of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth, bespoke the new understanding of this great truth. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentor (the Planet Ruler assumed this title and name on taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">office) was a man of some fifty years, as fine a figure of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man as could be found upon the planet. His hair was as crisp</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a youth's and his eyes were dark wells of understanding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His face was the face of a leader, but his leadership was tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered with a compassion for those he ruled. He stood a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches over six feet and the great wings that rose from between</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder-blades had a span, when open, of twenty feet;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for with the centuries the wings of the aloted had grown in</seg><seg type="columnLine">size. Those of the Mentor were covered with golden-brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">feathers that were soft and silky to the touch. His clothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was close-fitting, the garments affording a minimum of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistance to the wind, and to lessen that resistance still more</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were made of a sleek silky material. In color they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinted a delicate shade of yellow that blended well with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden-brown of the wings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The other men at his table differed but little from the Mentor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Their wings, it is true, were of a variety of colors--some solidly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hued, some variegated--and their clothing usually was pig-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mented to correspond to the wing coloring, for the winged</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">people liked harmony of color, learned, as it were, from Nature's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">carefully manipulated brush. The only radical difference to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be noted in the group was their racial colorings, and each one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was the finest specimen of his own race. Their faces were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">usually very regular in contour, for with the knowledge that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it is possible to grow new parts upon their bodies had come the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of perfecting their physical features, until, except</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in color, they were almost counterparts of one another. Gone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was the racial flatness of the Chinese face and its bland in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scrutable eyes, while the Negro had as regular, clear-cut features</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as the Englishman who sat beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They Must Be Saved!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OW ihe Patriarch was speaking again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Something must be done immediately about our</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, my friends, else we shall find ourselves a doomed race.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It means race suicide to continue as we are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"There has been talk, Mentor, of sending out an expedition</seg><seg type="columnLine">to other planets in search of more women!"

"The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only solution that I can see is one that should not be considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">except in the most extreme circumstances. Yet, it may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the time has come when we must admit that course.

In this</seg><seg type="columnLine">way we may hope to save these millions of women who will go</seg><seg type="columnLine">inevitably to their deaths. For although a mother may escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one child, statistics prove that either the second, third,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth or fifth child invariably brings her to her death! We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have tried every other means we know, but every experiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">proves a failure I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am certain that the answer lies rather in our seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">women from one of the known inhabited planets, Mentor,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisted the Chinese president</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again the Mentor shook his head. 'You may be correct,</seg><seg type="columnLine">President Chang, but even if you were right, where is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of our crossing space to another planet?

"In Japan there is a group of men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell us that they have perfected such a machine, sir I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mentor jerked to alertness. "What do you mean ? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">have I not been informed of this?" His eyes blazed, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">although the protectorate was not severe with the nations, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet ruler must needs know all the events worthy of note</seg><seg type="columnLine">without fail. For only in that manner was it possible to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world balanced, and to administer to one nation as to an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, so that jealousies and antipathies might not be given</seg><seg type="columnLine">encouragement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The reports have been duly submitted at Havana, Mentor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even now they probably repose in your files.

For an hour or so they sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the roof listening to the music of the trained players.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And all over the globe Earthlings were listening to the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">music, if such was their wish, through the radio sets. Or they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could switch on their Visual-screens and see their leaders sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting together. The world was aware that the ten were gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">here together, and were anxiously -awaiting some portent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">good news.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now in the sky there were hundreds of people who sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to catch a glimpse of their leaders. The manner in which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied their curiosity was not trying to the potentates, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying people did not ogle, but flew quietly by. Some dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers on the roof's tiled floor and the awnings as they passed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but these attentions were paid in a disctjeet manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the sun climbed higher and higher, the fans were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to prevent the air under the awnings from becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm; so after their meal was over the Mentor suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they descend to the garden below. Descent was made</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the shaft by which they had arrived. During a rain a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass roof slid across the shaft top to protect those moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">from floor to floor, but at other times the shafts were open</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sky, for the winged people more often left their buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">by way of these shafts than through the. doorway on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground floors. The full length windows of the chambers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">also used for exits and entrances. In the private buildings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">homes the same features existed, and the old Spanish type of</seg><seg type="columnLine">building with its inner palio open to the sky was well suited</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the flying people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus the party dropped the five floors and emerged into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool garden shaded by a movable roof. There they sat for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several hours discussing questions that had come up in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">various domains. At four they left the governmental building</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the beautiful one-floored home of the Mentor where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a siesta. There they met the beautiful mate of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentor, his three sons and one daughter. The family name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet ruler was Page, although in his official capacity he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was known as "the Mentor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were no other women in the home beside the wife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter. Nor were there any other servants than the mechani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal robots that had been perfected to such a high degree of</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficiency that the care of the house and the kitchen was left</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them. The housewife had only to set their dials for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prescribed task and knew it would be carried out far better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any human servant could do it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That evening, after the dinner in the Mentor's well appointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, they listened to a program of music, then watched some</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing and a drama that was being enacted at one of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio broadcasting stations of the world. Needless to say, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">two centuries now a universal tongue bad been adopted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was spoken all over the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The following morning the Mentor's nine guests bade him</seg><seg type="columnLine">farewell and with the coming of the sun were ready to return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their own capitals. This was to be accomplished by wing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one by one the presidents, each accompanied by his per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal retinue, departed cither for the East, the West, the North</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the South.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were thousands of the winged people abroad at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">early hour, for they were early risers, and with flowers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">songs saw the departing administrators on their way into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Space-Flyer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AN hour later the Mentor was again in his office, and before</seg><seg type="columnLine">. him was spread the report of the invention of the Japanese</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists. Already the clerk who had been at fault in not</seg><seg type="columnLine">informing the Mentor of its arrival had been demoted. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">studying the plans the Mentor gave an order to have himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">put in touch with the inventors of the interplanetary machine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Over a private radio hook-up, he spoke for an hour or so to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two men whose brains had conceived the stupendous work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shortly thereafter, the two were in the air 011 their way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Havana where they were to confer with the Mentor upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible construction of the flyer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime the Mentor had brought together a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen renowned engineers to study the diagrams. And after</seg><seg type="columnLine">many hours spent in a study of the plans they admitted that such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a machine was theoretically feasible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flying, as the Japanese did, at one hundred and fifty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">per hour, it would take them a little over sixty hours to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">Havana. They carried food and drink with them but de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended at way stations to rest and refresh themselves. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">childhood the winged people were taught endurance in flight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a youth did not come to manhood until he had made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single sustained journey of at least three thousand miles. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles of the back and wing-cases were carefully developed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that their owners would not become knotty and muscle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound nor give out under the long strain of enforced flights.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the beginning the winged men might have perfected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying-machines along with their wings, but their leaders had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been wise in realizing that the wings would deteriorate if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines were to be depended upon, and history has proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and time again that men who placed their dependence upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">artificial mechanisms were apt to bccome physically decadent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The winged people of Earth could never be called that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON arriving in Havana, the two Japanese, San Tu Ackwa</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Yoto Murca, went to one of the city's beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotels where they took a few hours of rest before presenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves to the Mentor. Unselfishly the two scientists had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given themselves for many, years to the perfection of a machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">designed to release their fellow-men from the gravitational</seg><seg type="columnLine">shackles of Earth and allow them to soar into the great void,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to extend their conquest of space still more. They had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought for monetary reward, for gold as a means of barter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wealth had gone out of existence. Instead, their names</seg><seg type="columnLine">988</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would go down in history, as benefactors of the race--men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had given the world a boon that was invaluable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With them they had brought the model of their invention</seg><seg type="columnLine">and set about to demonstrate it to the Mentor and the engi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neers be had gathered about him. The model was a perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere made of the light and durable dialutnim. Set as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girdle around it was a series of round mirrors, concave and</seg><seg type="columnLine">convex. In the bottom of the sphere was the manhole for</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance, and from its top ran a vertical strip of quartz crystal</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would serve as windows for the interplanetary travelers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By unscrewing bolts San Tu Ackwa exposed the inside of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe. Here was a large wheel that almost entirely filled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere, but did not touch the sides of the globe. The wheel</seg><seg type="columnLine">was suspended upon a hollow shaft that ran across between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two supporting walls of the sphere, and around its hub was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of crystal openings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> San first explained the motive power of the flyer. He pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out that within the hub of the strange wheel lay the motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanisms. For centuries now the Earthlings had been using</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solar power machine in place of the old electric, fuel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">water driven machines of the ancients. All power, as one</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows, is derived from the solar rays that come across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ninety-three million miles of space between Earth and the sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ancients had had to depend upon wood, coal, oil and elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricity to gather this force, but it had remained for the 30th</seg><seg type="columnLine">century man to take that power directly from the sun itself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was done by the heliogenerators, great mirrors that con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated the heat-rays. Formerly man had to resort to steam</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines, to utilize the heat to derive their power. But with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discovery of great deposits of radio-active ores in various</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of the world, the sun's energy was taken up and concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated on the radium without the need of engines and by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">release of energy a powerful rocket effect was obtained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Demonstration</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was by this method that the Japanese had planned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">propel their flyer. The girdle of mirrors would receive the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's rays, and send it to the rotor housing within the sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the radium was located. The convex mirrors were pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided to reverse this power, so that it would act as a brake for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine, tossing off the heat generated by the concave mir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rors, and by this intricate method of "cooling" bring the sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a halt.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now by setting the sphere in the sunlight that poured through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window, San Tu Ackwa, after switching on the rotor</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors within, allowed them to generate power. A cable</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened to a small box with a keyboard on its surface showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much power the motors were generating. When the dial</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed a sufficient amount he touched one of the keys and</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled the movements of the sphere. It rose and moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the room, circled their heads, went out the window to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the length of its cord, then returned to the table top and</seg><seg type="columnLine">alighted without a jar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that demonstration completed the inventor now pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cedcd to point out the features of the wheel that were puzzling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mentor and his engineers. Opening one section of the rim</seg><seg type="columnLine">he showed the living quarters for the crew and interplanetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers. Series of spiral stairways joined the rim of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel to the hub with its machineries and engines. The spokes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wheel that held the rim in place were hollow shafts</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereby the passengers could fly to the hub. These shafts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were also to carry the ventilation pipes as well as the water to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•	To better understand the amount of "he*!" radiated by tbe ran it mnst</seg><seg type="columnLine">tint be known that the rate at whicb radiant energy of all wavelengths is</seg><seg type="columnLine">received by the Earth from tbe Sun at the outer surface of our atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the sun it at its mean distance, is, In terms of mechanical work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">1.51 horse power per square yard. From this it can be seen that with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large number of great mirrors an immense concentration of energy could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be obtained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the living quarters. In fact nothing seemed to have been for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten for the comfort of the passengers, the heating and tbe</seg><seg type="columnLine">refrigerating, the lighting, the sanitation measures, the radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Visual apparatus. And every living-room, bed-room, dining-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and bathroom, as well as several kitchens, was as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped in miniature as it would be in life-size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE feature that was strangely striking, however, was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the living quarters were upon the rim of the wheel, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceilings being toward the hub of the machine. Yoto Murca</seg><seg type="columnLine">here took up the explanation. He demonstrated that inasmuch</seg><seg type="columnLine">as in space there is no gravity, and gravity can be replaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">only by some other force, they proposed to utilize centrifugal</seg><seg type="columnLine">force for this purpose. To understand centrifugal force better</seg><seg type="columnLine">it must be understood that whereas gravity operates toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of mass centrifugal force operates away from the center.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore, in the quarters set in &lt;he rim of the wheel which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to produce centrifugal force by rotating around the hub,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that which is "up" means toward the axis, while "down'' is</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward from the center, the axis of rotation. It was calcu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated that if the wheel made one revolution in about 8 seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its diameter of 100 feet, a man would be pressed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor with the same force as he would be pressed normally to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface of the Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR hours the Mentor and the scientists discussed the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine. A few minor adjustments were suggested here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, but on the whole it was agreed that the space-flyer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical, and 'he Mentor gave the inventors the assurance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a trial ship would be constructed under their supervision</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the far end of the island of Cuba, where the great experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental laboratories were located in which all the newest inven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions were built and given trial. The following day the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japanese left with a letter to the governor of the laboratories</seg><seg type="columnLine">instructing him to place men and materials at their disposal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would take many months to build the space-flyer, since casts</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to be built for its many intricate parts. And it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take even longer to completely lit it out as the Mentor</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed. But his eyes were shining brightly as he bid San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tu Ackwa and Yoto Murca good day. He was happy in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">realization that the Earthlings were to master another great</seg><seg type="columnLine">field of science. However, no announcement would be given</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the world until the space-flyer had proved itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Mentor's Decision</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN his chambers now sat the Mentor alone. He was weary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the days that had passed since the conference he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been working, accepting and rejecting new plans for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">welfare of his people, and only now did he find himself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few hours of leisure. But there was no rest for him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too much troubled with the momentous question at hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be able to seek recreation. What was the world to do about</seg><seg type="columnLine">its women? True, there were something like forty millions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of young immature females in the world, thousands of whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">were daily reaching the age where they would take upon them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves the duties of wifehood, only to succumb as their mothers</seg><seg type="columnLine">had in that terrible hour. With each generation the problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew, for nothing seemed possible to save the women. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was the world to do when man should at last find him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self without a single woman in his midst? True, the life span</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the individual had been greatly lengthened by science. Thi</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy years of the ancients had been prolonged to two hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred. but in that alone was no solution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mentor slowly turned to President Chang's suggestion</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerning a raid upon another world for women. Astronomers</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that at least two of the planets sustained life, namely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus and Mars, and a number of the satellites of both Jupiter</seg><seg type="columnLine">WOMEN WITH WINGS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">989</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and Saturn were also known to be congenial to human liCc.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And now with the invention of the space-flyer such a raid</seg><seg type="columnLine">could eventually be made. But what if life upon these planets</seg><seg type="columnLine">was different from our own ? Perhaps Nature had not repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself and the beings of these other worlds were of a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">species. And even if human life dwelt upon these worlds, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentor was still averse to engaging in wholesale kidnapping.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To rob another world of its female population was to leave it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same predicament as the Earth was now in. And how</seg><seg type="columnLine">could the Earth's people, whose only religion was Brotherhood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">willingly cause such a condition upon a sister planet? No, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentor decided, mankind would not consent to despoil others</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an effort to save itself. Other measures must be used.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wearily he pushed the button that would bring a clerk to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fifteen minutes later, two of the most renowned members of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the medical profession stood before him. These men had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from the Medical Congress that had met to take up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">studies of a Dr. Moore with regard to changing the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of bringing children into the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> WHAT is the decision of the Congress?" asked the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mentor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir, to do what he proposes will be a momentous step for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to take," answered one of the doctors. "Nature can not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be changed in a day. and the time required to make the altera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions Moore expects will be too long, for by that time thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands of our women must be sacrificed I For the sake of</seg><seg type="columnLine">womanhood itself the Congress agrees that such a project</seg><seg type="columnLine">should not be considered. It is too late for us to proceed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a course, although there is no doubt about its feasibility I"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Horace Wilson sighed as he finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mentor nodded his head sadly. "And yet, doctor, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing has to be done, as you well know. Is it possible for you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to 'de-wing' our people as Mentor once winged us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wilson nodded slowly, almost unwillingly. "It can be done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir! Acting on your suggestion of several months previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have had a number of my assistants experimenting on such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution. They only await your commands to manufacture the</seg><seg type="columnLine">serums in balk I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is not the solution that we want," sighed the Mentor, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know your department has done everything possible to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lives of our women. Howard Mentor, of course, never</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed of an unknown disease arising, when he set about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give us wings. Of course, we realize it will take generations</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us to undo what he has done, but I wish you God's aid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Else we die!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here Doctor Herbert Morris, the second scientist, spoke. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe, Mentor, that it is wrong for us to turn to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">means . . . yet You know that for many years we have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">working upon the possibility of producing our young through</seg><seg type="columnLine">inedianical agencies. Up to this time it is true we've had little</seg><seg type="columnLine">success, but now I am beginning to sec a glimmering of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">We have been working along the wrong lines, but at last re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sults arc beginning to show. If you will only consent to wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">one more year I am certain that we can produce all the winged</seg><seg type="columnLine">children required I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YEAR is a long time, doctor, and our women die daily."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I know that, sir, but if you will but give us that</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of time I am positive we can save the rest as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring into being as many females as are needed to offset the</seg><seg type="columnLine">present deficit. Of course when that is accomplished, it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean that the duties of childbearing must afterward be left</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly to our machines, but in doing so we shall stabilize the-</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of men and women, and man will not be deprived of</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman's companionship I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''If we could be sure of success, doctor, I would gladly give</seg><seg type="columnLine">my permission to continue your experiments before Dr. Wilson</seg><seg type="columnLine">commences his task of removing the wings from our future</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">race. The loss of our women is appalling!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morris nodded. He knew that only yesterday there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed away the Mentor's own beautiful mate. The nations</seg><seg type="columnLine">were grieving with their kindly leader.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was then that Wilson spoke. "Sir," said he, "I think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my colleague is right It were best that he be given that</seg><seg type="columnLine">single year to accomplish his purpose. I have been in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratories and have seen the great progress he is making.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the meantime I would suggest that all women be sterilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">temporarily 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that the Mentor's dark eyes brightened. "Well thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor. Why has no one thought of such a respite sooner?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Better we have no children, than to allow the women to die!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Morris shall have his year, and before night the word</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be sent around the World I" He smiled and held out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hSt»d to Morris. "To your success, sir!" Then he was shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hands with Doctor Wilson. That afternoon word went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that child-bearing was to be forbidden for a year's term.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Strange Visitor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was a week later that the Mentor was startled by a mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage that came to him from the Lick Astronomical Observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory upon the Pacific Coast. When its significance dawned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him he immediately took to the air with but a single attend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant, his eldest son, Alvin Page. The world was surprised to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear of his sudden departure, for it was seldom that the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruler ever left the seat of government. For days now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthlings had been in a ferment. The edict forbidding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conception of young-that had followed the meeting of the ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrestrial leaders had left the populace restless and puzzled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since they had known that the condition of the womanhood</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world was serious, it was natural that they should see</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this unprecedented journey of the Mentor something con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerning the matter at hand. However, the message requesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mentor's presence at Lick had had nothing to do with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs of the globe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Its content was of far different purport The observatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Mount Hamilton was by far the largest of its kind in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world, the lenses of the telescope measuring fifty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">across! And what the astronomers had sighted in them had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been so strangely arresting that they had sent immediately for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet ruler. For what had been seen was indubitably a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man-made machine leaving the cloud-shrouded face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet Venus 1 And it was headed for Earth I</seg><seg type="columnLine">For three hours they had watched it before the planet ruler</seg><seg type="columnLine">was appraised of the strange fact, though often it disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their lenses, for it showed nothing more tlian a pencil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">streak of light out in the void. It was impossible to determine</seg><seg type="columnLine">its shape, but there was no doubt that it was propelled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentient beings. It was only by an accident, however, that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had •been discovered at all by a student who had for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time turned his eyes upon that distant planet. When the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape had swum into his vision he had called for a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned astronomer. Photographs had instantly been taken and</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed while others still peered at the moving flash of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">that appeared to move slowly on its course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VENUS with her all-enfolding shrouds has always been</seg><seg type="columnLine">an enigma to Earth. Much has been written about her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but little is known. For although man with his great telescopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been enabled to read the faces of the other planets dearly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus had continued to hide her secrets. Once or twice through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the centuries a rift had been reported in the Vcnusian clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one astronomer had thought that he glimpsed a city upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet's surface, but he could never be certain. They did</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, however, that the thick, vapory atmosphere differed but</seg><seg type="columnLine">little from that of Earth, the clouds themselves acting as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">990</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shield against the intense heat the sun radiated upon it. Mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cury without this shield was an inferno upon its one surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">always turned to the sun, while upon the opposite face that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay forever away from the great star the temperature dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">at times to absolute zero. Mars, on the other hand, was known</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be inhabited, for the telescopic photographs marked a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of great structures and more than one queer craft had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen moving through the dusty atmosphere of that world. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the satellite moon of the Earth, on the shores of the long dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas, the ruins of wondrous cities had been discovered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bespoke a race of beings whose needs had been identical with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the Earthlings. Why then should not the beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet Venus that lay upon the Earth horizon have life thereon?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">All day and night the Mentor and his son had flown across</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea and lowlands, plateaux and mountains, and near dawn they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came within sight of the towering dome of the observatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Mount Hamilton. Arriving on the broad roof just below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dome, they were met by a group of astronomers who with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out words led them directly to the telescope. In a few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were staring at the long bright ship that now, as it neared</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth, could be recognized clearly as &lt;3f cylindrical shape. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange feature of the flyer lay in the fact that the sun's rays,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that should have struck it obliquely as it hurtled on its way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not being reflected but appeared instead to pass directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it, as though the machine were half transparent I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Down to Earth 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ITHOUT a doubt," observed Professor D'Arcy, gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernor of the observatory, "the Venusians are bent upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">paying us a call, but whether it is to be a friendly visit or one</seg><seg type="columnLine">for purposes of attack we have no way of telling. It is evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent, however, that they are far more advanced than we of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth, since they have succeeded in conquering the void. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been trying to get in touch with them by means of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio, but have so far failed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ah, but you are wrong, Professor, in believing that Venus</seg><seg type="columnLine">is superior to us in intellect," the Mentor remonstrated, "just</seg><seg type="columnLine">because they have beaten us in the secret of interplanetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel. True, they are the first to have sent out their ships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not many months will elapse before an Earthly ship also</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be launched into space!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You mean it is possible?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Quickly the Mentor told of the invention of the Japanese</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of the certainty that it would succeed. "Heretofore, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists have failed because of their misconceptions of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">constitutes a space-flying machine, but though I have not an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced the fact to the world, I am certain that the Japanese</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere will do all that its inventors claim. In fact, I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">never been more certain of an untried experiment as I am of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. I will not hesitate to go up in it on the initial trip!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"The principles propounded are sound, sir. Pray that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be all that you expect, for not only will it widen the horizon</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Earthling, but perhaps some day our people will journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">on across the great Outer Void to other Universes and Gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">axies! And what's more, our scientists will no longer need</seg><seg type="columnLine">to depend upon faulty telescopes to examine the world that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lies beyond."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">For many hours the watchers never left the telescopes as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they studied the progress of the Venusian vessel. After care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful computation it was estimated that the ship's speed was</seg><seg type="columnLine">approximately 200 miles per second, and as Venus was then</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling toward her inferior conjunction and was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">like 26,000,000 miles distant from Earth, it would take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-flyer at least thirty-five hours to reach Earth. Already</seg><seg type="columnLine">for more than thirty hours the scientists had watched her on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her course. Another four hours and she would arrive 1 When</seg><seg type="columnLine">or where the flyer would land upon Earth they had no way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next few hours were feverish ones for the astrono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mers, for other observers had seen the Venusian machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were in communication with one another. Then the broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casting stations were sending the news in relays around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world and efforts were made to photograph it in the Tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Visual screens. The observatories had announced that the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gradually slowing down. At ten o'clock, Pacific time, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was seen to enter the atmosphere, traveling at about three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred miles an hour'. Slowly it encircled the globe, drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping lower and lower until it could be seen by the naked eye.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twice more it swung around the globe before it dropped to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">isolated spot along the Florida coast not many miles south</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the old resort city of Miami. Immediately the Mentor dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patched an order that none should approach the stranger within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a radius of two thousand feet, until it could be discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether the Venusians came as friends or foes. With D'Arcy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his son and a number of the scientists, the Mentor left Lick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and headed for the Eastern seaboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They flew at top speed, for the Mentor was greatly worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">about this strange circumstance. In his heart he feared that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arrival of the interplanetary machine boded no good for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his world. And the Earthlings were unprepared for an attack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since their development was along unwarlike lines. The Mentor</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not speak of his fears to his companions as they winged</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way across the 3000 miles to the Eastern coast Flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">at 150 to 175 miles per hour they could not hope to reach Florida</seg><seg type="columnLine">in less than nineteen or twenty hours. It was a long trip to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take, flying so swiftly, and especially for the two members of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the party who had already flown more than that distance not</seg><seg type="columnLine">many hours before. Moreover, they were encountering head</seg><seg type="columnLine">winds, and time was always lost in crossing the mighty moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain ranges of the west</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Disappeared I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN the Venusian ship settled upon the sands, on an</seg><seg type="columnLine">island that lay between the ocean and Biscaync Bay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a small group of flying men there to witness it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were six guards whose dutyxit was to keep the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">beacon light on the beach trimmed to guide night flyers out</seg><seg type="columnLine">at sea, and also to patrol that part of the shores and sky in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the event that a flyer who had ovci taxed himself could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">come down without aid. They had been listening intently to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broadcast from the observatories, and had kept a lookout</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the space-flyer. It was they who told the world of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">descent. And no sooner had they submitted their report than</seg><seg type="columnLine">they deserted their posts, flying swiftly the mile and a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">to where they had seen the stranger drop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They were greatly astounded by its size, for it was fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">two thousand feet in length. It lay on the golden sands with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a sign of movement, its black polished body a blot of shadow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In wonder they stared down upon it, not knowing what course</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take. Had they waited longer at their station they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have received the Mentor's command not to draw near, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, after a moment's parley, they drew closer, alighting upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sands. They stalked about the black cylinder at a safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance and were surprised at not finding a visible entrance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for although its black exterior appeared to be of glass, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so thick that the figures within could be seen only as through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a haze. So engrossed was one fellow by this phenomenon, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached the smooth wall and sought to see through it by</seg><seg type="columnLine">shading his eyes with his hands. The others saw him suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn and run, but he had not taken more than a dozen steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he had thrown up his arms and dropped to the sands</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifeless 1 Immediately the others took to wing, but not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped the invisible attack, for one by one they all dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground. The Venusians had spoken 1 It was War 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In twenty minutes or so a number of the winged people from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miami had arrived. They congratulated themselves that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were first upon the scene, for the sands surrounding the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">black cylinder with its needle-sharp nose were empty of life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WOMEN WITH WINGS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">991</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAFING at the command of the Mentor not to approach</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer than the two thousand feet, the dozen or so men</seg><seg type="columnLine">llcw about trying to discover what they could of the intruder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still, for all its quietness, there was a feeling among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winged people that they were being stared at, and a malevolent</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit seemed to pervade the very air about the ship. More</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more people were arriving on the scene and officials ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared, bringing men to police the circle, so that none would</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach the Venusian ship at close hand. Occasionally a fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low or two would fly too near and be severely reprimanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the government officials among them. Had they known of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "shooting" and subsequent disappearance of the Beacon</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards there might have been demonstrations of violence from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowds, but there was no sign of the six bodies. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowds could only stare and gape at the dark shape with im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience. Why did it show no life? Why did not the travelers</seg><seg type="columnLine">show themselves? What did they fear? Many opinions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed as to what should be done. Some believed that a party</seg><seg type="columnLine">should descend to the sands and signal to the Venusians. Others</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that attempts should be made to break into it. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing should be done! But they knew they were waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet ruler to arrive. Still why did not the Venusians</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves act? Did they really fear violence from the milling</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Word was next received that President Trent of North</seg><seg type="columnLine">America was on his way with a party of officials from Wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington, and shortly after that report came a corps of radiomen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the broadcasting systems to set up apparatus to inform</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world of what happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowds in the sky were continually increasing as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying people came from miles around. The difficulty of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officials to keep them in place grew. The sand dunes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cay were becoming literally covered by the people, who alighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few minutes before taking to the air again. The excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that prevailed grew until the air was loud with the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the thousands of voices and the whirr of the powerful wings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, as the radio-corps had their apparatus ready, they com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced broadcasting, estimating that over fifteen thousand were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered round about. The Tele-Visual shortly thereafter took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene and the world saw the long cylinder crouching on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands like a half-sleeping monster. Half the world had aroused</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself from sleep to see that strange picture, and listened avidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the words of the announcer as he conjectured about the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were in the ship, who had crossed 26,000,000 miles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, and yet seemed fearful of facing the crowds of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">sister planet Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, with a suddenness that was inexplicable, the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased speaking and the scene was blotted simultaneously from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Visual screens all over the world. The broadcasting sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions were besieged with queries demanding to know what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong. Station NN2 in Miami, which had been receiving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reports from the beach, frantically attempted to discover the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause for the cessation of the program, and announced that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trouble came not from them but from the apparatus on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cay. Flyers were being dispatched immediately from Miami</seg><seg type="columnLine">to discover what had occurred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Shadows in the Night</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A LMOST an hour passed before the world received news</seg><seg type="columnLine">r\ again. It came from a reporter at Miami who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first to. reach the interplanetary ship and return. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">averred that although he had found the space-flyer in its place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly as it had been seen through the Visual screens, not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single soul of the fifteen thousand spectators who had gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">there could be found I It was as though they had disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely from the face of the Earth! An examination of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the radio-lay-out proved that it was completely dead, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power-machines of the beacon station as well!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Consternation reigned upon the globe 1 Cries were coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">in from all sides that an attack be made upon the visitor. Fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept into many hearts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mentor and his party flew faster and President Trent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his retinue also rushed to the scene. Several thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">other men hurried there too, but dared not approach within a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile of the now evidently sinister cylinder, but soared high</seg><seg type="columnLine">above. From Jacksonville a contingent of men put out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old arsenal with bundles of electro-thunderbolts, the ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire-arm that had not been used since the Third War, but which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been preserved merely as relics. These weapons were small</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylindrical tubes about six inches in length and each contained</seg><seg type="columnLine">six electric charges that sent a powerful charge of electricity</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand feet. It was these thunderbolts that the Mentorites</seg><seg type="columnLine">had used in 1945 to defeat the combined armies of the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was to be doubted that these simple little weapons could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any use against the science of the Venusians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The question was now: What had happened to those fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands? Had the Venusians murdered them and carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">them thence into their ship? Or had they merely used a weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">that completely disintegrated flesh and bone? If the latter was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case, why should the Venusians seek to murder so wantonly?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surely they did not believe that in that way they could hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">to conquer the globe? Facts pointed rather to their having</seg><seg type="columnLine">used either a gas or an invisible ray that paralyzed the muscles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after which it had been a simple matter for them to carry their</seg><seg type="columnLine">captives into their ship. That the motors of the radio and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beacon station had been paralyzed also pointed to such a pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility. And fifteen thousand men could easily have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">stored away in that great hulk. But why? What was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive behind the act?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AN hour before sundown the American President and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">. party arrived on the scene, but he did not approach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-machine. He ordered the electro-thunderbolts distributed</seg><seg type="columnLine">among all those gathered, with directions to shoot down any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the invaders who might make any signs of violence. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he also realized the ineffectualness of those ancient arms against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black bulk of the cylinder. Then from Tampa arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen flyers carrying a number of heavy explosive bombs</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had pilfered from the museum in their city. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought to drop the explosives upon the Venusian ship, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the officials forbade it. They were not sure that their brethren</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not imprisoned in the ship, and to demolish it would mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">the murdering of thousands of their own people. It was agreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a decision was a matter for the Mentor, and they must</seg><seg type="columnLine">await his arrival.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Night was descending, and with its coming bonfires were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted upon the dunes, as the Earthlings continued their watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stranger in their midst. Experiment proved that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power station of the Beacon was again in working order, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great beam was turned upon the huge, black, silent mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the sands. Some of the watchers decided to return to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">homes, but a thousand or so stayed to guard the ship during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night, although they were not certain as to what their</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchfulness amounted to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All went well until a little after midnight, when suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">without warning the beacon light snapped off! Nor did a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul move upon the dunes. One or two men who had been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air dropped to the ground and lay where they had fallen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not far from the black hulk. All were as quiet as the gravel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was then that a curious sight could have been seen. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Venusian ship dark shadows crept forth. There were per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps a hundred of these shadows, and it was toward the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they moved. One of their number leaned forward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted a bit of the salty brine to its lips, then gathered with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows in conference. Others tasted the water, then in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerted rush they took to the air, arose with a little difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred yards, hovered a minute or so, and then made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunge into the darkened waters. What a pity the moon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">992</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not shining I Only the presence of the minute phosphorescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">particles that are present in great numbers in Floridian waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">traced their course where they hit the water and their passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they moved below the surface. Then they were rising again</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their wings, to plunge oncc more into the depths. For an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour or so this performance continued, the creatures remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the water as loRg as fifteen minutes at a time. Then at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last they rose into the air and turned to the land and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine. Half an hour later, the long length of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel climbed skyward with a low moaning hum. It showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no light as it climbed, and then it was gone into the darkness 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">What Did It Mean?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN the Mentor and his company wearily dropped upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sands close to the spot where the Venusian craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lain they were shocked to find nothing but the long de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression in the sand to show where it had rested 1 And not</seg><seg type="columnLine">far away was the mute witness to the scene that had passed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the radio outfit. Yet on either side for a mile in both direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions lay sprawled in sleep a great number of the Earthlings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The blackened ashes of what had been bonfires occasionally</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent up a curl of smoke, while not five hundred yards from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the depression where the strange ship had lain was the figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man curled with one wing under him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The new arrivals eyed one another, seeking an explanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">in each other's faces. But none of them had any to offer. Alvin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Page approached the figure on the sand and shook it With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wide yawn the fellow awakened, and appeared astonished that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been sleeping. Then he saw the Mentor's son, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked about in wonder. He saw the depression and realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Venusian ship was gone. Sheepishly he got to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found that his one wing was crippled, and as he approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mentor he was limping painfully. Trying to recollect what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had befallen him he told simply all that he could remember . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">the splash of the light beam on the long machine, the bivouac</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his fellows, the lighting of the fires and the preparations for</seg><seg type="columnLine">night He recalled that he had Climbed high into the sky for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a last look at the cylinder before settling for the night. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feeling of drowsiness had come over him, the terrible sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation of dropping and an inability to save himself. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened only by Alvin's touch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The others listened in silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">D'Arcy was first to speak. "They have some damnable con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trivance that paralyzes anything within its range. Strange that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they should have captured the first fifteen thousand and leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">another thousand or so sleeping. No doubt they were filled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">capacity on the first haul 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Page went to arouse President Trent whom the man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crippled wing had remembered seeing on the left hand side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the clearing. One of the scientists of the Mentor's party</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined the radio and found that it responded to his touch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the planet ruler's direction the new discovery was broadcast</seg><seg type="columnLine">while all observatories were directed to search the skies for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interplanetary machine. The Mentor feared that it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone to another more secluded spot on the globe, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">to continue its damage, but an hour later reports came that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venusian machine had been discovered out in the void headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Venus!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PRESIDENT TRENT joined the Mentor. He was down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast over the fact that he had been found napping. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">also told a story of a wave of drowsiness that had come over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He was crestfallen that the Venusians had slipped away</seg><seg type="columnLine">without any attempt on the part of the Americans to punish</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. He was consoled by the thought that nothing could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been done, anyway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">For many minutes the men stood on the sands conjecturing</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to what this visit of the people from their sister planet had</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant. Why had they come at all? What was their purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">in capturing thousands of our people? For now it was re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">garded as certain that the ship had purposely borne away fii-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen thousand captives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can it mean," queried Trent, "that they are faced with</seg><seg type="columnLine">starvation ... or that they were in need of slaves ... ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">D'Arcy shook his head. "People who are advanced in science</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Venusians appear to be would be able, to provide them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves with synthetic food, and slaves arc not necessary when</seg><seg type="columnLine">people have a working knowledge of mechanics!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What is your opinion, then?" asked the Mentor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Perhaps they are faced with the same problem as we . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dying of our women!" replied D'Arcy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yet the party was mostly men. I doubt there were a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred women in the lot," said Trent</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Professor nodded.

And we need women I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Coming of The Mentor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Mentor's face lighted up. "Ah, you are right, Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor, but we must hurry. As it stands now, it will take</seg><seg type="columnLine">many months to finish the machine. And to war upon Venus</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will need more than one machine! That will delay us still</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer, for I will not order the construction of more flyers</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the first proves its worth! It will take many months</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we go to Venus to reclaim our own 1" He sighed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to join the others, but as he did so he reeled and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have fallen had not D'Arcy caught his arm. He saw then how</seg><seg type="columnLine">grey and weary all were who had flown from Lick, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wan smile he noted that they needed sleep. President Trent</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to the Beacon station and advised that they retire there</seg><seg type="columnLine">for several hours. In the meantime he would attend to such</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs as required the planet ruler's attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was necessary for the Mentor and his son to be supported</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they made their way to the haven. There they found a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen or so recumbent forms stretched in different positions just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they had been when the light of the beam had been ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguished by the Venusians. No one had thought to arouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">them sooner. They were astonished to learn what had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened. They helped to make the Mentor and his party com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable in the dormitory on the second level of the building.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But before dropping to sleep, the Mentor directed that the corps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men at work upon the interplanetary machine be doubled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then in a moment he was asleep. A few hours of sleep suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficed him, however, and again he took to the air, this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed for Cuba.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The following day Professor D'Arcy's views concerning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venusian expedition were broadcast, together with the news</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Earthlings would shortly proceed to Venus to aid</seg><seg type="columnLine">their kidnapped brethren. The thought that the fifteen thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand were alive heartened all and in the days that followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came thousands of applications from over all the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking permission to take part in the expedition to Venus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The laboratories reported that they needed at least three more</seg><seg type="columnLine">months before the space-flyer could be finished, although work</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being rushed day and night</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OTHER preparations were also being made, and from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long dosed files of formulas and blueprints of past inven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">WOMEN WITH WINOS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">993</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, weapons of warfare were being carefully studied by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of engineers who were to decide what means would</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove most effective against the vandals of Venus. So long</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the planet been at peace that little thought had been given</seg><seg type="columnLine">to defensive or offensive armament. With her thunderbolts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her aero-electrovoid machines which had created a vacuum</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the atmosphere and thus drawn down the planes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy, America had centuries before conquered the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But these things had been so long forgotten that the Mentor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was surprised to learn that so many infernal weapons had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceived by man, that such blood-thirsty strains had existed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in previous generations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day came when the first interplanetary flyer was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted and the world rejoiced. With its launching, the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">was duly christened The Mentor. San Tu Ackwa and Yoto</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murca, the inventors, were to command the ship, and at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty mechanical engineers, astronomers and scientists were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accompany it upon its maiden trip. Wistfully the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruler watched The Mentor as it took to the air after its great</seg><seg type="columnLine">helio-generators had absorbed great quantities of the sun's rays.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he had told D'Arcy at the Lick Observatory, he had intended</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a passenger 011 the initial trip of the machine, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peoples of the world had cried out against the risking of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life in the undertaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had to be content instead with watching its progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the Visual screens as The Mentor emerged from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth's blanket into the darkness of the void. The whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">world watched its progress with bated breaths. Its first stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the Moon, where it was seen to land, upon the wide plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Sea of Serenity. The travelers made no attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">disembark upon that desolate world, since they were unpre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared to cope with its conditions. From the plain it moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastward, viewing the awful grandeur of that dead world. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the journey The Mentor attempted to keep in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munication with Earth, but it was almost impossible. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be "dead spots" in the void which refused to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">the radio waves. But occasionally word came through. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Moon they headed back toward Earth, encircled her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then slowly returned to the flyer's billet The whole trip had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken sixteen hours! It took a little less than eight hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make the journey to the Moon, traveling at a rate of 30,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles an hour. It was estimated that on a longer journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">where there was time to accelerate the machine more quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Mentor could travel at 50 miles per second or 180,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ready!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE scientists were most enthusiastic about The Mentor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and barring a few supplementary adjustments they advised</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was ready for the long journey to Venus. Immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon their report an order was given for eleven more astral-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nautic flyers to be constructed. The laboratories promised to</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete them in four months' time. In the meantime it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the duty of The Mentor to prepare crews for the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships under construction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the same time the laboratories were also at work upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the construction of the several weapons the engineers had recom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mended for use upon the flyers. Of all the inventions filed</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, only two were to be given trial. The first was a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly ray called 22A, a ray whose color was purplish-red</seg><seg type="columnLine">and which completely disintegrated all matter regardless of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its composition. The second was Explosive 67 whose power</seg><seg type="columnLine">was breath-taking. Six pounds of it were powerful enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">demolish a whole mountain. There was still a third weapon--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one which the Mentor trusted would be sufficient to subdue</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Venusians without having recourse to the first two more</seg><seg type="columnLine">destructive weapons. This was a new ray discovered by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer a month before. In trying to learn what power the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venusians had used to paralyze their captives, as well as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">power-motors, he had accidently found a device he called the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Super-Resonator that could destroy any machinery by causing</seg><seg type="columnLine">its molecules to be speeded up to such a degree that the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">burnt into a thousand fragments. The ray from the Resonator</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a blue beam; it had a spread of twenty feet, and a range</seg><seg type="columnLine">of more than five miles. The Mentor recommended that that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray be used in preference to the first two exterminators, unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was to be found that the Venusians were bent upon more</seg><seg type="columnLine">destructive measures when their planet was invaded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*****</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seven months after the Venusian descent, the eleven new</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-flyers were ready for action. They were each given a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trial trip in which they proved themselves equal to any strain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meanwhile twelve thousand flying men had been mobilized.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Care had been taken in selecting them from the thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">applicants as well as the twelve hundred men who were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make up the crews. Of officers there were one hundred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">each ship with their commander. The Mentor, as flag-ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried Commander-in-Chief Ware, who was to take over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of the expedition. San Tu Ackwa and Yoto Murca</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to accompany him in the role of technical directors. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of astronomers with Professor Anton D'Arcy at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">head were ordered to accompany the flyers. By using a par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly short wavelength it was learned that radio communi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation between the twelve ships could be carried on in space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally the day came for the embarkation of the expedition</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Venus. Again the Mentor admonished Ware to do no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more damage to the Venusian? than was necessary for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovery of the fifteen thousand abducted Earthlings. If pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, an attempt was to be made to establish some peaceable</seg><seg type="columnLine">communication with the Venusians I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Race Through Space</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH the departure of the expedition, the Tele-Visual</seg><seg type="columnLine">screens broadcast the stirring scene from Lick as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve ships in a V-shapcd formation set off into</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. Inasmuch as the two planets had been steadily moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart, Venus now lay 120,000,000 miles from Earth. Journey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the rate of 180,000 miles per hour it would take them</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly 50 days to reach the planet in its present position. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet would have moved further from the earth in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meantime and the whole journey would take 60 days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Days, long endless days of silence passed after the departure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ships and their brave crews. Through the great tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scopes the progress of the ships was watched with anxious eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the news radioed to the millions of the Earth's people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fifty days had passed, when one day the weary observers</seg><seg type="columnLine">at their telescopes saw six ships emerge from the Venusian</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere and set their course in the direction of the oncoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth craft 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was it a challenge? Was there to be a battle in space? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's people held their breath during the following days as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parties drew swiftly closer. Then they saw that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venusian vessels had veered suddenly, as though unaware of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oncoming spheres. There was what looked like panicky</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement among them as they suddenly dashed out in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">directions. They were then seen to come together again beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earthly ships, sweep around them and head for home again!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime, aboard The Mentor, Commander-in-Chief Thomas</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ware was also in a quandary. Through the televisual screens</seg><seg type="columnLine">that photographed all that went on outside the globes, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the quiet approach of the enemy. His orders for</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparation for battle rang out, and drawing themselves more</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely for action, the Earthlings had waited. Then in surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw with what shock the Venusians had met them, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they lost their formation, separated, then gathered together again</seg><seg type="columnLine">994</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran for home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was D'Arcy who stated a decisive opinion of the meaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that maneuver. Apparently, unaware that the Earthlings</seg><seg type="columnLine">were preparing for war, thfc Venusians had waited only long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to discover the result of their experiments with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen thousand captives. The results had been good, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had prepared a half dozen flyers to descend upon Earth again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kidnap six times that number! They were utterly routed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on discovering that the Earthlings were on their way to Venus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were hurrying back to their planet to warn their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cohorts! Such was D'Arcy's theory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  However, the Venusians did not descend to their planet, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be awaiting the arrival of the Earthlings. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were merely keeping themselves a few thousand miles ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the round globes! That their ships were capable of a tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous speed was proved by the easy manner in which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had encircled tbe Earthlings. Now Ware ordered their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed increased to its limit of 250,000 miles per hour. Imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately the Venusians increased their own, determined, no doubt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep their distance!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THIS tvas vastly puzzling to the Earthlings. Was it that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Venusians were awaiting reinforcements, since they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were outnumbered two to one? Why were they content just</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep ahead? Why should they wish their planet torn by</seg><seg type="columnLine">strife, if reinforcements were not forthcoming? Were they</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading the Earthlings into a trap? It could scarcely be more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than strategy on their part I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On, on they continued with the Venusians in full view, bright</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lights marking their position. The void was otherwise in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tensely black with the great shining ball of the sun glaring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so brilliantly on their left as to blind anyone who dared to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gaze directly into it. The mighty corona was plainly visible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and great prominences that shot out thousands upon thousands</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of miles into space. Professor D'Arcy spent most of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">journey viewing that great star through his dark glasses. This</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was a year in which sun-spots were numerous, and through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a telescope of his own devising, he watched a great spot that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lay close to the latitude of six degrees. He estimated it to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be 50,000 miles across, and was vastly put out that he had not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brought some photographic plates with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Earthlings Speak</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO the rear and somewhat to the left of them lay Mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth, now a bluish-white globe that to the voyagers ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to be the most beautiful sight in the great Universe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gradually she had grown smaller and smaller as Venus grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger. On all sides could be seen the stars, some so distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">that even our great sun would have appeared as but a pin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of light to them. The fact that they could be seen at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all attested to their own tremendous size. Out in the void it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed as though a great many more stars could be observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">than from Earth. D'Arcy explained that this was true, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light of many of them did not penetrate Earth's atmosphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Venus was now shining with a clear blue light and in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">two days and a half they would reach her. It was then that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw a meteor hurtling directly in their path! All through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trip meteorites had been seen to drop on all sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-flyers, and more than once they had had to swerve from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their path to avoid them. Yoto Murca was even now studying</seg><seg type="columnLine">a method by which the spheres could be warned of their coming,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since it became a nerve-racking task for the outlooks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep watch for the speeding missiles. Now as the meteor</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared pandemonium reigned for a few minutes in the ships.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as the great mass was seen to pass hundreds of miles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their left all fear was gone and they could only watch it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">awed wonder. It appeared to be heading directly into the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning globe of the sun, and though its head did pass through,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corona it was seen to pass beyond the star.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">AFTER another day had passed Venus lay due ahead, filling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">, the entire prospect before them. And as the Earth ships</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">approached they realized that the Venusian ships had deliber-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ately slowed down and were waiting for them, planning to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">follow them into the great swirling cloud masses that were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hiding the face of the planet. Against this blanket the ships</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could plainly be seen. For hours now the spheres had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slackening their speed so that when they did reach the cloud</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">masses they were not moving at more than five hundred miles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">per hour. Then further braking their speed they were swim-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ming into the perpetual fogs of Venus and their brightest head-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lights were switched on in an effort to cut the mist. Occa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sionally, through the swirls, they could see one or another of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Venusian machines, and it was noticeable that they were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">leading them onward to some specific point of their world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The space-flyers were put in readiness for an attack I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They were now dropping steadily, and when they estimated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that they were 100 miles above the surface they saw a lake</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">appear below, although the Earthlings did not at first recog-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nize the ochraceous yellow substance as liquid. Only the wave-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like motion proved this to be the case. Moving at an altitude</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of about five thousand feet the ship swept along no faster than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one hundred and fifty miles per hour. The Venusian vessels</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were almost wholly visible, for here close to the lake the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clouds had cleared perceptibly. It was then that Commander</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ware ordered his ships prepared for battle. A double V was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">formed with The Mentor in the center. The first two ships of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the line were ordered to let loose the blue beam upon the hind-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">most Venusian. Immediately the ship was seen to waver, to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">race suddenly ahead, then come to a halt before it plunged</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nose first down to the lake below. It plunged into the yellow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flood to bob back to the surface where it rolled and tossed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the waves. The Earthlings had spoken I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Strange Battle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">AS the single ship dropped to the water the other Venusians</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">. went scurrying into the mists. Immediately Ware sent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out the order for four ships to follow and disable them as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">first had been disabled. It was then that a strange whistle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sounded in the radio amplifiers on a longer wavelength than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Earth ships had utilized and a friendly voice was heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Greetings, friends!" cried the voice, in their own tongue!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"On and at them, but call your ships from the clouds! There</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Zoldans have them bested I Keep to sea level."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Who is this speaking?" demanded the operator of The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mentor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Don't bother about that now, but call your ships down, or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a minute it will be too late I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ware, who had been standing close to the amplifier, wisely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">acted upon the order and hastened to recall the ships, realizing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that here was a friend who knew for a certainty what to ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pect. A minute thereafter two of the spheres were seen to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drop from the clouds. Ware directed that they return to for-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mation, but they did not respond 1 Instead they were falling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">straight down to the yellow ocean. They took the plunge not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">far from the floating Venusian, throwing up waves and ipray,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then coming to the surface and rolling over and over!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Sorry, they got your ships," observed the strange voice in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the radio. "However, their range is no greater than a mile</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or two, so if you can reach them at a greater distance you are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">safe. Good luck to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was evident that there were friends down on the planet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">who had managed to construct a radio equal to their own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The two remaining scouts now appeared from the cloud banks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and were being followed by the long cylindrical shapes of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Venusian ships. From the foremost ship appeared the wide</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blue beam that enveloped the leading cylinder, which imme-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">diately took its plunge. Again the others ran into the clouds,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but this time the Earth ships stayed close to the water, waiting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for them to make their appearance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WOMEN WITH WINGS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">995</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down upon the ocean rolled the fallen earth ships, bouncing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in response to the waves. Ware stared at the two disabled</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres, (earful that his men had been killed. But inasmuch</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the spheres were hermetically sealed, he hoped that those</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught within were safe even if temporarily paralyzed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venusian rays. It was then that he saw movement in the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">disabled cylinders riding the waves. A hatch suddenly shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">open and out of it flew one after another of the people of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Others of the ships had seen them and were exclaiming</seg><seg type="columnLine">loudly at the strange forms. They were winged, and at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earthlings believed them to be their own people. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">they realized that the difference lay in their covering, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had first been thought to be a type of clothing, but on closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspection through the binoculars proved to be minute scales</seg><seg type="columnLine">that glistened iridescently in the half-lights that came through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clouds! Head, face, arms and body, as well as the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight wings, were scaled exactly as a fish is scaled!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second ship was also giving up its swarms of strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. For a few minutes the winged beings hovered over their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships; then, as if at the direction of a leader, they flew to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two Earth ships were being bulleted by the waves. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight they had none of the grace of the winged men of Earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor were they so swift. Then a swarm of them reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest sphere and were alighting on it from all sides. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to examine it, and not finding what tjiey wished, a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the creatures dived into the water while others still clung to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side. In wonder the Earthlings above saw the sphere roll</seg><seg type="columnLine">over on its side, until its man-hole appeared! Immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amphibians were at work upon the hatch, seeking to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">its secret!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this had happened in such a short space of time that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men in the ships above had been too stunned to think. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the Venusians, or Zoldans, as the voice over the radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">had named them, made an attempt to slip into their ships the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthlings sprang into action. Ware ordered five of his ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of the remaining ships send their men to attack the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to guard them from attack from above, while he directed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rauders. They were each to carry their electro-thunderbolts, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders were given to stun, not kill, for Ware had come to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden conclusion that the Zoldan warriors were women!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Down to the Water!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON first reaching the atmosphere of Venus, the Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists had taken samples of the air, and discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was equal in atmospheric pressure to that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth, with perhaps a slightly higher degree of oxygen. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the hatches open, the first squadrons of Earthlings came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air and darted to where the Venusians sought entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the disabled sphere. The second sphere had been attacked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same manner, and it was evident that the women would</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon discover the secret of the entrances. No doubt they thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to control the space-flyers and attack the enemy with their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Acting under orders not to kill, the Earthlings dived to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack, loosing their thunderbolts, using half charges. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">winged women saw them coming and half their number rose in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud to meet the attack. They appeared armed with rods a</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot long, which let forth a sharp dart that plowed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh and bone. I}ut their darts did not climb well, and it ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared that the ZoMans were seeking to gain altitude. A dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so did manage to gain the air above the Earthlings, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">darts found a number of victims, sending them falling to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water below. But the Earth thunderbolts spoke and sent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venusians plunging into the ocean, writhing and turning as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now with the battle at its height below, a Venusian ship was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen dropping from the clouds. Before the spheres were aware</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of its proximity, it had taken its toll and another flyer fell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water. Before it could gain cover of the clouds, however, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue beam from The Menlor had caught it and, after careening</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertainly, it too fell, following its victim with a mighty splash.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ware now ordered two ships to scout close to the clouds' surface,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shortly thereafter another Venusian ship fell from the fogs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That meant that there were only two more of the cylinders in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clouds. But though the spheres climbed warily into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds, they were unable to sight them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON the other hand, the two fallen ships were giving up their</seg><seg type="columnLine">crews, who upon discovering that the motors were power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, were hurrying to join their fellows in the hand-to-hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle. More and more of the Earthlings were dispatched, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon the water all around was literally covered by the floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies of the amphibians as well as a great number of the winged</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who had been brought down by their darts. Either the aim</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Zoldan women was not good, or else, like the Earthlings</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were bent only upon disabling the enemy, for few of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">darts had given mortal wounds. They lodged mostly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing muscles or the limbs, bringing the men to the water, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were left to float or swim as best they could. Unlike the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women of Venus, the flying peoples of Earth seldom if ever took</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the water. Hence, after their first dousing in the yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean, the Earthlings were a sorry-looking people. A number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them went down before they could reach one of the floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyers, to which they clung in droves. The winged women, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other hand, who had been stunned by the thunderbolts usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated on the surface. The effect of the charge of electricity</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had received, however, did not so completely stun</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as to let them drown, and after lying in the water for</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen or twenty minutes or so they could be seen reviving, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise again to the attack with their sisters I</seg><seg type="columnLine">So might the battle have gone on indefinitely, but for the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there appeared to be more of the Earthlings than of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zoldans, and the range of the thunderbolts was greater than</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the darts used by the women. There were always free</seg><seg type="columnLine">troops to be flung from the hovering spheres. Now the women</seg><seg type="columnLine">were attempting to make their escape, spreading out in all di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rections, or else diving into the water and swimming until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were out of range of the thunderbolts, not showing themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the water until they believed themselves safe I</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then about five miles from the scene of the battle appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fifth cylinder, which quickly plunged to the water. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere that had brought it down hovered close above it, waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it to disgorge its warriors. The two cruising scouts that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been searching for the sixth cylinder returned to report to</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Mentpr that the remaining ship was not to be found. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">now dispatched their fighting men into the melee below. But all</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight appeared to have left the beaten women, and the Earthlings</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to content themselves with capturing as many of the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures as they could, first stunning them with the thunderbolts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">catching them in the air before they struck the water. Others</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sweeping down to the water in an effort to retrieve their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows, who were still struggling in the water, and to pull them</seg><seg type="columnLine">out without wetting their own wings. Some of the wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in the water had managed to catch one of the amphibians</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forced their captives to support them in the water so they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not drown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Strange Voice</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">F:OFESSOR D'ARCY aboard The Mentor had been watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the whole strange affair through the floor of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lounge rooms. More than once he fiad been convulsed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter. He told San Tu Ackwa, who was standing near him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I doubt that a stranger battle has ever been enacted in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">history of creation! Man and Woman in battle, each trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat the other, yet each trying to save the other for its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefit! Each wanting victory, but not wishing to sacrifice the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other to gain its point I Without a doubt we need each other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">996</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but whether our people will be willing to accept these strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures is a question. Still, I guess these women are beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their own way. But would a man be willing to see his off-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring plunging into the ocean for its daily dip?''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Japanese had nothing to say in answer to the astronomer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His serious mien revealed that he saw no humor in the other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">levity. D'Arcy felt his disapproval and smiled wryly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Seriously speaking, San," he observed, "you must admit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there has never been a queerer combat fought. But see, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">men are victorious after all I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He pointed to the ocean below, where they could see their</seg><seg type="columnLine">men rising to the spheres burdened with men and women alike.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All fight was gone from the amphibians, who were submitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">docilely enough to the capture. D'Arcy arose from his squatting</seg><seg type="columnLine">position on the floor and, followed by San Tu Ackwa, went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the corridor that led to the sphere's entrance. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the returning men with their captives, who were carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the chambers above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Commander Ware was in his own quarters, where he greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scientists with,a smile. "It appears that the victory is ours,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he observed. D'Arcy recounted the enjoyment the battle had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yet," said Ware, "we do not know but that reinforcements</seg><seg type="columnLine">are on the way. Surely these--these women haven't shot their</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire bow, they will come to succor their defenders! One ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine, you know, slipped away. I am waiting now to learn how</seg><seg type="columnLine">many casualties we liave to report. Then we will search for</seg><seg type="columnLine">land."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUST then word was received from the commandants of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres to announce that only fifteen men in all were missing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ware sighed, sorrowful that even these had to be lost. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the order for several squads to descend to the spheres on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water to discover whether the men were still living. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was then that the squeal of the radio announced the return of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their unknown friend on Venus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Congratulations, friends I It was a pretty fight 1 However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reinforcements setting out from . . .'' but with that the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted as though the speaker had been torn from his machine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the Earthlings wore forewarned. Ware barked his orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a new formation. Just then the three crippled ships were</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen to lift themselves into the air again. Reports came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them announcing that all was well aboard. A great cry went</seg><seg type="columnLine">up from the remainder of the fleet when they had seen their fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows once more rise to the air, and again the ships were pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared for battle. The Visual screens showed a half dozen cyl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inders far off in the distance hurrying to where the Earth ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited. Ware hesitated no longer. He ordered that the ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">be brought down as soon as they came within range I</seg><seg type="columnLine">But again the shrill whistle of the Venusian broadcaster was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be heard. The now familiar voice was more ringing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">exultant than before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Greetings to the valiant Earthlings from Waltia, Queen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Zoldans I" he cried. "Waltia acknowledges the Victors and</seg><seg type="columnLine">expresses a desire for a conference upon the Isle of Xora. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">asks that you permit her ships to aid her defeated flyers. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the word of the Zoldans that you are safe in their midst,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a Zoldan never breaks her word I One ship will guide you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Xora; the others will come to take their ships in tow. Arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">you agreeable?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Commander signified that he was more than willing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accept Queen Waltia's terms, and that the six approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders were to be allowed to draw near unmolested. He asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of the broadcaster, but the repeated signals on his wave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">length brought no answer. There was nothing for them to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">but follow the single ship that detached itself from the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessels and turned about preparatory to leading them to Xora.</seg><seg type="columnLine">'"We're in for a strange experience," Ware smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Stranger than fiction," D'Arcy commented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ware nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Women With Wings!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS they followed they saw that the Zoldan ships were</seg><seg type="columnLine">grappling the helpless cylinders with long metallic arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had upon their ends a great circular cup-shaped af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair, which acted either through a suction or a magnetic field</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it fastened itself to the black sides of the crippled machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bore them aloft Burdened so, they could move but slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were soon left far behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The navigators turned to their compasses, which upon enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Venus' gravitational pull had reacted exactly as they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Earth, proving that Venus also had her magnetic pole.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The compass showed that they were moving in a direction cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">responding to east, with a deviation to the south. For three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours they flew over the yellow ocean.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> D'Arcy suggested that the captive women in The Mentor be</seg><seg type="columnLine">freed from their quarters for a closer examination, so that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might know more about the women of the planet. In a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes a half dozen or so of the scaled creatures were brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth. They stood a little less than six feet in height, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be well proportioned. The wings were not half so</seg><seg type="columnLine">long as Earthly wings, and were far less powerful for flying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evidently the Zoldans did not take very long flights. The fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were scaled like fish pointed to the fact that they spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great deal more time in the water. Captive as they were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they appeard very docile, and made no attempts to rebel against</seg><seg type="columnLine">their captors; but the manner in which they held themselves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their arrogance of carriage and the pose of their heads showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they considered the men of Earth an inferior grade of be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Moreover, a certain patience of bearing was evident in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their faces, and later D'Arcy attested to the fact that he felt as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they considered him naught but a child who needed some</seg><seg type="columnLine">humoring. Only one of the women wore any adornment upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her person, and that was a girdle of a bluish metal incrusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with strange entrancing jewels. No doubt she was a personage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she held herself aloof from her fellows with the arrogance</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her face more marked than in the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Had it not been for the minute scales that covered her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her head like a cap, she would have been considered beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful according to Earthly standards. The eyes, which were al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most an emerald green, were over-large, and hidden fires seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live behind them. Her nose was very small, with nostrils that</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely appeared against the background of the glistening scales,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her mouth was of tiny proportions, with its edges of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same green color as the eyes! The shape of her face was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most a perfect oval, and the neck that supported the well-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">head was slender and well-poised upon the broad shoulders of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swimmer. Her body was slender and deep-chested, and the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was without breasts gave her a rather boyish figure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The most startling feature was the fact that between both her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers and her toes there were webbed membranes like those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a duck!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was she of the girdle to whom Commander Ware now</seg><seg type="columnLine">addressed himself. And yet from the beginning he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known that they two could not converse unless she had managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn something of the Earthly speech from one of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had captured from Earth. He did in fact address several</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarks to her, but the woman made no attempt to answer, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared with disdain upon her captor, something like a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile wreathing her strange lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Not a bad-looking creature, at that," remarked D'Arcy. "Ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pears to have a great deal of spirit and little respect for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">genus Man. Doesn't even trouble herself to attempt to converse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, something about the throat and lips tells me that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">women are not much given to speech. Perhaps they have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken language? The ears are very small and underdeveloped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too--better for receiving sound under water than atop, like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars of the fish! Fish are not known to make any sound, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">WOMEN WITH WINGS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">997</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">unless I miss ray guess these Zoldans are the direct descendants</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Teleostomi*--in other words, from common every-day</seg><seg type="columnLine">fish I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As the scientist spoke, the woman turned her eyes upon him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a smile more gentle than the one she had given Ware was</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung to him. Later D'Arcy admitted that he had had the feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that she had understood his every word; and yet, if she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood, would her smile have been so kindly?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Now she was looking about the chamber in which she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been received. Near at hand were the radio and Visual screens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her eyes lighted brightly as she saw the long shape of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-flyer of her own people moving ahead. Another screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed the water that lay below, and beyond and upon both sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">the accompanying spheres of the Earthlings. At a desk to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the room sat an officer with an array of instruments be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore him that he was manipulating as he gave directions to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine rooms and various other parts of the ship. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no query in her eyes, but understanding and something like ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miration too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ware seemed at a loss what to do with his guests, but D'Arcy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had taken a liking to the strange woman, managed to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vey to her that he would enjoy taking her about the flyer on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tour of inspection. She nodded in affirmation to his suggestion</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, followed by the other women, they made the trip, D'Arcy</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing out to them whatever he thought would be of interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">to women acquainted with the science of space-flying. Ware</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighed with relief when they had left the commandant's quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">On Venus</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ship was now nearing what appeared to be a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoreland, and for two hours they followed it. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was moving on the sandy shores, which were colored a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade of orange. It was a desolate-looking country without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">living thing to broak its monotony. Far inland could be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">several dark splotches of purplish hue, but whether or not these</seg><seg type="columnLine">were vegetation they could not tell. Twice they passed what</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be small cities, but different from any they had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen, cities that appeared to have been constructed of building</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocks such as a child plays with. Each block was of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">black material as the Zoldan space-flyers and was set in geo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">metrical arrangements; and in no case were they higher than</seg><seg type="columnLine">two levels. Facing the water could be noted a single doorway</seg><seg type="columnLine">without another opening to break the smooth walls. And in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities not a living creature was to be seen, yet the Earthlings</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the feeling that they were being watched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The sea coast was again left behind. To the cast appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">another long coast-line, but they did not follow it but proceeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">due south over the water until they sighted a large island. Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the island was, covered by the black blocks which made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking contrast against the background of the orange sand. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the exact center of the island that they saw a building</seg><seg type="columnLine">which differed from the rest of the city. Here, in a square of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous proportions, with a black surfacing, was set a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">square building and instead of the conventional black it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snowy white.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Once more the friendly voice was heard in the radio, ordering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ships to descend to the square in front of the white build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Ware directed their descent and one by one the spheres</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled to the ground in rows of three. The Mentor was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last to land and stood facing the single doorway of the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">building. The cylinder that had guided them hither was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">             CHAPTER IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">             The Matriarch</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">D'ARCY had by this time returned from his tour with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Zoldans. Ware ordered that the women be returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the quarters set aside for them, and turned to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> •	A class of fishes with well developed jawbones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of discmbarkment. He and D'Arcy and the two Japanese</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the only ones to leave The Mentor. Reaching the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the square they saw that it was of a sleek metal and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been laid in a single strip with no expansion strips. With sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise they noted that the building they were facing was transpar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent, and that every article within was clearly visible from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">square 1 The black buildings also were found to be transparent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but their color made this feature less apparent, and figures with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in could barely be discerned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a great deal of movement within the Palace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Queen Waltia, where figures moving back and forth or stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing near the walls peered out upon the strange vessels of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">victorious Earthlings. Then from the doorway came a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">band of women preceded by one who towered above the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">by almost six inches. Weird they were, with their strange scaly</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering and their narrow scaled wings. Almost fantastic they</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to the Earthlings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">All of the twenty women were ornamented with girdles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">different designs, vying with each other in splendor. The girdle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the foremost one was an exquisite bit of workmanship entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered by jewels of all shapes and colors, many of which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hues never seen in precious stones upon Earth. The woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself was a striking creature, statuesque and beautifully pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portioned, with a face that appeared chiseled from living stone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her eyes of emerald, however, were almost too large for beauty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her mouth was uncommonly small.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She came to a halt with her party within ten feet of the group</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaiting her, and stood there quietly without a word, surveying</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as they surveyed her. It was then that the Earthlings per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived that in her retinue there was a familiar figure, one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own race!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">At a motion from the Queen--for she was indeed Waltia--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthling detached himself from the group and, after extend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his left arm toward the woman in some manner of salute,</seg><seg type="columnLine">addressed his fellow-men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Matriarch extends her greeting and her good-will to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of Earth," he declared. "She wishes to express her deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiration for men who have so bravely attacked her formidable</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft And she observes that it is indeed surprising to her that</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings of our sex show great courage as well as such an array</seg><seg type="columnLine">of scientific knowledge. She feels that after all, even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">you be men, she need not be shamed by your victory over her</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors, for you are undoubtedly people of great accomplish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE last was said with a broad smile which the Matriarch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the interpreter saw fit to call her, did not see, since he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was facing his fellow-men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ware could not help but smile with him. "We of Earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other hand," observed the Commander, "are equally sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised to learn that Queen Waltia has such a poor opinion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our sex. We arc also astounded that the female of the species</seg><seg type="columnLine">has proven such a worthy foe to the Lords of Creation I" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">said this with a little smirk he could not keep from his lips. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been many centuries since men had used those terms, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt that the occasion called for them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Turning to the queen, the interpreter began in a strange hum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mining tone to explain what the commander had said. They saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smile play upon the woman's lips. She, too, recognized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">irony of his remarks. Then she took a step forward and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended her right hand to Ware. The Earthling had no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstrated to her the Earthly manner of salute. The Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mander stepped forward and took her hand in his. If he had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected to find her flesh cold to his touch he was mistaken, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was warm and vibrant with health, and her clasp was hearty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">With that done, she turned to the Earthling at her side and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same humming sound that had come to his lips now slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from hers. He interpreted her words: "Her majesty suggests</seg><seg type="columnLine">that perhaps it would be well for you to permit your men to</seg><seg type="columnLine">descend from their cramped quarters. There is nothing to fear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">998</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as she lias given her word guaranteeing their safety. They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">given the freedom of the planet I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nodding, Ware turned to The Mentor and waved an arm. Im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately one of his officers appeared and the order was given</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the men to land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are holding approximately three thousand women cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive," he advised the Queen's interpreter, "and I would prefer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep them prisoners until we learn what terms we may reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Matriarch. I trust she will be agreeable to that condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other nodded. "Her majesty is aware of the fact that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">retain her fellow-women until suitable terms can be made."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He answered without bothering to address the queen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Kiter Explains</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW, one by one, the spheres were being emptied of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">crews. In each, a small detail of men were to be left to</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard the women. The men quickly fell into formation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood at attention awaiting the next command of their leader.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ware gave the order for them to relax, while he looked for in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structions from the queen's interpreter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Arrangements have already been made for the quartering of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your men within the houses that face the square, which have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been vacated for that purpose. There they will be looked after</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the .women. However, it will be quite agreeable to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">majesty if you prefer to leave a number of your men to guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">your machines, although that precaution is entirely unnecessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As for yourself and your party, the Matriarch will be pleased</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have you accompany her to the palace where we can discuss</seg><seg type="columnLine">the present situation ill comfort."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ware nodded and gave directions to his officers for the care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men; then with Professor D'Arcy and San Tu Ackwa and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yoto Murca he followed the queen and her retinue to the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">transparent palace. The doorway was a circular opening with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crystal of tremendous size suspended in lieu of a door. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cut with exquisite care and its facets caught and reflected</seg><seg type="columnLine">the half-lights that filtered through the ever-present tloud banks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The building itself was a great rectangle measuring fully a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand by two thousand feet, and was three levels high. Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through the doorway they found themselves in a room of</seg><seg type="columnLine">large proportions, with no furnishings other than an immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">throne chair set on a dais at the opposite side of the room. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was of a deep emerald green color, and appeared to have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut from a single stone. Through the walls of the room they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could plainly see the square beyond, with the spheres and men</seg><seg type="columnLine">now maneuvering in answer to their officer's commands. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not pause in this chamber, but went directly through to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second room. Here at the doorways were stationed women who</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood at attention as the company came through. In the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, which was furnished simply with a dozen large chairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the backs cut low to provide room for the wings to dangle</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground behind, the queen halted. All but one of her fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowers went on through the next doorway, and were seen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrange themselves upon chairs in the adjoining room. Turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her guests, Waltia motioned for them to be seated. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthly interpreter took his position at her chair. Later he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">his name as Jack Kiter. He had been a metallurgist on a holi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day at Miami at the coming of the Zoldan flyer to Earth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had the misfortune to be captured by the winged women.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only he did not appear to consider it a misfortune, as the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">were presently to discover!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IMMEDIATELY after they had seated themselves comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably, a half dozen women who, unlike the others, wore no</seg><seg type="columnLine">girdles, came in bearing small tables upon each of which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">set a single yellow bowl and beside it a long pencil-shaped wand</seg><seg type="columnLine">with prongs at one end. A table was set before each man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Happening to glance behind him. Ware was surprised that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see out into the square almost as clearly as if three walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not intervene. There he could see hundreds of flying women</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">moving among his men, bearing trays of yellow bowls! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowl set before him he found to contain a thick greenish liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which were floating a number of bits of what looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">boiled flesh. The flesh was a vivid red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Zoldans," observed Kiter from his post beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">queen, "live entirely upon water-life--fish, squids, sea serpents</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other forms of life which I am unable to name. Sea-wccds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of different varieties are ground into a sort of flour and baked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though one or two varieties are eaten in their raw state. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">will find this dish tasty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Earthlings stared at the food a little questioningly, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they saw the queen spearing the flesh lumps with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange fork they did likewise and were surprised that the food</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rather good, although the fish flavor was strong. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solid food was gone they looked up to see what their hostess</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do next, and saw that she had already put the bowl to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lips to drink the liquid. It was stinging hot, but it had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">aromatic flavor that was refreshing. With the food consumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dishes and tables were removed and the visitors waited for</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was to come next</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Strange Race</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE queen had turned to Kiter and for several moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">her humming tones persisted. Then the interpreter began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak to his fellow-men. "Queen Waltia wishes me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell you something about her world, which is called by her</seg><seg type="columnLine">people Zolda. It is a world composed mostly of water, and what</seg><seg type="columnLine">land there is lies grouped loosely together in islands. There are</seg><seg type="columnLine">still a great many of these islands that have never been visited.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To the Earthly eye it is a strange world with its ochre yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas, its orange sand, its purple, red and blue foliage. Much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ocean bed is very shallow, although there are regions in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the bottom has never been reached, but on the whole it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more than from six to seven fathoms in depth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is natural, therefore, that the Zoldans should liave had</seg><seg type="columnLine">their beginnings in the water. Their scientists, like those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth, still seek for the missing links in their history in fossils</seg><seg type="columnLine">found for the most part in the silt on the bottom of the oceans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first the life of the Zoldans was spent under the surface. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in water so shallow, it is not strange that they should have lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves out of that element by their wings, which were de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped from finny appendages along the backbone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the beginning they merely skimmed the water for a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance of eight to ten feet before they dropped back into it, much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as do the flying-fish of our own oceans. Then gradually the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fins changed to wings that could lift them a little higher and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a greater distance. At the same time they were developing</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lungs until they could, if they wished, live almost entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the water in the heavy moist atmosphere of their world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You can sec the small gill slits, that you perhaps have taken for</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears, by which they breath the oxygen in the water when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are swimming under the surface. Now they can no longer stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the water more than half an hour to an hour at a time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, gradually through the ages, as their lungs have developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the expense of their gills, they have been losing their ability</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live as amphibians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It may astonish you also to learn that they have 110 organ of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing. Instead, the voice sets up a scries of vibrations in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very sensitive nerves of the skin surface, and these register upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brain. Loud noises are vastly disturbing to their delicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous system for this reason. We have discovered that music</seg><seg type="columnLine">and singing are very pleasant to them, and they have looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward to our perfection of the radio, upon which a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our people have been working.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"■V TOW, the Zoldans live entirely upon the sea coast and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> X&gt;| rarely go inland except to mine the various metals with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they have learned to work. It is from the water that</seg><seg type="columnLine">WOMEN WITH WINGS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">999</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they obtain their food, and it is upon the water that they breed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their young, for the Zoldans are an egg-bearing race, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">eggs have to be incubated in the water. It takes three months</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the young to hatch, and much care is given them in specially</seg><seg type="columnLine">built vats in sheltered coves along the seashores.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The strangest feature of the Zoldans is that from the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning of time the female has always been the dominent sex,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the male being accepted by them only as a biological necessity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As an intelligent being he is practically nil. He is physically a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakling, so that all labor falls upon the shoulders of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women. And now for many ages man has been slowly dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, for although the women have done all they could to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sex, there seems nothing to save him, and his birth-rate is</seg><seg type="columnLine">very low--only one male to every SO -females born. There is also</seg><seg type="columnLine">a disease that attacks the grown males, for which there seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">no cure. The Zoldans, therefore, are faced with a problem that</seg><seg type="columnLine">equals that of our own planet, and the raid they made upon us</seg><seg type="columnLine">was simply a means to save their race. They had visited Mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cury for this purpose before they tried the Earth, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no life upon that little planet. Of course, they were elated</seg><seg type="columnLine">on discovering not only that Earth was inhabitated, but also</seg><seg type="columnLine">tliat its peoples were winged like themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We captives have had a difficult time m striving to prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them that Man can be the equal of Woman, and they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">now grudgingly admitting that this is so. Your feat today in</seg><seg type="columnLine">besting them lias proved to them that they are not superior to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When their ships met you out in the void they were as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tounded to learn that you had succeeded in conquering space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they believed that once you arrived on their planet they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyze all your ships and capture you easily. They them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves were bound for Earth to make a second and larger cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, for they had now completed their experiments and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered that they could successfully breed with us. Naturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, when they found that you were arriving with thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men, they were content that you were bringing yourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them and saving them the journey to Earth I Consequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were wholly unprepared for your attack on them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But since you have proved yourselves worthy of their mettle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and since you, like themselves, have a scarcity of the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">sex, they are willing to capitulate and make a fair exchange</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you--to send to Earth just as many of their women as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth will give of men!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Truce</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">E, who have been captured, have agreed that this is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution to our problems. Zolda, or Venus as we call</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, has much to give to Earth besides her women, and Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">can fairly exchange with her. The planet has wonderful re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sources, many of which still remain untapped. There arc metals</seg><seg type="columnLine">and jewels tliat will be invaluable to Earth, metals of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardness and lightness that they would indeed be of a value</seg><seg type="columnLine">that now seems incredible I And in return Earth has much to</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer Venus. In several branches of science the Zoldans have</seg><seg type="columnLine">l&gt;een backward because they lack some of the necessary equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. But if our peoples would be willing to make exchanges,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inhabitants of both planets could progress along lines that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the past would have seemed like miracles 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will find the women of Venus a happy, pleasant populace</seg><seg type="columnLine">who for all their science are almost childlike in some matters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are anxious now for our two worlds to become friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they will do all they can to bring this about. And they</seg><seg type="columnLine">plead that the Earthlings forgive their temerity in having dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to capture what Earthlings they did, for it was done through</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer ignorance upon their part. They believed the men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our world to be the same weak creatures that men are on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, and did not dream to find them as intelligent and as ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced as themselves I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">When Kiter had concluded his narrative, the Earthlings were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">silent The story they had heard was indeed a strange one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They knew not what to answer Queen Waltia. True, here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a solution to their own problem ready to hand, but would the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of Earth be willing to accept these strange amphibians</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their midst? And would the intermingling of these bloods</seg><seg type="columnLine">be practical? Would not such an interchange cause a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">race to come into being upon their own fair globe? Would it</seg><seg type="columnLine">not mean that the habits of the Earthlings must be changed?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would it not affect their whole manner of living? Would they</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue to be the great fair-minded race that they were at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">present time? It was indeed a momentous decision that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthlings were called upon to makel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quietly the four men discussed these questions among them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves. Kiter had explained that the Matriarch would not ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject to their conversing together apart. He was listening quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, but after a few minutes he addressed a question to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Waltia. She nodded at what he had to say, and gave an order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one of the attendants standing in the doorway. A minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">later the woman came back carrying what turned out to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">young Zoldan, or rather a child that was of both Zoldan and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthly parentage</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was a child of about two months but it had the appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a year-old youngster. Its face was that of an Earthly</seg><seg type="columnLine">child with fair skin, but its eyes were abnormally large while</seg><seg type="columnLine">its body was covered with the tiny fish scales that caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light and reflected it like a prism. Its hands had no webs, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">its wings resembled those of its maternal race, shorter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slenderer with none of the power of the Earthling wings. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings were almost wholly covered with scales, except where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they joined the body, where there was a suggestion of soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">down that would grow into feathers as it grew older.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The four men examined the child carefully. It was a pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby, and showed great interest in the strange men. They .ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amined the wings which they thought were poor substitutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their own wings, but D'Arcy was certain that were they</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed properly they could be made to grow stronger. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps the Earth's scientists could increase them with their glands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and formulas, as Mentor had first evolved wings upon a wing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less people. Still, to the Earthlings, the baby was a queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">little thing and its appearance was somewhat distasteful to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastidious minds. The queen, who had been watching their de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ception of the child and their examination, turned again to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">attendant, who went away to do her bidding. She returned with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second child. They saw that this one was entirely free from</seg><seg type="columnLine">scales on the trunk and limbs, but that his round head was</seg><seg type="columnLine">capped with them instead of hair, and that the wings, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger than the first baby's, were completely covered with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This child," explained Kiter, "is bom of an Earth mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a Zoldan father, for you know that there were a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our women in our midst when we were captured. The mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">died when the baby was bom, for unlike the other child he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">born from the mother instead of from an egg."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "H'm . . meditated D'Arcy. "It would be more interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see what several generations of these offspring would bring!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kiter spoke several moments to the queen and then addressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fellow-men. "Her majesty can not quite understand your</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitancy in accepting these children, but she agrees that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be well first for the matter to be brought up before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet ruler. She would suggest, therefore, that you return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth with a dozen or so of her women and their offspring to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be taken before the Mentor. In the meantime, however, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">insists that she keep on Zolda the men she has captured. If the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthlings decide against the importation of the Zoldan women,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she will return all the Earthlings who wish to return to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">otm planet I The decision will rest with you who are the vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors, and if you do not wish to breed with her people she still</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes that the Earthlings will be willing to accept her people as</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends and allow commerce to be carried on between the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">worlds! She has learned already that her people need us, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">10&lt;XL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">above all the Zoldans are fair-minded. They do not begrudge</seg><seg type="columnLine">you your victory, but admit that you have beaten them fairly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The four men conferred together for several moments and</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed that the terms were more than fair. But first they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn whether their people were content upon the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, until the planet ruler could come to a decision. Kiter</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled at that. Very few of the captured Earthlings, it seemed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rebelling against their loti There was so much here to</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest them that they had scarcely had time to feel any pangs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of homesickness. And they were finding that the amphibians</seg><seg type="columnLine">were congenial mates I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Night on Venus</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HILE they had been speaking, the night had been de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scending upon the planet, although a shaded light still</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingered in the heavens. There had been a magnificent</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunset as the rays of the sun were reflected upon the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud banks, painting them in gorgeous colors that ranged from</seg><seg type="columnLine">vermilion reds to dark violets. The men had only to lift their</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes above and see it all through the transparent ceilings of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and the roof two levels above theni.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For many centuries Earthlings had questioned whether or not</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus rotates upon her axis, or whether, like Mercury, it has</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a single rotation during its solar year.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now with the coming of night the Matriarch spoke again</seg><seg type="columnLine">through her interpreter. "The Zoldans retire with the setting</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun, gentlemen," the latter explained. "Although they do</seg><seg type="columnLine">have artificial light, they seldom utilize it, preferring to sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the sun's setting and awake with its rising. I am directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escort you to your sleeping chamber."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They saw that the queen was rising from her chair and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nod of her head she was gone, followed by her attendants, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been waiting in the adjoining room. Ware was first anxious</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn whether his men had been cared for, and Kiter pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the square which, with the exception of the spheres and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">few men left to guard them, was deserted. He assured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commander that he had no need to worry about his battalions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that the women had their care at heart. Then he led them</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a corridor to an inclined ramp that took them to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second floor of the palace to a large room, wherein were half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen couches for their use. All. around them through the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could see the rooms filled with couches upon which women</seg><seg type="columnLine">were already sleeping. Beyond the walls they could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">square black blocks of houses whose walls were less trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I believe," conjectured D'Arcy, "that there is an old proverb</seg><seg type="columnLine">that tells us, 'people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones!' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KITER grinned. "Only, professor, these houses are not of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass ... but of metal I Almost all Zoldan metals are</seg><seg type="columnLine">transparent. The black metal that is called ctilula is only semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">opaque, and is used as the general rule for building. The space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyers are built of it, but since their early history the palaces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their rulers have always been built of liclula; ior the simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason that all the world can watch their movements and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be no treachery 1 And one simply becomes accustomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">having every movement seen by his fellow-man. He is then not</seg><seg type="columnLine">so apt to break the laws or to hold secrets I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a half bad idea at that 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How is it that they use no lights?" demanded San To</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ackwa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They have, in the first place, little use for lighting, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange as it may seem, they have never developed their natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">resources to a very great extent. Fire is rarely used by them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and electricity is an unknown quantity. In cooking, as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">for generating power, they use atomic heat, having a means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of disintegrating the atoms through a cosmic ray whose base</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I	have not as yet been able to learn. With it they drive their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">engines and motors, but they have not as yet learned how to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">produce light. When they need light they use a strange phos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">phorescent stone that sends off a small glow. By a unique array</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of mirrors and lenses they are able to focus this glow and so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to obtain a tremendous amount of light which they are enabled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to direct in any direction they desire. It takes great care and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fine workmanship to grind the proper lenses, so one can readily</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">see why light is not generally used in their homes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And what type of ray was it that they used for paralyzing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you when you were captured? And in the radio and power</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plants?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That is not a ray but a gas that is found below the ocean</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beds. When using it the Zoldans cover their heads with masks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and breathe from oxygen tanks. The gas docs not affect their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">engines as it does ours. Why it should react upon our motors</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and not theirs is a problem that Dr. Howard Cross is working</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon. In fishing for the sea creatures which they use for food</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this gas is used, since it permeates the water as well as the air</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--even more readily in fact. It paralyzes the creatures but does</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not kill, for the Zoldans will not eat food which is not put into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the kettle alive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It seems to me," observed D'Arcy, "that for a people so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">versed in certain fields they are sadly lacking in knowledge in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">others."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Kiter Confesses</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">KITER nodded. "Yes, it is strange that they have not carried</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their development evenly along all lines. Nor would you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">consider them a cultured people by Earth's standards. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have no music, no recreational amusements of any kind, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they are not at all interested in education. They have no written</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">language, and their mode of accounting seems childish, yet they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have a great amount of native shrewdness and they are quick</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to grasp a subject once it is laid out before them. Furthermore,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their understanding of mechanics without a mathematical back-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ground is phenomenonal. You must have noticed, also, that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their manner of speech is very crude. I consider, in fact, that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their backwardness in various subjects is due to their lack of an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">organized coherent language. There are actually no distinct</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">word sounds, but the inflections of the voice and the narrowing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and opening of its volume mean innumerable things to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was most difficult for us of Earth to learn at all, and only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a few of us have really mastered it. We often have much dif-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ficulty in giving names to objects, and the names I have given</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you are really of our own devising, based upon their own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sounds."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You appear to get along well with the queen, Kiter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He grinned broadly in .the dark. "Oh, we understand each</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other. That's all. What I told you of their history took me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quite a while to learn, but these women have all the patience</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the world and will tire themselves out in an attempt to teach</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">us what they want us to learn. They are as anxious to learn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as we are ourselves, and I have managed to teach Waltia a few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">words of our language. She is quick to learn, but it means a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">great amount of time spent in developing the vocal cords. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">really doubt that she will ever become an orator, but her voice</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tones are beautiful for all that. And she has given us permis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">' sion to teach the offspring of our two races to speak. The two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little tykes you saw can really talk a blue streak already, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they are rather shy with strangers. The young develop very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quickly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But tell us, Kiter, honestly, are you content in this gray,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">misty world? Don't you miss a sight of the sun once in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">while and don't you long to breathe the clear fresh air of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mountain tops? Surely you don't find this world half so pleasant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as Earth?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">WHEN Kiter answered his voice was wistful. "Yes, it is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">true that we miss that more than we care to say, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">WOMEN WITH WINGS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1001</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all have the hope that one day we may return home. Still, on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the other hand, all that seems humdrum now, and Zolda does</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not leave us time to feel any monotony. As for color, this world</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is filled with it, and wffen we grow tired of the water we can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fly for many miles over strange landscapes. As for music, we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shall soon broadcast good programs, for George Morrow now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">has his radio completed and is busy at the present time install-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing his first great station, and he has a corps of men and women</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at work building the receiving sets. After all, life on Earth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flows in well-oiled unchanging streams, while here there is still</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">great adventure to be found, and we have not yet reached the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">point where we will tire. No, life is quite enjoyable here on this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strange world, and its women are pleasant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see. After all, there is little in the way of home ties on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth to hold you, and you have here a world almost in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">making. I could almost envy you," said Commander Ware.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And ... by the way, about that radio. Was it this George</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morrow whose voice gave us warning?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kiter nodded. "And the women almost murdered him when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they learned what he was about! To them radio is almost a</seg><seg type="columnLine">magic science, and when they first discovered its possibilities</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were overjoyed with it. But when they discovered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had dared to warn his fellow-beings they were furious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, Waltia intervened. She did not consider his act one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of treason, for she admits that in his place her women would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done the same I She was astounded to learn that she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch the battle taking placc in the Visual screen which Morrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">had perfected so that the scene was projected to his machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the background of the clouds overhead. Morrow, jf you</seg><seg type="columnLine">recall, was the co-inventor of a number of improvements of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tele-Visual. Waltia watched the entire battle by its means and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was she who gave directions for him to declare a truce and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to invite you to Xora!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "H'ml I wonder if our people would have been so magnani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous in a like circumstance? History rarely tells of souls so</seg><seg type="columnLine">great and understanding as she 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is true I have never met a woman or a man for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, who shows such a breadth of mind and soul."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You call her the Matriarch. Is that the term her people</seg><seg type="columnLine">use?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, she is merely their ruler. They have no word sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">for queen or anything to designate their leaders, but hers is</seg><seg type="columnLine">truly a qucenship or Matriarchy. There are other leaders among</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, women who hold their position because of heritage, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Waltia is acknowledged their ruler, for through her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">superiority of leadership she outranks them all. Those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">wear the girdle are of the nobility lines among them, the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">are the commanders, but really there is no other distinct line</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn. All work for the common good..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, gentlemen, if you will pardon ray interruption. I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggest that you get some sleep now. The nights of Zolda are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not over-long, due to the thick atmosphere which radiates the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's heat long before the sun has arisen. Tomorrow Waltia</seg><seg type="columnLine">wishes that you be taken on a tour of inspection, and I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt but that you are in need of rest"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men agreed that they needed sleep, and began to settle</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves on the couches, which were extremely soft Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amination of the texture of the cloth that covered them and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blankets, revealed that they were woven of a species of sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weed that still retained a sweet though elusive odor. Kiter</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited only for the Earthlings to be settled before he took him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self off. They could see him moving in the gloom several rooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Then all was quiet, as the weary men dropped off to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XII</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morning!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS Kiter had said, the night was short and dawn came long</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the sun rose. When Ware and his fellows awoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">L the sky was being painted in beautiful colors, far more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lovely than it was possible for any sunrise upon Earth to be.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And through the ceiling and roof above, the Earthlings watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shifting shades as they crept from cloud to cloud. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognizing their surroundings again, after the first surprise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unfamiliar scene, they looked about them and saw that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepers in the rooms about had already arisen. Looking through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor they could see Jack Kiter seated in a chair, awaiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">their arising no doubt. In fact, as they arose he looked up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw them and waved a hand. Then he went hurrying up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ramp to their chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He greeted them brightly. "Sorry we have no better accommo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dations here; there is no running water to be had," he advised,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but after clapping his hands four of the Zoldan women appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing round bowls filled with water. There were towels of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woven sea grasses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After their ablutions in the tepid soft water they were ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to descend below. In the square they found the spUeres just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been left the night before, all deserted except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their guards. On looking seaward they were now greeted by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange sight. Above the square blocks of the black houses</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be seen thousands upon thousands of the winged women</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air, diving and cavorting in a queer manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Come," said Kiter, "if you wish to see our hostesses at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning bath! You see, during the night the air cools a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal and becomes rather dry, and it is necessary for the Zoldans</seg><seg type="columnLine">.0 keep their flesh damp. Much of their breathing is through</seg><seg type="columnLine">their pores, and, as in the frog, that is impossible if the skin is</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry. Hence it is a morning rite with them to go down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water for their bath. They become quite sluggish if they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept from the water."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taking wing, the five flew over the house tops to the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore. They could now see that the ocean was dotted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">amphibians. The Zoldans would soar several hundred feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, then close their wings and drop like plummets into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, throwing the spray high. For a few minutes they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">play in the water, surfacing, diving and swimming several</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards beneath the surface, to rise again and repeat the plunge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Along the beaches standing in the surf were a number of women</seg><seg type="columnLine">with babies in their 'arms whom they would carefully lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the water for the space of a minute. To one side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering they could see a number of half-grown Zoldans</seg><seg type="columnLine">imitating their mothers, only their play was more exciting as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they chased »ch other in short races.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"r\0 you know," observed D'Arcy, "that we haven't seen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1	J a single male Zoldan ? They are evidently very scarce,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or do they keep apart from the women?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In answer Kiter scanned the crowds and from time to time</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out a single scaly man or two in a group. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly smaller than the women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down the beach Ware noted a band of his soldiers standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">by and watching their hostesses with much glee. On seeing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader, several officers detached themselves from the group and</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached Commander Ware. They reported that all was well</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their battalions. The three captains of the ships which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been paralyzed by the Zoldan gas made their appearance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They reported that their ships were little the worse for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience. Only one of their number, the Skylark, lad received</seg><seg type="columnLine">any damage. Two of the plates of the outside shell had sprung a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leak, but only a small amount of water had seeped in. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain had ordered that a number of his men repair the damage</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately and he was certain that all would be well with it</seg><seg type="columnLine">henceforth. On learning of the accident the two Japanese in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventors were troubled and, excusing themselves from the group,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried to examine the damage. Later, upon hearing about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, the Matriarch ordered that a coating of ceilula, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black metal of the Zoldans, be used to seal the break. The stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">was brought in a liquid form and applied like a paste. In less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than half an hour it hardened and nothing was found that could</seg><seg type="columnLine">1002</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">chip it. To ascertain that the work had been done correctly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">queen examined it herself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Shortly after the Earthlings had arrived on the beach, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winged women had returned from their bath. Kiter lead his</seg><seg type="columnLine">party into the palace and in the room where they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">received the day before they were served their breakfast. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">consisted of a sweetish bread made from sea-weeds and a drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was of a white color and tasted like milk. Kiter explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was indeed the milk of a sea-mammal tliat resembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">an Earthly whale. Large 'icrds of these creatures were kept by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Zoldans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ready to Return</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was after the meal that Ware recalled the women whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earthlings had been holding captive within the spheres.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was apologetic about having held them thus long. Directions</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their release were sent to one of the officers of the fleet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the women were set free. D'Arcy looked for the girdled woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had intrigued his fancy, and learned that she ranked only</seg><seg type="columnLine">below Queen Waltia. She appeared to hold no animosity toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">her captors, and after she had returned from her morning bath</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sea, she presented herself to the queen and her guests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was she who elected to accompany the Earthlings with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kiter on a tour of inspection around the island. Kiter gave her</seg><seg type="columnLine">name as Kal. On meeting her late captors, she had greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with a smile and a single word upon her lips--"Hello 1"</seg><seg type="columnLine">It turned out that one of the guards who had been left in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere with the women had painstakingly taught her this 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her voice was melodious, the 1's liquid, and she had managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give the word a wealth of tone. She appeared to be on good</seg><seg type="columnLine">terms with Kilter, and several times she laughed at something</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told her in their odd humming sounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That day was spent in visiting many buildings that housed</seg><seg type="columnLine">various kinds of factories. On the far end of the island, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was approximately fifteen miles long, were large smelting vats</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the raw ore of the ceilula was turned into liquid and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">into small blocks which could be liquified again when it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed. They saw the mills that turned out many of the neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sities used by the Zoldans and the sheds where the Zoldan eggs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hatched. Here were the incubators for those of common</seg><seg type="columnLine">birth, where thousands of the eggs were placed in a foot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water that was kept at a proper temperature. The eggs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft, and measured but three inches when first put in the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cubators, but they grew until they reached eighteen inches in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length. Then the shell grew hard until the time when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngster was ready to be hatched. There were many varieties</seg><seg type="columnLine">of incubators for the offspring of the various ranks among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women. Only those of the queens were kept wholly apart and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were known to their own mothers. In all other cases the mother,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on depositing an egg in the vats, was given a card that entitled</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to a child when hatching time came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT afternoon the Zoldan world was treated to the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">public broadcasting of the new radio station on the planet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amplifiers had been set up in various parts of the cities, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most strategic points. To the Earthlings much of what went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unintelligible, as it was in the Zoldan language, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did enjoy a short progam of singing, or rather humming, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which a dozen Zoldans 'took part. Their harmony was strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Earthly ears, but, as Kiter said, it was a big step for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Zoldans, and it had taken several months for Howard Rath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been a musical instructor in the Florida Conservatory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to teach the women to "sing" together in tune.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One more night the Earthlings spent upon Zolda. The next</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning after the "swim" the Matriarch received them in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throne room seated upon the chair that was cut from a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewel. The assembly chamber was filled to overflowing, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside in the square were crowded the thousands that could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not find room in the chamber. The announcement of the terms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of treaty that had been accepted by Commander Ware was re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">peated in the Zoldan language, and the names of the two dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">women who were to go to Earth were announced. A half dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Earthlings that had lived for the past eight months on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet were to_accompany their fellows to explain just what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had discovered about the Zoldans and to demonstrate to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet ruler the uses of the varieties of strange metals that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being shipped on the spheres to Earth. Waltia was also</seg><seg type="columnLine">sending a large assortment of jewels as a tribute to the Earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She made a long speech that was translated by Kiter, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect that she was anxiously looking forward to a brotherhood</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Earthlings and trusted that in the future both worlds</seg><seg type="columnLine">would receive benefit from such a union.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they left the council chamber to go into the square.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crews and fighting battalions were waiting at attention for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the order to embark into the spheres. A salute was given the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zoldans, and then quietly and in orderly fashion they filed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the space-flyers. The band of Zoldan women with the children</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were to accompany them were taken into The Mentor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With them went the six Earthlings who were to act as inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preters. D'Arcy was first to note that the girdle-wearer Kal</seg><seg type="columnLine">was among the women. He turned to Kiter. "Why don't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">come with us, too?" he inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Long Journey</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KITER saw fit to blush, then he stammered. "Sorry, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's a great deal for me to do here. Besides, you see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her majesty has taken rather a liking to me . . . and we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">great friends. I think I can do more here than upon Earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soon, we'll have our radios and Tele-Visual perfected so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">communication between Earth and Venus will be a fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, good luck and bon voyage ... as they used to say 1"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Almost with regret D'Arcy saw the island of Xora fade</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the mists as they took their course upward again. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sorry they had not spent more time upon the planet, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt that he had really learned very little about it. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he promised himself that he would return with the next ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedition, and perhaps he could arrange to stay on the world for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several years. There was something for the astronomers to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn here about lens grinding 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soon the swirling cloud-banks of Venus, or Zolda rather,</seg><seg type="columnLine">faded away. To the right of them glowed the great sun. Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay ahead, a beautiful shining planet that to the Earth men far</seg><seg type="columnLine">surpassed the beauty of its fellow-worlds, even that strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">lovely planet of Mars, whose brilliant color out in the void was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of blood. The trip home was made more quickly than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outcommg one had been, and was wholly uneventful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon The Mentor the only diversion came from their guests.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The women had been given the entire run of the ship, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">interpreters were never idle as the women inquired into every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. Kal had set about to learn more about the controls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sphere than she had discovered on her first trip therein.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And she seemed determined to learn the Earthly tongue, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinually demanding the names of every object in sight to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she pointed with her webbed fingers. D'Arcy, who had been so</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken with the woman, resolved that just as soon as it could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly arranged he intended to ask for permission to adopt</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, if she would be agreeable to such an arrangement. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never married and was without a single tie. Kal, he thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a daughter who would be a n^ver ending source of</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoyment. She too seemed to have taken a great liking to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomer, and appeared to derive some comfort when in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence among these men of a strange world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE children the women had brought gave a great deal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure to the crew of The Mentor, for they were lively</seg><seg type="columnLine">little things. One in particular was already attempting to crawl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his large bright eyes were always questing for something</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold his attention. Jestingly they called him Venus. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">WOMEN WITH WINGS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1003</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, the last few hours of the journey were anything but</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant to him, since one of the soldiers daringly handed him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of chocolate, which he immediately devoured. The women</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been feeding the babies entirely on the milk of the sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cows of their world, which they carried in sealed bottles, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chocolate was wholly indigestible to the little fellow. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman who had charge of the baby cast angry glances at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miscreant, and more than one man liad his hands slapped when</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a joke they attempted to feed more chocolate to the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngsters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The long days of the journey had passed and now they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching Earth. Just outside of Earth's atmospheric blanket</seg><seg type="columnLine">communication with Earth was established and thereafter they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were constantly in touch with their fellows. The Mentor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his staff were waiting in the wide square before the government</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat in Havana, and great crowds for many miles about awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landing of the spheres. As the spheres one by one disem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barked their crews, arms reached out for the travelers as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">delighted Earthlings crowded around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ware with his officers and the group of scientists were re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived in an open clearing maintained by guards. Little talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be done in the hubbub of sound that swelled and beat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ears, and the police had difficulty in forcing open a path</seg><seg type="columnLine">by which they could reach the quiet of the building beyond to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make their reports. It was then that a strange and terrific noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst forth, causing Ware in sudden fear to look around for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of Zoldans who, under the guard of their interpreters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have been walking behind. He saw that they were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sight! . . . Then he found them!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the centcr of the square was a fountain with a fairly large</seg><seg type="columnLine">sized pool. A great crowd had gathered there and were ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citedly screaming and gesticulating, pointing at something in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water. Ware and D'Arcy, with the Mentor following close</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, unaware of what had happened, flew above the heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the milling masses to the fountain. They were astounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find that the twenty-four women with their babies were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying prone in the water, while the six men whose duty it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to care for them were trying to force the laughing crowds to</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth Again I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T Ware's query, Charlie West, who had the women in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge, explained that the noise of the crowds had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">too much for the women, who were unaccustomed to loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">grating sounds, and they were merely seeking quiet under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water! They had smelt the presence of water, and had flown</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it by an unerring intuition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mentor immediately dispatched orders for the square to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be cleared and the crowds quieted. When the noise eventually</seg><seg type="columnLine">died down, the women were enticed from the pool. A house</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjoining that of the planet ruler was immediately made ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them. There in the patio was a small fountain which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentor ordered removed and a large pool constructed for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of the women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For three days the Earthlings celebrated the return of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-flyers, although any noise was forbidden within several</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand yards of the house wherein the Zoldans were quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered. Memorial services were also said for the fifteen men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had died in the battle on Venus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mentor took up the business of studying the Zoldan</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation. A number of the women and children were sent on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tour of the world, and scientists made thorough examination</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, but it was many years before it was agreed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthlings were to breed with the Zoldans. First of all, trade</seg><seg type="columnLine">was established between the two planets, and the Earthlings</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned to look with favor upon the amphibians. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after several generations of cautious co-mingling it was found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the inter-breeding was beneficial to the race. Women no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer had to die in giving birth to their young, and the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of scales on their bodies was not distasteful to the new race.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nor were the Earthlings to become amphibians, for each new</seg><seg type="columnLine">generation turned to the water less and less as time passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime the Earthlings upon Zolda gave reciprocal</seg><seg type="columnLine">service to that world, so that in time there was scarcely any</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference to be noted between the two races, and an Earthling</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling to the beautiful planet found life almost identical with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of his own world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was now thought that the time was ripe for an Earthly</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition to descend upon Mars, to learn whether its people</seg><seg type="columnLine">were receptive to any visitors.

At a point mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way between Europe and North America, an artificial island</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was constructed. Working on the floor or the ocean, the engi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neers removed the tons of soil and debris that had settled there</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the ages, until they came to bed-rock. There they laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foundation for the most wonderful structure on earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The island, three miles long, and equally wide, a solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of concrete and huge duralumin girders, was built in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of a five-pointed star. The indentations between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">points were intended for use as harbors. Oue portion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island was set aside as a landing field and refueling station</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the transoceanic planes and dirigibles. Another portion</seg><seg type="columnLine">became the site of a rather large group of houses, the intended</seg><seg type="columnLine">homes of the representatives of the world. There were various</seg><seg type="columnLine">other points of interest about the island that are too trivial to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mention, inasmuch as they have no bearing on this record.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The really important feature of the island, and the reason for</seg><seg type="columnLine">its construction, was the huge edifice in its center. This build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, almost two thousand feet high, and covering a space larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a city block, was constructed of great granite cubes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillars. It was designed and built by the cooperating nations</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world as the home of the new International Government.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Its site, an artificial island in the middle of the Atlantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ocean, was chosen in preference to any other suggested locality,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order to avoid showing partiality to any single country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The island and the Union Hall--as the government building</seg><seg type="columnLine">was called--were completed on April 6, 1968. Two weeks later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on April 20, the second World Conference was called at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Capitol, at Washington, D. C.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> President Harwood of the United States presided. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">the preliminary formalities had been dealt with, they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the real purpose of the meeting. Harwood, tall, domineer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, businesslike, arose and surveyed the assemblage before lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen," he said, "when we, the Chief Executives of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, ga/hered for this meeting, we had a definite purpose in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. We desired to learn whether or not our decision to unite</seg><seg type="columnLine">still met with the unanimous approval that greeted it at our</seg><seg type="columnLine">first conference. Perhaps some of us have come to the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusion, during the last year that, after all, we should not unite.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If there are those who have so decided, we will hear from them</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The President remained standing, his eyes resting on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men before him. An air of tense expectancy hung over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. For almost a minute no one spoke. When it was cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain that no one intended speaking, Harwood broke the silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Since there appears to be no objection," he began, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped short. He was interrupted in a most unexpected, most</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounding manner. A great, roaring voice, whose thunderous</seg><seg type="columnLine">volume shook the building, and set the executives' ears ringing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to come from the ceiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But there is objection," the voice thundered. "I object most</seg><seg type="columnLine">strenuously! This folly must stop! I warn you, if this meet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing is not adjourned, and you men are not on board trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oceanic liners headed for your respective countries within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next twenty-four hours, the entire world will regret it! This</seg><seg type="columnLine">union will not take place; there will never be ail International</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government! That is my warning; obey--or take the conse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quences. Remember, twenty-four hours.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE voice ceased as abruptly as it had begun. A heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence fell upon the assemblage. Men stared at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbors, stark amazement in their eyes. What they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard was absolutely incredible, but the ringing in their ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">testified to the truth of the impossible. Eyes that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing upward, lowered; the blank, unresponsive ceiling was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that they had seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment President Harwood was at a loss for words.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His face was pale, and his voice trembled when he finally spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen," he said, "we are confronted by an utterly inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicable occurrence. We can't explain it, but we can be sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one tiling. Either this room contained someone who shouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE INVISIBLE DESTROYER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1007</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have been here, and who is opposed to our views; or a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">amplifier is concealed somewhere. Both thoughts arc pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posterous, yet, one or the other must be so. In either case,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, the best thing that we can do, is to adjourn this meet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing until tomorrow, and have the building searched immediately.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Obviously, we cannot consider obeying the ridiculous commands</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we rcccivcd; we'll gather here tomorrow at this time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later they filed from the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within two hours, the entire world knew about the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its threat. An enterprising newspaper reporter had learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">something about the affair, and President Harwood, when ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned, had decided to tell the facts as they occurred, in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prevent distorted and inaccurate accounts from being pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lished. International Radio News had received the facts from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the press, and the entire story was given world-wide publicity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Within two hours it was the chief topid of conversation all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the story came over the radio, Vachell and I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated in the living room of his apartments, a few squares</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Capitol, "listening in." The strange happenings in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the International assembly aroused our immediate interest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When Vachell suggested that we visit President Harwood, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he was well acquainted, I readily assented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were about to leave, when the telephone bell rang. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">President wished to speak with Vachell. After a few moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of conversation, the latter hung up the receiver. "The Presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent wishes to see me at the White House," he said, and smiled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are welcome to go along if you wish," he added. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to go; a few moments later we started up the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the Executive Mansion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">An Exhibition of Power</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PRESIDENT HARWOOD greeted us cordially as we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ushered into his presence. After I had been introduced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he motioned us into chairs, and without preamble began</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking about the subject that was uppermost in the mind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I understand," he began, "that you are familiar, in a general</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, with the events that broke up the International Congress</seg><seg type="columnLine">this afternoon," We nodded. "Still, to be certain that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the facts straight, it will do no harm to repeat them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rapidly, then, he reviewed the events of the International</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conference, outlining briefly that which I have recorded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater detail. When he had finished, he continued:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Using that as a basis for our consideration, at what con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusion can we arrive? With what have we to deal? Is it</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work of an individual, a faction, or a dissatisfied nation?</seg><seg type="columnLine">So far as I can see, we have no way of determining. What is</seg><seg type="columnLine">your opinion, Leo?" he asked of the scientist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vachell hesitated before replying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he said finally, "in my opinion, it's the work of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual, or, what is more likely, a group. There's little</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of a nation being back of it; I don't believe that any</seg><seg type="columnLine">government would risk antagonizing every other country on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, and certainly no nation would adopt the method that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this--voice is using. By the way, what was your reason for</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking the action you did after you had heard the threat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voice?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harwood smiled quizzically. "Frankly, I don't know. Prompt</seg><seg type="columnLine">action was necessary; and I said the first thing that came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind. In reality, I don't believe that the warning came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from someone concealed in the room; the voice had a metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality, indicative of an amplifier. Still, it's more probable</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a man was concealed in the room, than a big loudspeaker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet how could a man have spoken with such enormous volume,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without mechanical aid? And, whether it was a man, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine, or both, how on earth was it able to talk from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That ceiling, the entire room, and every part of the building</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, have been carefully searched, and nothing unusual has</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">come to light. The fact of the matter is this: it's absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexplicable, and entirely out of reason." And Harwood ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured helplessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For more than an hour the President and Vachell discussed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the problem, while I was an interested spectator. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">actual result of the discussion was their decision to have Vachell</seg><seg type="columnLine">and myself present at the conference on the following day. 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose I was included for the sake of courtesy rather than for</seg><seg type="columnLine">any assistance I might lend, but I wasn't greatly concerned</seg><seg type="columnLine">about that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A short time later, Vachell and I left the White House, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed toward our apartments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">APPROXIMATELY twenty-four hours after leaving Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">, wood, we retraced our steps to the Capitol. When we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were about two hundred feet away from the building, a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">accosted us and asked what business we had in the neighbor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood. Vachell explained briefly, and the Secret Service man--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for such he was--permitted us to pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we were about to ascend the steps of the Capitol we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped again, this time by an armed guard. At that opportune</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, a number of closed cars drew up to the curb, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's chief executives alighted. As Harwood greeted Vachell</seg><seg type="columnLine">and me, the guard withdrew, and we followed the government</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaders into the building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some time later when Vachell asked Harwood about the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who questioned us, the President explained that the Capitol</seg><seg type="columnLine">was completely surrounded by armed guards and Secret Service</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, and that army planes, circling overhead were intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent any possible attack from the air. Although there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">little likelihood of the threat of the voice being carried out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had said, they had decided to take no unnecessary chances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A strained tension seemed to rest upon the air as Harwood</seg><seg type="columnLine">called the assembly to order. A feeling of expectancy, tinged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with apprehension, made itself known to every man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the meeting progressed, uninterrupted, the tension relaxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to some extent, and we began to feel more at ease. Evidently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we thought, the voice would not make itself heard in this meet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ; the guards had kept it or him away. Nevertheless, I began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to feel rather disappointed; it seemed that I wouldn't eperience</seg><seg type="columnLine">the excitement I had expected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were safely past the point in the meeting where it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been interrupted the day before, no objection having been raised,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were about to adjourn, when a faint purple glow crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the room. Harwood, who had been speaking, became</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent A deathlike stillness fell upon us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, with a roar that set our eardrums ringing, a great,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirthless, sardonic laugh split the silence. As on the previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon, the voice seemed to come from the ceiling. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, with disconcerting abruptness, the laughter ceased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then mighty, thunderous words crashed upon us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How droll, how very funny! Fools with the minds of chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren, and you imagined that mere armed guards would keep me</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this room! You, in your abject helplessness, attempted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to control me!" A roaring volley of laughter rolled over us</seg><seg type="columnLine">again; it ended as abruptly as before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no suggestion of mirth in the giant voice when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke a second time; it was cold, stern, angry. "You saw fit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to defy me, to disobey my commands! I warned you, but my</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning went unheeded! You'll have to take the consequences!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then its tones became more lenient, thoughtful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Still, I may be expecting too much.

Before us, on the wide platform sat the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presidents of the United States, England, France and Germany,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world's greatest executives. Behind us, occupying several</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows of seats, were the representatives of all nations. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, only a small chamber off the main auditorium, was nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled.	_</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Because of Hie threat of Demetriovich, tliat roomful of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the only beings on the island. It had been decided that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prevent any possible interference of the Russian, they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the only ones allowed to land. After the signing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Declaration of World Union, they intended permitting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing of the great host of planes of all descriptions that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered around the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Every precaution had been taken to insure the meeting against</seg><seg type="columnLine">interruption. A fleet of armored vessels surrounded the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Union Star, and airplanes, like a swarm of bees, circled through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air above the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, the little gathering in the Union Hall was rather un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy.

We had hardly taken our places, when an</seg><seg type="columnLine">interruption came.

Poised high above the center of the Union</seg><seg type="columnLine">Building, and consequently above the exact center of the island,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it pointed its base directly toward the earth. And from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">base streamed a pulsing, flickering pillar of blue radiance!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Upon this, the cone seemed to be resting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A MOMENT after we had emerged from the building, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice had spoken again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I warned you that, if my commands went unheeded, you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">regret itl You've deliberately ignored everything I've said, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll have to take the consequences I I--'' A shot rang out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one of the armed vessels, and the shell leaped toward its</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark. And exploded about fifty feet from the cone! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have struck a wall of some invisible force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment, two airplanes left the main group of ships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swooped down toward the cone in an evident attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck it, though they sacrified their lives in the attempt. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shell, they crashed into that invisible barrier, seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rebound, and fell into the sea. twin masses of flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The voice laughed sardonically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you'd try to injure me with your feeble weapo&gt;is! How</seg><seg type="columnLine">droll!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The cone tiled at a sharp angle, and a beam of dazzling, white</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiance replaced the pillar of blue. It darted toward the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which the shot had come, and bathed it in its brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. The vessel seemed to start under the impact; then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, gradually, it grew transparent, wraithlike, and--</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps you will realise now, how utterly helpless you are!</seg><seg type="columnLine">But enough oj this nonsense! You must reap the reward of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your folly I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cone, again in an upright position, began whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly. A circular flood of white light, similar in appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that which had destroyed the ship, leaped from the base of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cone, and, like an inverted funnel, spread over the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A pleasant tingling pervaded my being at my first contact</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the rays. But as those rays increased in intensity, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tingling lost its pleasantness, and became a nerve-racking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscle-twisting torture. Finally, when I thought I had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limit of human endurance, there was a sudden--snap--as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though my spirit-had broken the cords that had bound it to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly shell, the white ray vanished, and I was myself again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Demetriovich Again!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	GLANCED at Vachell. His face, turned toward the ocean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had an incredulous expression upon it. I followed his gaze--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gasped in amazement. The ships, yachts and seaplanes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dotted the harbors were gone--vanished. Then too I</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that the airplanes that had been circling above us, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">likewise disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were alone on the open seal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A sharp exclamation from Vachell caused me to glance up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. The cone was descending! It came to rest about five</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet above us, and a little to the left, still supported by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue pillar. Then a section of the seemingly solid wall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cone slid aside, and the figure of Demetriovich appeared at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening. He stood there for a moment, looking down at us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he stepped off into the air. Twin pillars of blue radiance</seg><seg type="columnLine">streamed from the soles of his shoes, and he floated gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As Demetriovich noted the expressions of amazement that</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been on our faces, he chuckled drily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You've seen some things that are rather surprising, haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you ?" he asked. "Yet what you've seen is only a small fraction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what I am capable of doing." He spoke in a casual, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versational tone that was decidedly annoying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Up to this time we had been silent and motionless. But now</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vachell stepped forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, Alex," he said boldly, "you seem to have become</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of • a dictator recently.

"Nothing--except this!" He thrust his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a belt that encircled his waist, and drew therefrom, a small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal, shining cone. He pointed the base at us, and pressed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">button; and in a moment we were firmly rooted to the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were as helpless as we had been in the Capitol at Wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I think that's enough to interfere with your capturing me I"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Russian exclaimed. And, so far as my 'childish tricks' are</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned, I can soon convince you that what I've done is quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit more than that. There's no reason why I should tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, but at the same time, it can do no harm, for you're power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less to interfere with my plans.

Yet it would still be there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Under the latter condition, wouldn't it be possible to place</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in the path of the propeller, perhaps even walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it, unscathed?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At any rate, this is what I'm trying to impress upon you:</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is possible by accelerated vibration to throw something into</seg><seg type="columnLine">an entirely new dimension.

Understand, the possibility is very remote, but it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth considering. So, I suggest that we first of all learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether or not we're still where we should be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> President Harwood arose. "That's an excellent suggestion,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he smiled, "but I can't sec how it can be followed out.

"If it was Demctriovich's intention to keep us here, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">has slipped up. for there's a three-passenger plane in one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hangars. I happen to know it's there, because Taylor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I visited the island with it two days ago, and left it here, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning to the United States on one of the transoceanic liners.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE INVISIBLE DESTROYER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1011</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I propose that you, Harwood, and Taylor and I take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane and fly to the North American continent.

If, as Demetriovich said, he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken us to a lifeless world, we had better find out at once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if we're still on our own plane, we had better get help</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately. In any case, the first thing to do is to learn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cxact condition of things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER a rather lengthy discussion, the officials and scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">. tists agreed to Vachell'* plan, and we proceeded toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the airplane hangars. I was included as one of the three, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause I was an expert pilot, having served three years in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">International Air Patrol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plane, a small, Wenger-helicoptcr type, a very late model</seg><seg type="columnLine">with four motors, we filled with gas, and loaded with provisions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and water. After seeing that everything was in perfect con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition, we rolled it out of the hangar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, all was ready, and Harwood, Vachell and I stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the machine. The motors were started, and the helicopter</seg><seg type="columnLine">propellers lifted the plane high into the air. Straightening out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we started across the ocean with constantly accelerating speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a few moments the Union Island had dwindled to a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">star; then it was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only one thing worthy of note occurred during the five un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventful hours of the trip across the ocean. About midway</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the island and our destination, we saw what seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a flashing, silver meteor darting across the sky. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving in the same direction that we were, or we would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen it; as it was, it soon outdistanced us and was lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of _one thing we felt sure: that flashing object, whatever it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be, was not of our world. Our hearts sank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, we arrived at our destination. I had pointed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose of the plane toward what, under normal conditions, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been New York Gty. But these were anything but nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal conditions, for instead of the familiar skyline of sky-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrapers, we saw a vast expanse of white, translucent glass. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as the eye could reach, south, west and north, that monoto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nous, level sheet of glass continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our own world? Obviously, it wasn't. But, as Vachell</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out, neither was it a desert world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps Demetriovich made a mistake," the scientist sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested, "and took us too far along the vibratory scale, or not</seg><seg type="columnLine">far enough, to answer his purpose. If, as he said, there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless worlds existing on the surface of the earth, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could easily be possible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That, in all probability, is what occurred. The Russian had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a mistake!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hour after hour, we continued flying, searching for an open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the continent's roof. That there was such an opening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were certain, for, we reasoned, the projectile we had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying in this direction must have gone through the glass some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where. It certainly hadn't remained on the surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last we saw that for which we were searching. Some dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance ahead, over what must have corresponded with our Mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sissippi Valley, there was a great, circular, well-like opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the glass, fully a mile in diameter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A New World!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN a moment the plane had flashed over the glass to the open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. My haste almost proved to be our undoing. As we</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew out over the opening, a great, gleaming projectile, scream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing shrilly, so great was its velocity, flashed almost straight up</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plane took a terrifying dip, turning end over end. Caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a whirling vortex of air that resulted from the projectile's</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight, we pitched and spun like a leaf in a gale. That we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not cast to the bottom of the shaft, a broken wreck, is no credit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, for I had completely lost control of the machine. How-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, we escaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were close to the bottom of the shaft when I righted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane; a moment later, I brought it to earth. With hearts beat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing more rapidly, we left the machine and stared around. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of creatures or things might we see?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not for long did we wonder. An oval doorway in the nearby</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass wall of the shaft slid back, and a strange little creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared. In a general way he looked like a man, but such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man I He was only about four feet tall, and painfully thin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that apparently emaciated, undernourished body supported</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge, hairless head that was more than twice the size of mine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The features of his face were even, regular, built on the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">scale as his head, but any niccness that his face might have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">was destroyed by his lack of teeth. Apparently, he hadn't a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tooth in his mouth; his lips were drawn in over his gums like</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of a toothless hag. When we first saw him, he had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression of consternation and unbelief on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, old top," Vachell exclaimed facetiously, "this is an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpected pleasure. We are very glad to see you; we hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">you feel the same toward us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the little man replied! Although no words passed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips, we received the distinct impression that he had given a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental answer. Somewhat harshly, it seemed, he had asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">us what we wanted, and from whence we had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ignoring the means of communication this big-headed being</seg><seg type="columnLine">had employed, Vachell explained. "You see, it's this way,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "we've been brought to this world against our wills,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we wish to return to our own vibratory plane. It is our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope that your world can aid us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought Vachell had taken leave of his senses when I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">his explanation. What would this creature know about vibra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory worlds I But strangely, the big-head seemed to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand. He nodded. Then the silent communication came:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Follow me I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bending low in order to escape contact with the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little opening, we followed the strange being into his glass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roofed world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN I try to describe the wonders of that astounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, I realize the utter futility of words. Or, perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stupendous things we saw were beyond my powers of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehension. Be that as it may, according to all appearances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had come into a world that was fully fifteen thousand years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of our own in progress. Indeed, by comparison with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings of that world, we were about as low on the scale of</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolution as the pygmies of Australia are when compared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Glass, white, translucent glass, was everywhere. We learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">later that the entire North American continent was one huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass house, and that all people lived, and all industry took</seg><seg type="columnLine">place under one roof. There were no streets as we know them;</seg><seg type="columnLine">great lifts and overland cars, propelled by a type of vibratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">force, connected all parts of the land. And everywhere were</seg><seg type="columnLine">those disproportionate figures, scurrying here and there like so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many busy little ants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We followed our host or captor, whichever he was, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throng of big-hcads that had gathered around us, into one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the numerous lifts. With breath-taking speed we were borne</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward. When the elevator came to a halt, we left it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved along a glass hall past rows of oval doorways. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were exactly alike, with nothing to identify them so far as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little big-head seemed to know his destination, though,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he paused before one of the ovals, and pressing a little but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, led us through the doorway into the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This seemed to be some sort of work-room, for it was filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with intricate machinery, and, to us, utterly meaningless de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vices. What the purpose of it all was, we never learned. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, by the way, was constructed of the same white glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our guide stopped to confer with one of the workers for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">1012</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">moment--at least I suppose inaudible communication passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them--tlien lie continued on across the room. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">far side, we passed through another oval, and stood within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room that was our destination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This room was entirely different from any we saw during</seg><seg type="columnLine">our stay in that vibratory world. Its walls were a dull, opaqu?</seg><seg type="columnLine">black; yet, paradoxically, from them seemed to come a strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">opalescent radiance. The room was bare, devoid of any furni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture except for a small platform in the center, upon which stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">two small, short-legged stools. Between the stools was a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">intricate and complex device, from which wires led to one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Strange Experience</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS the big-head commanded Vachell to be seated on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stools, the latter eyed the strange device between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them rather dubiously. "What'll it do--whatever your name</seg><seg type="columnLine">is?" he asked hesitantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a device for visual thought transference," came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental reply, which all of us caught "It will do you no liarm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have no name; I am known by my number, 28L37426X9108A-</seg><seg type="columnLine">27." And again came the command for Vachell to sit on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the scientist had mounted the platform and seated him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, 28L--as we thought of the big-head after that--placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange glass hood over Vachell's head and eyes, and a similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">device on his own huge cranium, and settled back on his stool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shall never know, except in a general way, what thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed between those two minds. Vachell, some time later, out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined briefly what had been asked of him, and the answers he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given. It is from that outline that I have my information.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the two were seated, Vachell was directed to form a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental picture of all that had happened in connection with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming to that world. He began at the beginning, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">week the four of us had spent in the hills, and, step by step,</seg><seg type="columnLine">went through the entire story up to our arrival in the glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. When he had finished, he pictured the world in a state</seg><seg type="columnLine">of chaos and devastation as the result of Demctriovich's assump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of authority, and his subsequent mismanagement of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nations. And finally, he made a plea for aid in returning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our vibratory plane, and fighting against the Russian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vachell, after a few moments of waiting, received a thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture of himself making his plea before a strange, monstrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature who seemed to be nothing but head. So far as Vachell</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see, the creature consisted of a great, fleshy, spheroidal</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass, covered by a dead-white membrane, unbroken save for</seg><seg type="columnLine">two huge, lidless eyes near the top, and a small, red orifice</seg><seg type="columnLine">at its base. The thought was repeated; then 28L raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal cap, and bade Vachell do likewise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the big-head's direction, then, the three of us seated our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves on the platform that he and Vachell had just quitted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing the wall that was connected with the thought-transfer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence device. Suddenly the room was plunged into darkness, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls no longer emitting their opalescent light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we sat there watching, waiting, we heard--no, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensed, a vast, roaring, rushing sound, a somehow orderly</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaos, as though all vibrations of every octave were loosed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once--concentrated--hurling themselves through our minds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, from the black wall before us streamed a brilliant radi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, flecked with minute, darting lights. In some unnatural</seg><seg type="columnLine">way it seemed to pass through us, as light-streams through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">window pane--as though we were transparent!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN slowly, but with ever increasing rapidity, we began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move forward! The wall opened up before us into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-flooded, unthinkably vast tunnel. Along this tunnel we</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved, swept on by that cosmic hurricane of sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But were we moving ? I cannot say. Paradoxically, I seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be seated on that platform in the room--and yet, seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be moving miles and miles out through that tunnel of sound,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that tumult of vibration. I hesitate to record this, but--1</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained the distinct impression that I was at one and the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, seated in the room, and yet was--stretchcd--through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles of the tunnel's space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually the tempestuous roaring lost some of its force;</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly it abated, and--died. And our own movement through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel ceased. Then, as never before, I was conscious of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that utter annihilation of distance, that inexplicable projection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of myself across the miles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tunnel had ended in a great, dome-ceilingcd chamber.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the center of the chamber, floating stationary in midair, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cloud of mist. As we entered the room, the mist, swirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and twisting, drew aside, revealing the white-skinned, bodylcss</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain-being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we stared at the amazing spectacle in awe, we somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that we were in the presence of infinite wisdom, of un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralleled knowledge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God!" exclaimed Harwood.in a hushed whisper, for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time breaking the silence. "Can all this be--" The whisper</seg><seg type="columnLine">died on his lips as the mist that had surrounded the brain-being</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted down and encircled us. It seemed to gather around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and congeal upon Vachell; arose, then, with the scientist in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its grasp, and swept up toward the entity from which it liad</seg><seg type="columnLine">come; bore him, or the strange projection of him--for he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still beside me in the black room--entirely enveloped by itself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, up, until he was face to face with the super-intelligence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that vibratory world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Vachell described it later, he experienced a singular</seg><seg type="columnLine">draining sensation, as though all knowledge, all power of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought was being drawn from him. This endured for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment; then Vachell was replaced at our side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Back to Their World</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE returned to the room by tbe same path over which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had come. We seemed to remain stationary, shrink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing while the tunnel whirled past us. And finally, that unnatural</seg><seg type="columnLine">extension of each of us was no more; and we were back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lightless room, facing the blank, black wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I cleared my throat to speak; heard Harwood stirring rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly; Vachell laid silencing liands on our shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not yet, Taylor, Harwood," he murmured. "More to fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tensely we waited, scarcely breathing. Then a dim, lumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nous haze appeared where the tunnel had been. That haze</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew--resolved itself into an image of the brain-being. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture dimmed for a moment vague, formless; then, in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">place we saw--ourselves, each surrounded by a colorless cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">of misty light! Behind us, less distinctly outlined, were those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had remained on the island, similarly surrouned by nebu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lous clouds of radiance. In the hand of each of us was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched a long, slender, metal rod with a white glass ball at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then we saw Demctriovich's cone sweeping down, a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibratory ray darting toward us. The ray, striking the clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">that surrounded us, was either deflected or nullified, for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplished nothing. And then, from the balls on our slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods flashed beams of almost invisible force. They came in</seg><seg type="columnLine">contact with the £one, and burned through and through it. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed to the earth, riddled with holes, a useless wreck. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the image vanished; and in a moment the room was again</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooded with light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 28L gave mental expression to his approval as he led us</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the room. When we were alone in the quarters that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big-head assigned to us, we likewise gave expression to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction and joy, but in a far more demonstrative manner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Russian and his works would be destroyed, and the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be saved! Not once did it occur to us to doubt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability of these creatures to do what they promised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harwood had taken little part in our rejoicing. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vachell questioned him about this, he replied:</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE INVISIBLE DESTROYER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1013</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'm in a sort of daze, that's all. The utterly astounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">things that have occurred since we've come here, have thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a little off balance." He smiled ruefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Harwood," Vachell counseled earnestly, "don't let these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things affect you. I know, even better than you, how incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are; they contradict all known laws of science. I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain what occurred, so I do not try. And I've seen things</seg><seg type="columnLine">that neither of you are aware of."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I SHALL record little of what took place during the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks that followed, while, for some unaccountable reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">we heard no more about our return to our own world. 28L,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who, by the way, was one of the most important individuals</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their world, conducted us, by means of the tunnel of sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to some of the most interesting spots on the continent. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">trips, and the countless mechanical and architectural marvels</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw, have been recorded in detail in the joint work of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vachell, Harwood and myself, "The World of Another Octave."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At last those three weeks of impatient waiting passed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one morning shortly after we had arisen, 28L came to us with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the news that we were to return to the island that day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Impatiently we followed him through a labyrinth of passages</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lifts to the well-like opening in the glass roof. As we</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed through the oval door into the open air, we saw a long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparatively slender cylinder, constructed of the same white</seg><seg type="columnLine">material as everything else in that strange land. A series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">oval doors ran along one side of the machine; 28L led us</seg><seg type="columnLine">through one of these.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I make no attempt to give more than a general description</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wonders we saw in that white projectile. Their amaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly complex nature gave them an air of unreality. Tower-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing masses of whirling machinery--great, spinning fly-wheels--</seg><seg type="columnLine">devices whose strangeness beggars description--the vehicle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with these.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the center of the floor of the projectile, running its entire</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">length? was a yard-wide strip of pale blue glass. 28L bade us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stand on this, mentally explaining that it was the machine's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">center of gravity, keeping us fast to the floor regardless of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what position the projectile assumed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When we had followed his directions, and were standing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strip of blue, which held our feet in a vise-like grip, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a sudden lurch, a breath-taking burst of speed, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectile settled down to an even, forward motion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Our flight by plane from the island to the opening in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass had taken eight hours; the return in the projectile was</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplished in little more than one. We did not know our</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey had ended until 28L opened one of the doors, and indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated that we should step out, for we had no way of determining</seg><seg type="columnLine">how fast we had been traveling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Just before we left the vehicle, two big-heads came forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the metal rods that would be our weapons, and the glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">bands that were to form our ray-repelling auras. After we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had divided them among ourselves, Vachell addressed 28L.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Is the cylinder going back with us?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No," came the silent reply. "Our bodies are too frail to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear the strain of the journey. All of us who have attempted</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, have failed to return. And now, if you'll leave--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A moment later we stood outside the projectile; the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">was closed; and the great, white cylinder rose into the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Standing among the world executives and scientists who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered around us with words of greeting and inquiry on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips, we followed the projectile's flight with our eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It shot straight up into the air for about four thousand feet,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then stopped short and hung stationary, its end pointing toward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the island. A moment later a blinding beam of radiance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">streamed from that end, and spread over the Union Star. For</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">i second time we felt that torturing tingling. More and more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unbearable became the vibration of the atoms of our beings--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then there was a sharp snap--and the projectile had vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We had returned safely to our own world I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Strategic Plan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">FOR almost an hour after our return Vachell talked, re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lating all that had transpired since the time we left the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And finally, gentlemen," he concluded, "those men of that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other world, using a method somewhat similar to that of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Demetriovich, sent us back to our own plane."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The scientist was silent for a moment; then, holding one of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the glass bands and slender, metal rods in his hands, he spoke</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Now, gentlemen, before we do anything else, I think we had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">better prepare for our defence. Each of us will place one of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">these bands around his waist, and arm himself with these little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rods, for we don't know when we'll need their protection."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Harwood and I distributed the bands and rods while Vachell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">demonstrated how they were to be used. Then, while the rest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were engaged in placing their bands in position, I inspected</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mine with greater care than I had been able to exercise before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The band, I saw, was a simple affair, slightly oval in shape,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and just large enough to fit snuggly around the average waist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">About four inches high it was, and about half that in thick-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ness. It reminded me of a great, glass wedding ring, with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">its surface smooth and unbroken save for a knob on one side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When this knob was turned, the band began its work, surround-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing its wearer with a protective aura.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A few minutes after the bands had been distributed, we pre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sented a strange appearance. Each of us was standing in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heart of a wraithlike, transparent cloud that extended about six</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inches from all sides of our bodies. We seemed to be radiant,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">glowing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">One of the executives raised the question as to what was to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be done next. In a moment, the members of the group were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">busily discussing what would be the best plan to follow. Some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suggested that we wait for the Russian to make the initial</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">move; others were in favor of sending out a plea for help over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the radio transmitter that was on the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We had debated this question for some minutes without re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sult, when a sudden exclamation from one of the scientists</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">caused us to look around. We followed his pointing finger</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with our eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">High in the eastern sky, we saw a tiny, black speck, rapidly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">growing larger. As we watched, it resolved itself into a small,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one-man helicopter. It was over us; was going past--then it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seemed to hesitate, and in a long, slanting drop, flashed down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">toward the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It landed on the opposite side of the Union Hall. With</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one accord we raced around the huge structure. We turned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a corner, and came face to face with--Kieth I Allen Kieth,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the astronomer who had been the fourth member of our party</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the Alleghenies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">HE greeted us with an expansive smile and an outstretched</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hand.

"You can't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">realize how much the nations have missed you.

With the exception of a score of under-scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tists from the American Institute of Physics whose hands had</seg><seg type="columnLine">built it. Dr. Jorgstedt, and two high government officials, not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul had been given an inkling as to what was taking place</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the walls of a hangar oil the scientist's residential</seg><seg type="columnLine">grounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the moment had arrived for the greatest airship in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world to take off on its maiden flight with a passenger list made</seg><seg type="columnLine">up of a few privileged scientists, government authorities and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of the world's foremost newspaper editors. Throngs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">reporters circulated around it on the ground, snapping pictures</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and left, but none were permitted to enter. Armed guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnished by the government stood ready to halt any person who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not display a pass signed personally by Professor Markle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. Even government officials were no exception to the rule</seg><seg type="columnLine">established by the scientist as a precautionary measure when</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie issued the invitations for the maiden flight.

Looking through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bands one could see the interior of the craft's control room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge and foreward observation decks. At the rear end, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the band, was a comfortable lounging cabin of three transparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">decks. lavishly appointed with large, easy chairs. A row of</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, porthole-like windows lined cither side of the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">polished metal hulk. At her tail, giant stabilizing fins arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the blades of some tremendous windmill. Two sets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">laterals and ailerons of shining metal protruded from the ship's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear, giving one the impression of looking at some great</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream-lined creature of the ocean depths with double tail-fins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a thing of flashing beauty, although, without the cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomary gondolas and gas bags so common in ordinary airships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed bound eternally to earth.

And had the comparatively small</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving exhausts located between every two of the rolling sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bilizers been studied by one skilled in rocket propulsion, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge ship's powers of speed would have immediately become</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprehensible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PROFESSOR MARKLESON'S craft marked the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">step yet attained by physical aviation science.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled 011 a cord and a high-sounding siren shrieked for field</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearance. At once he noticed the armed guards running away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ship's polished sides to take up positions with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camera-men near the walls of the hangar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The passengers, seated upon comfortable, stationary benches</seg><seg type="columnLine">well away from the controls, seemed numbed into quietness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They watched each single movement of the scientist as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands touched the various controls. They watched him pulling</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually upon a throttle scarcely larger than the grip of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's hand. Then they became aware of an increasing drone</seg><seg type="columnLine">surging through the ship's hull. The edges of the central sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the hulk along the transparent band seem to glow with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a purple luminosity. The guest scientists watched it with puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zled interest and the various newspaper editors began jotting</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes upon whatever papers they could find in their pockets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Contrary to popular conception, newspapermen do not carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">notebooks ready for instant use but rely on memory, which under</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary conditions, serves the purpose adequately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were a score of stunned pcsonalities on board the Sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Urchin when it was discovered that the craft had already left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth I Professor Markleson grinned with amusement at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden astonishment on the faces of his guests. He glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">around at them, his eyes aglow with excitement Thus far the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sky Urchin was a success!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Strange Forebodings</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH scarcely a tremor it had risen from its resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">place on the surface.

Now it floated two miles above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field, its nose pointed westward, as steady and rigid as if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay at rest within its hangar. Superb, a thing of glistening</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty, the monster hovered in the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take a look, gentlemen!" Professor Markleson invited.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The field below appears no larger than a square emerald set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting in a man's ring I Rather a pleasant take-off, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blue sky stretched beyond. Below lay the earth, criss-crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with ribbon-like thoroughfares, squared with checkerboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">patches of green and brown, interspersed here and there with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">conical spires that seemed like infinitesimal needle points in</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparison with the vastncss of the visible terrain. The pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers peered in all directions, plainly hypnotized by the sudden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpected rise and the glory of the scenes on all sides. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">realization that here at last was a revolutionary step in aerial</seg><seg type="columnLine">transportation stunned even Professor Markleson himself, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was with keen delight that he listened to the praise that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once heaped upon him by those who appreciated his as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tounding achievements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned presently to the controls and ordered his picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew to various stations within the cabin. The Sky Urchin</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to heel earthward as the propulsion units went into ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, yellow jets of flame spitting rearward from the exhausts</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the stabilizers at the tail. The exhausts began a gradual</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar that soon gave way to a pleasant, lulling hiss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the craft's nose dipped earthward under the recoil of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving exhausts, Professor Markleson swung the aileron con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trols slightly upward by turning a small wheel within a larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. Instantly the Sky Urchin's nose lifted skyward. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers, suddenly tensed by the unexpected plunge, breathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't believe the recoil can be overcome, gentlemen," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist said. "There's bound to be some reaction upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship when the propulsion exhausts arc thrown open.

Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was more gentle than I had anticipated I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great scientists strode over close to the transparent band</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked out. Far below, the terrain was slipping past in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown blur. Scarcely an object was recognizable at the terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity under which the Sky Urchin was speeding through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air before the constant explosions from its propulsion exhausts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The passengers stared at one another, their eyes twinkling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied lights. At last science had conquered gravity and speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well, for the craft had risen by neutralizing and repelling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's gravitational attraction, and here it was, scudding</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the heavens like a projectile hurled from some huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful rifle 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS it raced across the arched dome of blue at an altitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">five miles, the Sky Urchin was subject to scarcely a bump.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The air seemed much smoother here than in the heavier atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere below. As confident as a captain standing at the controls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some great ocean liner, Professor Marklcson watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dials in front of him and smiled as he made occasional readings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of velocity, altitude, gravitational pull, resistance and internal</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen pressure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, somehow, the scientist experienced a vague premonition</seg><seg type="columnLine">of something untoward. What it was he could not define. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt certain that the perfect functioning of the ship would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">cease and thereby crash it to earth. He tried to shake off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling, but try as he might, he could not shun it It was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though a sixth sense warned him that danger lurked near. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a strange sensation of being watched from some invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">source. Yet despite the foreboding that was marring an other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise perfect flight, he smiled and did not allow his anxiety to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach those who depended upon him for their very lives. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced around to read the faces that were arranged within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin. Perhaps here he would find the eyes that penetrated his</seg><seg type="columnLine">being and caused him to shudder inwardly. But no--the faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">were smiling; none were looking at him directly. Each man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was either engaged at jotting notes or conversing softly with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nearest neighbor. The government men were looking out</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the band, and talking earnestly. The five men, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">students of physical aviation and well-known to the scientist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were attending to their own business at their posts. Strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feeling persisted upon him and as the Sky Urchin plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a mass of fleecy clouds, it grew gradually to certainty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Someone was watching him intently, no trying to avoid realiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">1018</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the fact!

He expected something like that, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feel of the blunt nose of the weapon made him try to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head to get a glimpse of its owner. Not a word had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. The scientist had merely heard a sudden scramble of feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the cabin floor and then felt the gun poked into his back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No other sound except one high-pitched chuckle was audible</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the hissing of the Sky Urchin as it shot across the sky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That excitement ran high he could tell by the heavy breathing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the man behind him and the occasional grunt of another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the man behind him spoke with startling suddenness, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a voice that sounded vaguely familiar to Markleson. If he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">but look at the figure of the man who he felt confident was</seg><seg type="columnLine">masked, perhaps he could tell the identity of its owner. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands gripping the controls tightly he found himself won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering what sort of deviltry was going on. With difficulty he</seg><seg type="columnLine">restrained a wild urge to swing around and face the man behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Two things prevented him--the thought of the Sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Urchin hurtling tlirough the air out of control, and the firm</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure of the pistol on his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mighty sorry, professor!" the voice stated, bluntly. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voice startled him! For an instant he thought .he recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and he pondered over it.

His mind was blazing in a wave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">resentment as the indicator told him that the craft's speed had</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminished rapidly until it was barely making headway. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced through the observation band. Far below lay a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">expanse of flat terrain, some far-flung frontier of the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">west. Behind him he heard a sudden scuffle--then a sickening</seg><seg type="columnLine">thud. One of his passengers had probably slumped to the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slugged for attempting to make a break. He shot a sidelong</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance at the government men standing over to his right. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood stiffly, hands raised above their heads. As though nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the ordinary was taking place, the crew stood at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">posts, faces in front of them, fearful of turning around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, professor I" the man behind him said, a mischievous</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckle in his voice. "Just hand over those papers that you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">in your inner pocket. I'll take care of the plans and details of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this ship from now on!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Markleson felt suddenly sick--a nauseating sensa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion surged through his vitals. Had not the control wheel been</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stiff, rigid metal, his grip would have torn it loose from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">mooring. He swayed slightly like a man in a daze and his lips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now tightly drawn and purple, trembled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I--haven't got the plans with me," he said, lying. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sent to my vault this morning 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt the man's eyes boring into his back as the pistol was</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped in a tight, significant grip. Then the raider laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply. It made the scientist wince, for it dawned upon him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a very dear friend had laughed just like that not many</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a mighty poor liar, professor!" the man with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol replied, shoving it more firmly against his back. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist tensed, expecting to feel a bullet plowing through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A GLOVED hand swung over his shoulder and slid between</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jacket lapels. It came forth with a sheaf of soiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers. They crinkled softly as the man's gloved fist closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over them in a firm grip. The raider chuckled humorously and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent close to the scientist's ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thank you, professor, most sincerely for your generosity I"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hissed. Professor Markleson glanced sideways and beheld a</seg><seg type="columnLine">masked face from under which the neatly trimmed point of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray Van Dyke protruded. The scientist stiffened, opened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth to speak, thought better of it and smiled grimly. If the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man actually was Dr. Jorgstedt, the world should never know</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his lips that his friend had degenerated. He glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the earth inductor compass to hide a surge of hot blood that</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooded his face. The Sky Urchin was now hovering over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat, brown terrain, like some great silver mammal suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorn of its power to go on. Its nose was pointing due west</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward a dim outline of distant ranges. The sun, like a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball of boiling metal hung low in a sky that was shot with</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaks of gold-edged clouds. The masked raider, who, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist concluded, was the leader of the gang, spoke again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought a man of your calibre would have better sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to carry his plans with him so loosely. But your laxity is</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite pardonable, due to the excitement, I presume, of taking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship into the air. Perhaps this episode will teach you a lesson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now lower the ship to a landing! You and your friends arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to leave it I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Markleson was at the point of making a hot reply</seg><seg type="columnLine">when suddenly the blunt pistol was jerked from his back. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploded in his ear like a crack of thunder. He heard the thud</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a body striking the floor, and looked at the government men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of them lay in a heap, an automatic clutched in a grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of death. The top of his skull seemed to have been cloven. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">raider's pistol once again nestled snugly into the scientist's back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Self-defense on the last frontier I" he chuckled. Loud guffaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed from the throats of his confederates. "The law of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air is the law of the gun, my dear professor! And the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">belongs to him who takes it I I take it in the name of--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Doctor--" began Professor Markleson. But he changed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind and spoke no name. Instead he said quietly: "I suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">your trip to Mars will be realized now, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The raider's boring eyes seemed to study the back of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head for an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mars ?--Mars ?' the man asked, puzzled. "What in hell</seg><seg type="columnLine">would a man want to do on Mars ? But its a mighty good sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestion, professor I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anyhow, I think you are a dirty cad, my friend I" the scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tist hissed between his teeth as he swung a small lever that</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed the Sky Urchin under a gentle influence of the earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitational pull. It began to descend slowly but steadily. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">masked raider chuckled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've been called worse things than that, professor I" he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtly. "So I take no offense at your mild epithet! I don't like</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill a man in cold blood anyhow. But I advise you not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">interfere with us now or in the future I" He bent his masked</seg><seg type="columnLine">face close to the scientist's ear again and hisssed: "If you do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll blast you from the face of the earth I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it were not for the lives of my friends here," Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Markleson retorted, hotly, "I'd kill the lot of you with a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">twitch of my'fingers I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pistol in his back tensed again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Try it!" the raider invited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Foolhardy Move</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT Professor Markleson had no desire to kill his friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">and himself by throwing the huge Sky Urchin at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercy of the earth's gravitational attraction. Had he felt in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clined to do that, the tremendous weight of tbe ship would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried it to the surface below like a plunging meteor, to crash</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SKY RULER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1019</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in a hopeless mass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you can't understand the controlling order of this ship I"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Markleson argued. "How did you get aboard?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't mislead yourself into thinking that we can't operate</seg><seg type="columnLine">this craft, my dear professor I" The man replied. "We've studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">every inch of her in your own hangar 1 Getting aboard was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as easy as getting into the hangar, despite your commendable</seg><seg type="columnLine">precautions. There's nothing difficult in replacing the guards 1"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then why didn't you take the ship off yourself?" the scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tist asked incredulously. The other laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are just as cautious as you were, professor 1" he replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I calculated that it would be easier to take her in the air and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, a little more interesting from the standpoint of ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you realize where this little--adventure will lead you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, of course 1" admitted the skywayman. "To gold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">riches, power and perhaps a kingdom of my own I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The scientist stiffened, but continued to argue nevertheless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are wrong, my friend 1" he growled. "It will lead you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the gallows! And I'll be the one to see that you do hang!</seg><seg type="columnLine">If necessary, I shall devote the rest of my life to apprehending</seg><seg type="columnLine">you! I will hound you to the death I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I'm afraid you won't live as long as you hope to!" the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raider snorted. "But I'll give you a square chance to forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the Sky Urchin I I have the plans--I have the ship; so</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of being apprehended does not enter my mind. It is cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain that you cannot duplicate this hulk in a hurry I"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps not!" Professor Markleson sneered. "But 111 get</seg><seg type="columnLine">you eventually and I'll live to see you swing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Markleson brought the huge Sky Urchin down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flat terrain as gently as if it were a feather. The ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">was waist high in golden grain that shimmered like a sea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow under soft evening breezes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The raiders, ten in all, headed by a heavy set man of Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jorgstedt's proportions, dressed in black, close-fitting flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">garments, his face hidden behind a black mask, herded the Sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Urchin's passengers to the single exit and forced them to step</seg><seg type="columnLine">out Professor Markleson was the last to go. He walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily in front of the leader himself, still feeling the blunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">muzzle of the automatic in his ribs. He had had an excellent</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity to study the man, absorbing each detail as he saw it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was the gray point of the Van Dyke protruding from</seg><seg type="columnLine">underneath his mask, yet the scientist could not entirely con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vince himself that he had faced his friend, Dr. Jorgstedt. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed it was he, the famous astronomer's mind must suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone berserk from the strain of his profession. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost unthinkable, however, that his old friend could have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so completely transformed into a daring, master crook I</seg><seg type="columnLine">As they neared the exit he made a sudden lunge at the masked</seg><seg type="columnLine">raider. Foolhardy, of course, in the face of almost instant death</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the cver-ready automatic! He swung around with an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectedness that nearly upset the raider. His arm thumped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun hand of the man and sent it upward. With a quick flick</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his hand he tried to pull the mask from his face. Then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunderous crash roared in his ears. A bandit had moved be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side his chief and brought the barrel of an automatic down with</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific force on the hatless skull of the scientist He sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor without a sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Brink of Oblivion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHAT transpired next is hardly worthy of account. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be said that the passengers were so confused and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewildered that they scarcely knew what to do under the cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumstances. They formed a knot around the limp form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Markleson as the Sky Urchin's doors closed and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped away from the earth at a terrific velocity. His head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bathed in his own blood, his features unrecognizable, yet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed after a fashion. A piece of white paper fluttered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands as they began to rub them. A government man picked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it up. glanced over a heavy scrawled message and swore. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">read it again and again as though unable to grasp its ominous</seg><seg type="columnLine">significance. There was no doubt that it had been inserted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clutching fingers of the scientist by the raider leader him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. Calling to his companions, the official read the message</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOTICE I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I, the Sky Ruler, hereby claim the air as my ow&gt;i domain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Until now the air has belonged lo no man and no law has</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> been established to proclaim it a possession of any nation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I therefore claim it as my ozvn dominion, and am prepared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to defend it at all costsl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                            (signed) The Sky Ruler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Within three hours the great presses of the world were rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">off newspaper extras by the millions. Wires hummed with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">news of the daring coup of this desperate unknown man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had set himself up as the ruler of the blue, and the excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">world sat back fearfully and speculated upon the outcome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the world read the sensational newspaper accounts</seg><seg type="columnLine">given to it by the Sky Urchin's erstwhile passengers, and talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the possibility of an aerial dominion, a corps of the nation's</seg><seg type="columnLine">best physicians were struggling to save Professor Markleson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was suffering with a fractured skull. He lay in a hospital</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Kansas City, where his life hung in the balance for days.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Physicians and nurses worked over him feverishly, well know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the importance of this man in the world of science. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced age was against him, but some great reserve of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength seemed to carry him through, while surgeons re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved the fragments of splintered bone that were making pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure upon his brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile the Sky Urchin had vanished into thin air. Not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace of it had been discovered. As though the great monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the' upper reaches had flown far out into the vast emptiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of space that is the universe, it disappeared. Powerful telescopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutinized the heavens, the aerial police ceaselessly searched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air--all without success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR many days Professor Markleson hovered on the verge</seg><seg type="columnLine">oi death. And during all this time the whereabouts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sky Urchin remained a mystery. Whether it liad fallen under</seg><seg type="columnLine">control of unknowing hands in sonic isolated place on the far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung fringes of civilization the world had no way of determin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Then suddenly, out of a clear sky, the silvered monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared over Washington at an altitude tliat made her com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely inaccessible to man and his air-screwed craft. Huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">flocks of government planes took off at once, only to return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, their screws useless in the rarefied air of the higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">levels, their pilots exhausted and numbed from cold and lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of oxygen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great ship hung in the higher reaches like a bar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistening platinum. From the ground it appeared no larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a full-sized cigar, yet it seemed a thing of ominous intent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even the president stood upon the White House balcony and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed at it through powerful glasses, wondering what manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of man it was who had proclaimed himself the Sky Ruler. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was soon, however, to learn something about the man's inten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions if not of the man himself. For even as he watched he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a tiny missile suddenly detacli itself from the huge air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft. It came hurtling earthward like a bomb, in a straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">line. Before the president could realize what was happening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the missile hit scarcely a hundred yards away in the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the park across the avenue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When it failed to explode a half dozen army officers raced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and tugged it out of the ground.

The President vanished from the gallery to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">council with the Secretary of War and other department ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecutives. The army officers delivered the paper at once and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood away at attention. The Secretary of War opened it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed it over to the President. The Chief Executive's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">reddened as he read to himself a bold, daring message that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sky Ruler had sent to him.

When Professor Markleson</seg><seg type="columnLine">was finally able to be visited, it was found that his memory was</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely gone I Of the Sky Urchin, he knew nothing, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me oddly when the ship was mentioned. To him the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as meaningless as something spoken in an alien tongue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he was addressed respectfully as Professor by govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment officials, he stared around the room blankly as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to discover an invisible personage. His was a hopeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, and the officials left him with consternation plainly written</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their downcast features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swiftly another monthly toll day approached the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States. Behind locked and guarded doors the President's Cabi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">net held consultation with the War Department. What trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pired behind those locked-doors was not known until the toll</seg><seg type="columnLine">day arrived. Then the government sent up to the waiting Sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruler a blimp that carried nothing but a small piece of white</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper in a steel-bound chest At the same time the air was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive with all types of air craft flying at low altitudes. Govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment ships remained on the ground within hangars, but their</seg><seg type="columnLine">crews were spinning and singing with desire to have the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining blocks removed from under the landing gear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whether the Sky Ruler suspected a trap when he read the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contents on the strip of paper was not known. It told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly in good old Yankee parlance to "go to hell I" And it</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have ruffled his pride, for the Sky Urchin was immediate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly seen to dive headlong toward the earth under the controlled</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces of its gravity repellants and rockets. As though its</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilots were in a hot rage, the ship plunged down into the lanes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of air travel and began at once to rake all scurrying craft with</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosives from some strange-looking gun batteries. Several</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge lighter-than-air passenger liners plunged out of the air at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once and spewed death and destruction on the ground below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN suddenly the challenge was met as five hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">army pursuit planes were hauled out of their hangars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in perfect formation shot into the skies like birds of prey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caught in the lower air levels, the Sky Urchin seemed helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SKY RULER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">against the sudden onslaught from below. One single anti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aircrift gun roared and a shell smashed high above the silvered</seg><seg type="columnLine">hulk. Then the big gun silenecd, fearful lest its missiles take</seg><seg type="columnLine">harvest in the government planes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a swarm of flies attacking an eagle, the army planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung straight for the hovering hulk, machine guns spitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rattling, but sending slugs that were wholly ineffectual</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the thick metal of the Sky Urchin's hull. The Sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruler aimed his guns and raked the ranks of his attackers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seven planes hurtled earthward in flames, but the fighting spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the American pilots kept the others in the hopeless fray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently, as though tiring of sending the whirling planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in flames, the Sky Urchin heeled and swung away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth in a graceful half-turn that would have torn to shreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">any air-liner less rigid. The buzzing planes continued after</seg><seg type="columnLine">her but were outdistanced almost at once. Ten miles up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge monster hovered and dropped a missile into a Washington</seg><seg type="columnLine">square. The United States was given one more chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet the obligation. Without waiting for a reply, yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames shot from the stern of the Sky Urchin, and under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure of its driving exhausts it shot across the skies like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a comet, vanishing in the distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Around the world went the Sky Urchin, visiting every na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of any importance on the globe. From what was cabled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States learned that .every nation had met the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mands without a single attempt to destroy the daring ruler of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skies. A Sky Ruler he was indeed I For one man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one great ship to be able to stand off and dictate to the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beyond a doubt the most daring piece of piracy civilization</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever known. Word leaked to America from Russia that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship had landed there to take on supplies, as it had on two</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasions landed at the Dunmar Chemical Works in New Jer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sey to fake on fuel. The raiders had even gone so far as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">order the factory to prepare a great store of fuel, and had paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it in advance. Company officials refused to disclose where</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was to be delivered, fearing that the leakage would be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected and the entire plant blown to destruction by the Sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruler for revenge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Sudden Recognition</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SUCH was the state of affairs when one day a serious-faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man walked up the spotless white steps in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Capitol and demanded an interview with the Secretary of</seg><seg type="columnLine">War. For more than an hour he waited until finally his im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience was getting the best of him and he got up and renewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his demands, stating that his mission was one of great impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance to the world, and that if the Secretary did not wish to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he would at once set sail for England. Needless to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was admitted at once, and that he stared at the official</seg><seg type="columnLine">with open contempt when he beheld him sitting in an easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair in his sanctum nochalantly smoking an aromatic cigar, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though his mind was free from the trying cares of the nation's</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am Jack Reeves, who acted as superintendent for Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Markleson during the construction of the Sky Urchin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir I" he introduced himself with little formality.

Many old acquaintances were brought before him, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">while his eyes would seem to brighten occasionally at sight of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some friend, recognition refused to assert itself in his stunned,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deadened mind. Friends had beguiled him to visit his old</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">haunts in the hope that the sight of these would restore his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">memory. On this particular day he had been taken to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lounging room of the Scientists' Club, where for hours he sat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a big loose chair, while doctors stood about hoping he would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">recognize the appointments in the room with which he had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">once been very familiar. He stared curiously at familiar faces,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but for the life of him he could not recall ever having known</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a single one of them. There was not a man in that room who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was not appraised by the blank eyes of the famous scientist, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">many of those present could boast of knowing him intimately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Presently another familiar face and figure came into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lounge from the wide hall beyond. He too came under the ap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">praising eyes of Professor Markleson. There was something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">familiar about the gray, pointed Van Dyke as worn by Dr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jorgstedt 1 Yes, Professor Markleson felt deep within his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">soul that he had seen that beard and those deep set features be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fore. - He covered his aching eyes with a trembling hand and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then looked again at the man approaching him. With eyes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon the gray, pointed tip of that Van Dyke, nerves tensed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the snapping point, his brain whirling with a maelstrom of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">faces, objects and events, the scientist suddenly seemed to grow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rigid--then leapt from his chair with a blood-curdling yell I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Roaring with the cry of a blood-thirsty beast. Professor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Markleson lunged forward. Despite his weakened condition</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and taxed strength, he dashed across the lounge with astound-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing swiftness and with a half dozen bounds his once powerful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fingers clutched the throat under the gray Van Dyke!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">TAKEN unawares in the act of greeting his old friend,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Jorgstedt seemed stunned by this unexpected out-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">burst of hostility on the part of the famous physicist. Before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he had a chance to defend himself from the other's savage</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rush, cruel fingers were biting into his jugular vein, cutting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">off his wind and throttling him mercilessly. He went down at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">once under the superior weight of the scientist, whose weakened</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">legs tried vainly to hold him while his hands began to choke</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">' the life from the astronomer's body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Friends galvanized into action after a moment of astonish-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment and pulled them apart. Professor Markleson struggled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to break loose and get at the astronomer once again, but he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">held tightly. He vented his rage in stinging epithets. Dr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jorgstedt shook himself free and stared at his former friend</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in open-mouthed astonishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You might at least have shaven off your filthy whiskers,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Jorgstedt I" Professor Markleson raged.

My fingers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">itch to tear open his dirty throat!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Jorgstedt stared in amazement around the circle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">1022</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">faces that regarded him inquiringly. He was suddenly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered at the strange, hostile attitude of Professor Markle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, and was plainly alarmed. A man near him spoke softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you know, Professor Markleson has been under extreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical difficulties, doctor," he said, "and is not accountable</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his actions. He is probably laboring under an illusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">and does not recognize you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a lie!" the physicist shouted, struggling to release</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. "He is Doctor Jorgstedtl I recognize everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowl You, my good friend, are Professor Brandon I I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">name every one of you now!

He noted tliat Jorgstcdt's face had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken on a heavy coat of tan tliat had not been there before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nor could such a nut-brown color be obtained within the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fines of the Sky Urchin unless he had stood in the sun light</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the control bridge exposed to the violet rays that beat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the transparent observation bands. Even then many</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks of constant exposure could liardly create such a deep tone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the scientist's mind clearly considered all this, he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled and downcast, as though his mind had been playing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him tricks. Did he really, now, remember the Van Dyke beard?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you mean to say you were not on the Sky Urchin at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, Dr. Jorgstedt?" he asked, his eyes suddenly becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">moist and glassy. "Are you certain of it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perfectly certain, my friend!" he replied, meeting his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">squarely. "Beyond seeing her pictures in the newspapers I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have never set eyes on the Sky Urchin!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then will you accept my sinccrcst, my profoundest. apology</seg><seg type="columnLine">for my actions, my dear friend?" said Markleson earnestly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">striding forward with hand outstretched.

Jorgstedt replied, grasping the hand of his friend in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm, affectionate clasp. "The other party must certainly have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a ringer for me 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From what I could see of him he was 1" the physicist replied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking the astronomer by the arm and leading him to a far</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner where they sat down out of earshot of the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIR a long time they sat in earnest, friendly conversation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">What was being said between them no one in the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to hear, nor to care about, for that matter. All were</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much engaged in discussing their own affairs to eavesdrop</seg><seg type="columnLine">on others. Professor Markleson explained himself thoroughly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">omitting not a single detail of his experience. He illustrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the close similarity between the famous astronomer and the Sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruler himself, although he had only seen enough of the lattcr's</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard to arouse his suspicions. He conceded presently that that</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone was insufficient for his resulting conclusions. But in ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition the voice had sounded amazingly like the doctor's!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then the Sky Ruler still remains a mystery I" said Dr. Jorg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stedt, by way of closing the unpleasant incident of the recent</seg><seg type="columnLine">past. "What a wonderful ship he must have stolen!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Still a mystery, Doctor I" the physicist said, suddenly tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">and weary. "The Sky Urchin is a wonderful ship indeed! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt if I could ever build another, because of one complicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical system. The thief took the plans--the ship--every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing! It must be recaptured without damage to protect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans, which arc doubtlessly on board. If by any chance they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been disposed of to a foreign power--and I don't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have been--then we must liave the ship itself so that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can build more like her.

But we must have her intact 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you suppose that this Sky Ruler is by any possibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the men you had working for you on the ship's con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction?"

Somehow he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not seem satisfied with the sincerity of that last question. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to have been asked guardedly as though trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel him out for all he could give. His eyes narrowed as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">beheld a slight, unnatural tremble in his friend's hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '"No, my friend," the physicist replied, trying to speak casual-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, but watching the'othcr's face intently.

There was, he decided, a mighty close simi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larity between that figure and the athletic frame of the Sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruler! He slapped a knee and swore at his suspicions. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">squared his shoulders; then, feeling the sudden effects of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strenuous events that had made his mind normal again, he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and went out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Markleson Returns</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON the Sky Urchin, the self-asserted Ruler of the Heavens</seg><seg type="columnLine">lolled lazily in the big, spacious chair in the rear cab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in lighted through the transparent bank, and casually</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied a sheaf of plans. The huge silver hulk was cruising</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the higher reaches at moderate speed.

He and the scientist worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirelessly side by side at the bench on the more intricate details</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Magnetic Ray Projector while the senior students pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared the rest. During the five years he had spent as Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Markleson's understudy, Jack Reeves had become very</seg><seg type="columnLine">proficient He had been given many opportunities to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his own theories at the personal expense of the generous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind-hearted scientist And as for Markleson--when he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the details of his ray device, his heart sang with bound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less praise for this young man who, realizing the desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">straits in which the world had found itself since the Sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Urchin was stolen, had begun to apply his genius to its appre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hension. The scientist knew at once when he looked at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans that here indeed was an instrument as important to man</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Sky Urchin itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Here was an invention that would be invaluable to any na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion--one that could be utilized nation-wide in time of peace as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as war.

Professor Markle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son chuckled to himself as he worked, running those thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and over in his mind. Yes, the Sky Ruler had built castles</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air, but at the pull of a magnetic ray these castles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon to topple to earth I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg><seg type="columnLine">An Unbreakable Grip</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE came a day when the sky was queerly void of</seg><seg type="columnLine">aircraft. Nowhere in the heavens could there be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ship of any type. But that was not a strange occur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rence now; it had happened several times during the past few</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, especially when the day had arrived for the Sky Urchin</seg><seg type="columnLine">to appear in the upper air levels, (eady to rake the sky with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its all too accurate machine guns and deadly bombs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Once again toll day for the United States had arrived and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time the government was to choose between paying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sky Ruler's demands or having the continent plunged into</seg><seg type="columnLine">mourning. True, the government had plainly told the Sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruler to go to hell on his last visit and liad gotten away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">it But now it was a case of cither paying two months' toll,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or having New York, Washington, and other big cities laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ruins. The Sky Ruler had demanded exactly ten million</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars in gold, under a threat to drop a dozen high-explosive</seg><seg type="columnLine">missiles right into the heart of Washington!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what the Sky Ruler expected was one thing, and what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he actually received was another! He had plunged the Sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Urchin across the heavens like a comet from the westward, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving exhausts causing a five-mile-long tail of purple flame to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scar the skies from its rear. Even at its great altitude the hiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the craft's open exhausts was audible to those who watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">it tensely from an isolated area on the outskirts of Washing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton. Over the Capitol buildings, ten miles up, the Sky Urchin</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted, hovering as easily in the rarefied air as an ocean vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchored in the safety of its harbor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As Professor Markleson watchcd his stolen airship through</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful binoculars, tensed almost to the snapping point with</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement and undying hatred, he observed that the huge mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster of the skies lay aloft with scarcely a movement He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tiny object detach itself from the ~„elly of the glistening</seg><seg type="columnLine">hulk and plunge earthward. He watched its downward descent</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it vanished behind a screen of trees. Expecting momen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarily to hear the crashing roar of high explosives, he sat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense suspense, scarcely breathing. But no such explosion</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoed to his ears. It was just another of the Sky Ruler's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensational messages, though how it read he could not know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He manipulated the range gauge on the binoculars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought the silvery hulk even closer. He thought he saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement on the control deck through the transparent fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward band. But he was not certain. Then another missile</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped suddenly from the great craft. With an increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle it approached the earth, straight down. Was it an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other message, or had the Sky Ruler become enraged at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">delay in sending up the blimp that was to deliver to him ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actly ten million in gold bullion?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardly had Professor Markleson dropped a hand to signal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to young Jack Reeves, who sat at the rheostat controls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Magnetic Ray Projector, when the echo of a terrific explosion</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent his ears. The roar stunned him for an instant as his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped. The earth seemed to tremble under the thunderous</seg><seg type="columnLine">concussion and he saw a mass of swirling debris and dust ris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing scarcely a mile away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JACK REEVES, sitting at the controlling instruments nestl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing under the base of the projection tower on the flaj car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent over the apparatus instantly. His nimble fingers twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a series of rheostat control dials, and the gyroscopic drum on</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of the tower began to move in a slow rotating motion. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the gyrostat dial, and the drum, like a huge, round-</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed searchlight, began to rotate on its jointed axis with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ominous whirring. Back and forth, up and over it swung,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until suddenly it stood rigid with a jerk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">What Markleson saw through his binoculars caused him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">let out an excited yell.

The scientist, through his glass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrated his gaze upon the foreward insulation band.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through it he could sec indistinguishable figures darting about</seg><seg type="columnLine">in bewilderment As though held captive by an invisible leash</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached to a bull ring on the end of its pike-like snout, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sky Urchin stood rigid with its nose on an angle, pointing di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly at the drum atop the projection tower I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Invisible as it was, Professor Markleson knew that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetic ray had drawn the Sky Urchin's nose within its in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluence to be held in an unbreakable grip to the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam I But somehow they had overlooked the possibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grip being broken by a sudden splurge of power from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship's propulsion rockets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From behind the Sky Urchin there came suddenly a terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar. A score of long, yellow jets of flame shot from its ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausts.

Then with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">startling abruptness that must have hurled its crew in all' di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rections, its rapid descent was checked, while its tail began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to swing around in great circles. Under the tremendous power</seg><seg type="columnLine">that must have emanated from the exhausts, the Sky Urchin</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun around, with its nose held like a captive fish, desperately</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking its freedom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Markleson let go his binoculars. They dangled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of a loop slung around his neck. He danced with glee</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yelled like a madman.

Then under full force of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving exhausts the great Sky Urchin shot like a falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">comet toward the earth. Stunned and foolish, the scientist and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the officers stood still, too much awed to move as the glisten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hulk bore down upon them. It roared through the heavens</seg><seg type="columnLine">like some tremendous terrestrial monster, traveling on an angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would carry it scarcely more than a few thousand feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">above them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a disheartened groan Professor Markleson threw him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self flat on the ground, in an effort to escape death by cre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation from the blazing wake of the oncoming menace.

He pictured the end--the stark ruination of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Magnetic Ray Projector 1 His mind whirled with scenes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death and destruction. Then he cursed himself for a blithering</seg><seg type="columnLine">idiot for not having jumped at once underneath the flat car</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn the cause of the disaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shot a glance at the Sky Urchin. It had now flattened</seg><seg type="columnLine">on even keel and was hurtling across the sky some 10,000 feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, i's exhausts driving it to full velocity as though the pilots</seg><seg type="columnLine">were endeavoring to escape with their lives. Instantly lie leapt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">up and made a dash for the car. Stooping low he literally</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled himself under it, bumping his shoulder on the platform.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a numbed hand he grasped a contact wire that hung loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">?nd away from its shoe. Careful lest he touch bare copper or</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel, he plunged the wire onto the rail amid a shower of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crackling green sparks. At once he discovered that the wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">had jumped from its socket in the shoe that traced the rail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wasting valuable seconds he jammed the bare end of the cable</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the socket, gave it an extra shove and rolled away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">it He sat up on the ground well away from the car and rubbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his smarting eyes. If he had ever faced death in all his life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had certainly confronted it under the car. But he had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to realize the fact It was a humane act of Providence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he escaped without more than stinging eyes as the result</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the high-tension flashes and spark showers 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Young Jack Reeves, sitting at the controls of his invention,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast a frightened glance at his benefactor. But he refused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">quit his post. Aware that the current had once again thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">his magnetic beam into the air, he concentrated immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the rheostats. Above him swung the drum in rapid, spas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">modic rotation, projecting its invisible magnetic beam into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens, nervously searching like a searchlight for its objec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive. He twisted the rheostats with tense, bloodless fingers, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasing the range of the beam to near capacity. The Sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Urchin had vanished into the distant skies, yet not so far but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the beam, with the speed of light, caught up with it The</seg><seg type="columnLine">young scientist gave a yell when the projector stood suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigid, facing the direction which the monster of the air had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken. He threw on full power at once and the apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">hummed with a terrific throb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE touched a button switch that threw into action the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traction units. Glancing at the range dials he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicator slowly pushing toward zero. He grasped a dial</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly and increased the retraction until the indicator swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">over its orbital course more rapidly. The drum-like projector,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting its invisible magnetic ray, faced the east, rigid and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taut. With a joyous shout he leapt down off the car and dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Professor Markleson's side. The scientist was dusting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing. In his eagerness Jack grabbed him brusquely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung him around</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've got her!" he yelled, pointing eastward.

Scien-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tists and government representa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tives had been on board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The world flight had been made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at a slow speed, the projectile</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moving at no time faster than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">five thousand miles an hour and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at an altitude of twenty miles to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">prevent heating from friction</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the atmosphere.

In fact</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the speed of five thousand miles an hour would closely approach</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that of meteors, which become heated to incandescence when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they enter the Earth's atmosphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Provision had been made against such heating by employing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">liquid air for cooling the outer shell.

Tonight the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends were to set out in an effort to reach Mars. Naturally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the announcement of their plans had caused a stir throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world. Scientists were not in agreement as to the outcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the venture. Some believed Dr. Fry could take his craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">through space on an interplanetary voyage and return to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth. Others doubted the possibilities of the projectile on such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stupendous undertaking. They sought to dissuade Dr. Fry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom they regarded as the foremost scientist living and there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore a man too valuable to civilization to justify the taking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such chances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But Fry was obdurate, and so was Randolph. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined to start on the great adventure of which they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed for years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Entering into the plans of the two men had been a computa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in higher mathematics such as was practiced by the as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronomers of the day. The projectile, moving at terrific speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had first to be aimed with the greatest precision. Success de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended on angular reckoning. Dr. Fry, as astronomer, physicist</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mathematician, was second in this to no man alive. Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peatedly he had gone over his figures, and always his findings</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Both Fry and Randolph believed the chance for success was</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth the risk and the effort. The projectile had been tried and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested. Its speed was definitely known. Fry knew it would es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape the atmosphere of the Earth and overcome gravitational</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull. And then, carefully aimed and headed straight for Mars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at maximum speed and under gyroscopic control, he believed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would continue without deviation from its course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The hour for the departure had come. Streaks of flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">illumined the night sky. They were off I The winking lights of</seg><seg type="columnLine">St. Louis dimmed rapidly as the projectile rose swiftly to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper air level, its rocket tubes emitting blasts that roared mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentarily and then became hushed to a low drone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With the delicate instruments he had perfected, Dr. Fry aimed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the shell with the greatest precision at a definite point in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heavens. He knew that when he got to that place Mars would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have moved there to meet them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rushing Through Space</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS the projectile rushed through space, the two men moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">leisurely about, for there was nothing for them to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	In addition, the projectile was provided with other sets of tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertically placed beneath the craft to give it the buoyancy desired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">No lifting gas was required. And there were other sets of tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which atomic energy could be released, but these were for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the projectile's protection against possible foes. This power was</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely blasting in its destructive force, a disintegrating weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">more annihilating than any the world had ever seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The projectile was provided with ailerons, but these were for steer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing only in the atmosphere. Gyroscopic control had been provided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the shell on its course in empty space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In addition, since the craft's interior was to be occupied, a third</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner shell had been used 3s a lining. Powerful pumps maintained</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vacuum between it and the shell that enclosed the liquid air. Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">insulation was provided to protect the cooling element against interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">heating for warmth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The great shell of tough metal found no resistance here. It had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cleared the atmosphere of the Earth with sufficient velocity to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">overcome gravitational pull, and they were speeding along now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the globe rapidly diminishing in size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Absolute zero did not affect them. Dr. Fry called Randolph's</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to the thermometer. It stood at 72 degrees Fahrenheit</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside the great shell. Outside, the scientist knew, it was abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lute zero, a cold which is not exceeded in all the cosmic scheme.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Randolph looked up to find the eyes of his friend upon him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neither showed the slightest concern. Unlike as two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be, they yet had in common the dauntless spirit of adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. They had realized, of course, that they dared oblivion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But what matter? It was the great adventure I Times had</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed with the advancement of science, and they had risen</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal to the occasion. They were men to dare oblivion, eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Satisfied, Leonard?" asked Randolph, his tone indicating</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he knew what the answer would be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Perfectly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And so am I."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Leonard Fry was a man a little above medium height</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of compact, athletic build.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist's gray eyes were dear and steady as he looked into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">void through which they were rushing. His high, wide forehead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which his dark hair swept back, showed no lines of worry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His sensitive mouth reflected a smile of confidence, and his color</seg><seg type="columnLine">was heightened by the thrill of the adventure he had dared. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">reclined in an easy chair, apparently as comfortable as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sat in his apartment discussing plans with his friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Here, thought Randolph, was concentrated the ultimate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">human force in this one man, who at thirty-five easily led the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific world. Everything about him suggested power, mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">resource, courage, daring, will. His confidence in himself, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randolph knew, was so limitless that he might have been con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered the foremost egotist alive, but his friend had long ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">found denial of this in the fact that Leonard Fry had always</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded. There lay the proof that he knew, and knew tliat</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You have no regrets, Randolph, old fellow?" Fry was turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the pages of a book. Randolph noted that his friend's grace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful but powerful hands were as steady as a man's could be.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no nervousness here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None," answered Randolph. "And if I had--" he merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved his hand toward the projectile's stern to indicate his</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete dismissal of what they had left behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RANDOLPH was the younger by two years and a man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">great size. Six feet four inches in height and weighing</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly two hundred and fifty pounds, he yet appeared slender,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so symmetrical were his proportions and so graceful his car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage. He was a flaxen-haired, square-jawed, big-boned, elemen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal man, descendant of explorers, adventurers and pioneers</seg><seg type="columnLine">through many generations. Behind him had been conquests of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such importance that, long before Dr. Fry had discovered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret of atomic power, he was regarded throughout America</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a dominating force in business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Henry Randolph was every inch a commander, a natural, born</seg><seg type="columnLine">master of men and situations. In business he had occupied a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place equal to that won by his friend in the scientific world. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a practical and hard-headed man, but withal he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamer and an adventurer too, a man in whom the extremes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fact and fancy met and were bound together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long since these two men had discovered and appreciated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strength of the appeal each made to the other. Their na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures were, so to speak, synchronized, attuned with such a close</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach to perfection that what one lacked the other supplied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were not alike. Indeed they were strong in contrast in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">except the quality of determination, each possessed in about</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BAT-MEN OF MARS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1029</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">equal degree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With escape now woo from the Earth, the adventurers real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized that a long wait lay ahead of them with almost nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. The projectile would go on and on of its own motion for</seg><seg type="columnLine">days and weeks through the thirty-five million miles that sepa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rated it from its objective.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no work of any kind to be done. The great shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">was automatically controlled, and only a glance at the course</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicators every few hours was necessary to make sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">tliey were on their chosen path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men sat in the observatory enjoying the thrill of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their adventure. Highly entertained, for they had been given</seg><seg type="columnLine">a privilege no human beings before them had enjoyed, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet awed by what they beheld.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun, of course, was in eclipse, the great bulk of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth lying directly between them and the flaming orb. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no sleep for them, for they both wished to see tbe</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunrise upon the Earth, which Fry knew would come soon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Fry pointed out the planets to his friend. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars to the right of the projectile, its steady glow holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">their attention, as well it might, since it remained to be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether the planet was ever to be their destination. Mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">while from every direction, as they plunged into space, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">flamed the constellations. The heavens were literally studded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with stars that glittered as diamonds set against a background</seg><seg type="columnLine">of velvet black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then at last the adventurers were rewarded with the sunrise</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the Earth, from which they were hurtling at a velocity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of more than one and one-half million miles a day. But what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw was merely a flaming orb, the glare of a great star</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining from a dead black sky. For here, there was no dust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fillcd atmosphere to create the illusion of blue and to obscure</seg><seg type="columnLine">their vision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stars showed in every direction, undimmed by the glare from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun. Outside of the projectile there was darkness. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only inside the great shell where an atmosphere obtained that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rays of the sun were diffused into daylight. And hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in space, as the adventurers gazed back, was the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">tliey had left, its seas reflecting the bright sunlight and its land</seg><seg type="columnLine">contours showing ragged and irregular as faint, dark markings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the two men looked out into space and beheld the sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were protected from its glare by specially constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows. These were built of cylindrical filaments for strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the interior pressure and colored according to the scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tist's own carefully prepared formula.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And out there, Randolph," said Fry, "it is absolute zero. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">we opened the windows we'd soon be icicles in every tissue."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope," said Randolph, "that the glass holds!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'Well, rather," said the other, "but I am sure it will. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no resistance at all from without and that from within is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong enough to affect it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OXYGEN tanks under terrific compression supplied them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with air. Everything had been provided for their comfort</seg><seg type="columnLine">and convenience. The projectile's interior was commodious, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters extensive. There were vast store-rooms where food</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplies were carried. Also there were a gymnasium, a loung-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-room and five sleeping chambers in addition to the large</seg><seg type="columnLine">observatory near the stern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Port-holes, now closed and securely fastened, could be opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a lower deck. Here had been stored their weapons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">defense, machine guns, light and heavy rifles and vast quantities</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ammunition. There were also ports, now dosed, into which</seg><seg type="columnLine">two sets of heavy landing trucks had been drawn as the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectile left the Earth on its journey into space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Forward was the power laboratory. It had been built into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell with great care taken for its protection. It was placed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a middle deck and there were protecting walls on either side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But a system had been installed with which the craft could be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">operated from any part of the interior. Its propulsion, its steer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing when there was atmosphere, its defense tubes, everything in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact in the way of manipulation was ready at liand wherever</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Fry might be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On and on through space at terrific velocity sped the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectile. The two men inside it sat in contemplation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glories all about them; but as time wore on and their watches</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed the breakfast hour they thought of food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Randolph made the colfee and broiled the bacon while Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fry toasted the bread a rich golden brown. Eggs shirred in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric oven and crcam, fresh and sweet from a generous supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the refrigerator room, whetted their already keen appetites.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Fry buttered the toast and Randolph poured the coffee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both eagerly antidpating their first breakfast in space, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to them distinctly, as though close at hand, a human voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'Gentlemen," it said, "have you some for me? I am nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">starved I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just an instant the two men looked at each other wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they had heard the same tiling. Then tliey turned in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of the voice. There stood Alicia Rowan, Fry's fiancee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the doorway of what tliey had believed to be an unoccupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping compartment I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventurers Three</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE reaction of both men was as though a ghost had sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly appeared I They were first startled and then dumb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">founded, for they had bdieved themselves alone as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped through space. They had taken precautions to prevent a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coup of this kind from some ambitious journalist The door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hangar had been securely locked and that was how they</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it. Besides, there were only two keys that would unlock</seg><seg type="columnLine">it--as they had believed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, the vision of loveliness standing before them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof enough that the girl in the flesh was in the great shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them, bound like themselves for the unexplored realms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In amazed silence the two men regarded the golden-haired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue-eyed girl who stood there in the doorway, smiling bravely</seg><seg type="columnLine">but somewhat doubtingly as her question remained unanswered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do I look like a ghost ?". she inquired laughingly, breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now Fry spoke for the first time. "Alicia," he demanded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"how on earth did you manage it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He remembered she had begged him to take her, but he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not dreamed that she would attempt this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leonard," she replied tremulously, although she smiled hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pily, "I simply couldn't let you go without me. After you told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me good-by, I slipped out the back way where my car was</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting and I drove ahead of you to the hangar. There I let</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself in with a duplicate key I have carried for weeks. I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wax impression of your own key and here I am. Isn't it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly thrilling?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you stowed away, eh?" said Fry, wryly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. I had meant to do it all along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But this may mean the end, Alicia," he warned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know," she agreed, looking into his eyes, unafraid. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it is I shan't be down there waiting and longing for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl now sought to look deeper into her lover's eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A tender smile lit her face, but her expression was still one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertainty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you angry with me, Leonard?" she asked, simply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, bless your heart, but I shall worry about you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, please don't I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But there's no telling what we may encounter," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. "We are daring the unknown--another world--perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange beings or terrible forces.

No terrors that come</seg><seg type="columnLine">can harm me more than they can hurt you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Randolph lightened the tension with a laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anyway, Leonard," he said with finality, "the stowaway</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't be put off or taken back. She seems to have everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, absolutely," said Dr. Fry. "And now, Alicia, you con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessed an appetite. Let's eat and drink and be merry, for to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow we may--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leonard I" cried the girld. "For shame I This venture is</seg><seg type="columnLine">to succeed. 1 simply won't have you fail I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we are not supermen," he protested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are," she insisted, "and the whole world knows it I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that might not couni up here," he retorted. "But tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me," he went on, "will you promise not to fall in love with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">handsome Martian and let me go back without you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE girl merely looked at him, the light of enduring love</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her eyes, but a twisted little smile on her lips betrayed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought, her anticipation of a somewhat belated breakfast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was verified the next moment as she seated herself at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table and eagerly took the cup of coffee he poured for her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Breakfast over, Alicia told how she had carried out her plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">to board the projectile. Her duplicate key had enabled her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make elaborate plans for the venture. She had made many</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret trips to the hangar with her belongings. She had out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitted as completely as they had. Proudly she showed them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">costumes she had brought. Outdoor apparel predominated, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were pretty frocks, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By jove I" exclaimed Randolph, teasingly. "Our pretty little</seg><seg type="columnLine">stowaway is expecting to get into the Martian social register</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure as shooting I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shadow passed over the scientist's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm hoping that the Martian 400 will not try to annihilate</seg><seg type="columnLine">us," he confessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Randolph looked up surprised. From the first he had trusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friend to the uttermost limit of human powers. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">implicitly believed Dr. Fry could do anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, Leonard, we are prepared for anything that happens,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he argued</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think we are," said Fry, slowly. "But you must remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Martians might be a good deal older than we are, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a higher civilization. It is possible that we are pygmies in</seg><seg type="columnLine">power and skill and mind compared to them. That is to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even then," declared Alicia, bravely loyal, "I feel that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are superior to them, whatever they may be and whatever they</seg><seg type="columnLine">may do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Fry's countenance betrayed his misgivings, which existed</seg><seg type="columnLine">only because of Alicia's presence on the projectile. There must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be no turning back, he knew. That was impossible, for it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean defeat So, whatever the projectile's destination might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, there Alicia would be bound to accompany him and Randolph.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meanwhile he could but hope for her safety and do all in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">power to protect her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl sensed the anxiety that her lover did not voice, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she knew it was because of her. Passionately in love with him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as her presence in the projectile eloquently attested, she now</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought to dispel any worry for which she had been responsible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apart from her natural beauty, Alicia's greatest charm was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her direct speech, which she made most engaging. She now</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused Randolph's admiration anew and diminished in a degree</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fry's perplexity by the manner in which she sought to approach</seg><seg type="columnLine">a better understanding of their situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Leonard." she began, "I want you to quit worrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">about me. You must know it's far better as it is than if I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">down there alone and you were going into the unknown, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps never to return. Oh, we live and love for such a little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">space of time, and I care too much for happiness to risk it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">by staying on one world while you go adventuring to another 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I confess that I loved you too deeply for that, Leonard," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on, and Randolph listened in perfect sympathy, for here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought, was such a woman as is found but rarely. "So I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, oh, Leonard, how glad I am in every part of me I" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried. "I should have been unwilling to miss any of it, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glory of the beautiful, wonderful, terrible sun, the thrill of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventure and companionship with you--all these were lure</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, dear, and you can't blame me I Now won't you forgive</seg><seg type="columnLine">me for what I did just because I loved you so?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, Alicia," responded her lover, as, moved to tenderness</seg><seg type="columnLine">by her appeal, he embraced her endearingly, "you haven't a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to worry about and you've nothing to fear so long as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have strength to defend you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I don't mean that at all I" she declared. "I want you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel that I am not going to be in the way, a hindrance, an en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumbrance, but rather a help. This is your great and wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful adventure, yours and his. I wouldn't have you fail for life</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself. Now, won't you let me help?" she begged. "Won't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">let me share your risks the same as your triumphs when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have succeeded?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RANDOLPH was nodding and smiling his approval as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked. But he said nothing, for, although she had included</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in at least a part of her appeal, he knew it was a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently Fry permitted the ghost of a smile to escape him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then his eye brightened and his countenance cleared. Alicia</seg><seg type="columnLine">was encouraged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now promise you'll quit worrying about me!" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleaded, turning her beautiful eyes full upon them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, but / haven't been worrying," protested Randolph,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling encouragement</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I shan't--any more, I promise you," declared Fry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmly. "Why, I'm rather glad, really, that you're here, little</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Really, Leonard I" she cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, and henceforth we are adventurers three, and whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes we shall face it together. And you, I think," he praised,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"are the bravest of us all." He kissed her tenderly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl's face was now radiant She had been accepted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a comrade and partner by the two most daring and picturesque</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of her time on what, she made sure, was, up to the moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">life's greatest adventure and undertaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Watching Side by Side</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NO attempt had been made to communicate with the Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">until escape had been won from the envelope of atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere surrounding the globe. Dr. Fry steadfastly had</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed it would be possible to transmit and receive messages</seg><seg type="columnLine">through space. So now he sent messages advising that all was</seg><seg type="columnLine">well on the projectile, but refrained from mentioning Alicia's</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scientist was puzzled at receiving no replies from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth. The projectile had been equipped with a high-powered</seg><seg type="columnLine">station, with improvements designed for transmission through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ether of outer space. But nothing came. He was disappointed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A failure in that respect," he observed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, perhaps, the messages are being received on Earth,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested Randolph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I doubt it," returned the other, "The station in St Louis</seg><seg type="columnLine">has the same improvements we are using. If our messages get</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, the replies would come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The effort was repeated daily during the week that followed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but no messages came. It was as though the three adventurers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were cut off from everybody and everything, had become living</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BAT-MEN OF MARS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1031</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flotsam and jetsam in a cosmic sea, and the outcome of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">brave adventure on it was at best uncertain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Alicia's presence proved a veritable godsend as the days</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">passed. For there was a monotony that would have been intoler-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">able but for her bright presence and her gay, light humor. She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had taken charge of the elaborate and beautifully appointed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">kitchen, and had been much amused to see the world's foremost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scientist washing dishes and a multimillionaire peeling potatoes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or doing whatever she asked. She called them her kitchen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">police.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But the days passed slowly for all, it seemed, so eager were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they to reach their destination. Mars increased in brilliancy as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the distance between it and the projectile was shortened and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Earth, from which they were speeding, became but a disc,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shining like a jewel against its background of black sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Fry took careful observations from time to time. He was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">glad to sec at frequent intervals that they were holding on their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plotted course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I don't sec how we can possibly miss it," he told his com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">panions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well, I've been betting from the first we'd get there," said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Randolph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And I too," said Alicia, with enthusiasm. "And I'm wonder-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing if the Martians have good roads and motor cars, and, oh,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yes, a decent cafe! I admit I'm a little tired of my own dishes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Fry, although he confessed no misgivings, was less con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fident than they.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I have hoped for the best, you may be sure," he told them,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"but we can't possibly foresee what may await us there--pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vided always, of course, that we hit the target at which we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aimed. And the Martians, even if intelligent creatures, may</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not be human beings at all, and, therefore," he warned, "they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">might be terribly unreasonable."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And I'm betting on tliat, too," declared Randolph. "I still</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">insist, as I used to. that we shall find human beings like our-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">selves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That's right," agreed the scientist, turning to Alicia. "He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">has had a bug on that since he was a boy at school."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Again and again Dr. Fry took observations and checked his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">figures for direction. The projectile had been wholly under</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gyroscopic control, and the calculations of the scientist showed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the craft was definitely nearing the planet for which it had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been aimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mars, however, was still a long way off, some twelve to fifteen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">million miles, and a miss of a few thousand miles would be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as fatal as if the distance were multiplied by itself. Henceforth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Fry planned to keep a more constant watch of the planet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and to take more frequent observations. If there were errors,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the sooner he discovered them the better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">With painstaking care, Fry also kept track of the time. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was going now by what might be called dead reckoning so far</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as the distance covered in a given time was concerned. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had every reason to believe that the projectile was moving</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through space with a velocity of eleven hundred miles a minute,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more than one and one-half million miles every twenty-four</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The scientist seemed to the others to be on watch almost con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stantly. Rarely was he anywhere but in the observatory, busy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with his instruments. He was forever making calculations in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the higher mathematics which they did not understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Larger and larger, as they swept through space, appeared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the mass they were studying. It also became more distinct to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the naked eye. Its outline could now be seen. Long since, how-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ever, they had trained a powerful telescope upon it, bring into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strong relief the familiar markings on its surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Both Alicia and Randolph felt sure that the projectile's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">arrival on the planet was now only a matter of a few days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But Fry was not so sure. Again and again he took observa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tions and worked out his calculations. At length, when the mass</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">toward which they were rushing loomed large to the naked eye,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he discovered for the first time that the projectile seemed des-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tined to pass the planet's orbit too soon. Accordingly, he decided</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the time had come to gradually reduce their speed until</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they could depend wholly upon the planet's gravitational pull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On sped the projectile with the planet looming larger hour</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by hour. And now the scientist was tense and expectant as he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">devoted himself to his observations. At last he sighed with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">relief as the others watched. He had determined beyond a doubt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the nose of the great shell was bearing gradually to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">right</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A few days more and Dr. Fry was as a man transformed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Now he knew that gravitational pull had changed the course of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the projectile and that it was headed straight for the planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was an excited trio that now gazed at Mars and awaited</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the time when the projectile should enter the planet's atmos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">phere. All thought of food and rest had passed from their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">minds. Side by side the adventurers watched. The crucial mo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment was near at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dr. Fry had known that the atmospheric pressure on Mars</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was not so great as that on Earth, so he had perfected and em-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ployed a plan whereby those on board the projectile could be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">come accustomed gradually to the change. Day after day for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">three weeks the pressure of atmosphere within the shell had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been gradually lessened until now it was believed to approxi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mate that of the planet they were about to enter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Swiftly the mass of the red planet Mars grew in size. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seemed rushing to meet them. Gravitational pull had obviously</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">increased the velocity of the projectile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now the planet's pull was so great that the plane of their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flight became perceptibly changed. That is to say, it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">approaching the perpendicular. They realized this when the deck</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the craft began to incline. They were shooting downward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more and more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Meanwhile Fry was tensely watching his instruments. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gauge now indicated atmospheric pressure from outside the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">projectile. Then the scientist released forward rockets of atomic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">power to decelerate the velocity of the shell. It responded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gratifyingly, and now the controls were brought into use with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the craft leveled out and slowing to a cruising speed in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upper air strata.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The projectile passed over extensive areas far below, but the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">details could not yet be brought into view with even their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strongest glasses. The craft was dropping gently to a lower</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">level.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dr. Fry, naturally daring in most things, was determined now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to proceed with the greatest caution. Once more he theorized</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in explanation of his plan,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is generally believed," he told his companions, "that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">animate life on Mars is older than that on the Earth. It is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">therefore reasonable to suppose that if the planet is inhabited</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by intelligent creatures they are far in advance of ourselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Eventually, of course, our presence on the planet will be dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">covered. Indeed, we should desire tliat, but it should be under</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">circumstances favorable to us if possible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They were still at a high level and were using their power-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ful glasses for observations. They discovered there was water,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but less of it in proportion to the land areas than was the case</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the Earth. What appeared to be vast dry ocean beds were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seen stretching for great distances far beneath them. Also</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there were lines criss crossing wide expanses of terrain, and Dr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fry was delighted to find his theory regarding hem was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">proved.' They were, after all, canals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Alicia and Randolph were impatient to land, but Fry did not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">share their eagerness. He felt tliat, so far as the unknown</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">element in their adventure was concerned, the greatest perils for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">himself and his companions might still lie ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At length, however, they picked out a landing place and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slowly descended to the surface of Mars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1032</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And now it was as though Fate herself had decided that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectile should land at a most inopportune time and in a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gion extremely dangerous. Hardly could the adventurers have</seg><seg type="columnLine">chosen a less auspicious spot. Had they landed elsewhere than</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the great craters, of Dir, they would not have come in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact with the hairy Bat-men, who lived in an isolation as com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete as if they inhabited another planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Attack of the Bat-Men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OTH Alicia and Randolph were enthusiastic as the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectile was lowered gently to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm so tired," confessed the girl. "My feet are just</seg><seg type="columnLine">•ching, and this turf looks wonderful to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Bhe had attired herself in knickers and stout boots. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">amomatic hung from her belt, and she carried a light but high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">powered rifle. The two men armed themselves with heavy au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomatics and each carried a repeating rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Eagerly the trio stepped forth upon a verdant plain for their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">first contact with a world other than their own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">There was not a sign of life revealed as the adventurers</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept the surrounding country for miles with their powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses. No bird nor beast was perceived, although it was ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent when they opened the door of the projectile that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere and its temperature were sufficient to support life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was evidently midsummer in the latitude where they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed. The plain on which the great shell rested was a roll-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing prairie covered with a heavy growth of grasses. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were flowers, too, which Alicia attempted to classify without</seg><seg type="columnLine">much success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But as no animate life was seen after reconnoitering for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">radius of some hundreds of yards from the projectile, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to the craft for luncheon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Fry emphatically vetoed Alicia's suggestion for an out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">door picnic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"We mustn't think of such a thing," he declared, and Ran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dolph agreed with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Although there was apparently nothing to fear, it was Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fry's conclusion that until more was known about their</seg><seg type="columnLine">new and strange environment it would be far safer to stick close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the projectile in which they could defend themselves from</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible attack by retaliation or by flight. However, neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">man demurred when Alicia announced she would go out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick some flowers for the luncheon table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Randolph from the observatory surveyed the plain on all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides before *the girl set out. But he did not think to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Alicia had not gone more than fifty yards from the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectile when the two men, standing at an open window, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrified at seeing her snatched up from the ground by two</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange flying creatures that suddenly descended upon her. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's scream was drowned by a roar from above, as hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of strange flying beasts hurled themselves upon the projectile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The window at which the two men had stood was the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one open. Randolph had sufficient presence of mind to close it</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly and restrain Fry from leaping out in a futile attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the girl's rescue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The scientist was suddenly frantic. He had seen his sweet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart lifted from the ground and borne swiftly up and away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But now he and Randolph were forced by the onslaught from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flying men to consider^cieans of saving themselves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the craft, for any attempt at Alicia's rescue must depend upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">their survival.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Randolph, a natural fighter, manned a machine gun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprayed flapping swarms of the bat-like men. They fell like</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves in a storm, but more came. The air seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">literally filled with them. They could be heard on the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the projectile, clawing at the metal of the shell in vain at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempts to gain entrance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Fry was like a madman. He leapt to the controls that directed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the blasting, destructive force of atomic power. Randolph</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">screamed a warning just in time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For God's sake, Fry," he yelled above the rattle of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine gun, "don't do that I We don't know where Alicia is.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You might destroy her, too!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE scientist paled as he realized the danger. He went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">another port on the opposite side of the craft and got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine gun into action, killing in a fury and yelling like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage as he saw the hairy shapes of the flying creatures tumble</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground torn and bleeding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These beasts were to live long in the memory of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings who fought them and slew them in great numbers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The creatures had no weapons, but it cotild not be doubted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a hand to hand encounter they would be formidable. Sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesting the gorilla somewhat in facial features, the Bat-men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were covered with rough, coarse hair from head to foot. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful torsos and slender legs, they suggested the bat, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched along their thick, heavy arms were membranes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">enabled them to fly with great rapidity. In size they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger than human beings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never had either man seen such demonstrations of ferocity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Bat-men hurled themselves constantly upon the craft. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed over it, peering through the windows and grimacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">horribly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The slaughter continued till it sickened the two men who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been responsible for the piles of dead creatures surrounding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great heavens, Randolph," cried Fry, at last, "what are we</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to do? We're getting nowhere I Suggest something 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">We've got to save her!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But that's impossible so long as these beasts are attacking,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">replied Randolph, spraying the Bat-men with death the while.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have it I" exclaimed the scientist. "We'll ascend. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely will get rid of them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Fry set the rockets going and the projectile arose. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bat-men continued to besiege the craft, tearing at the metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof. It was observed, however, that none of the creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed the projectile on wing. Fry, in spite of his excitement</seg><seg type="columnLine">and anxiety, attributed this to the rarefied atmosphere which</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced them to fly at lower levels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The projectile climbed rapidly. Yet the Bat-men on the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to beat upon it with their great hairy hands. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fry reasoned that an even higher altitude would produce the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a higher level it was seen that many of the Bat-men leapt</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the projectile with membranes closed, and dived for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmer regions below. The hardier ones hung on for a time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at last all of them had leapt into space to escape the bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The projectile was now halted and allowed to drift in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper air. The two men held council together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our only hope, of course," said Randolph, "is the plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let's assemble it as quickly as possible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a deck on the roof of the projectile from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take off in the airplane snugly stowed under trap-doors open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into the runway. In half an hour the men had the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft ready for flight. Both were skilled pilots, and the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">was armed with a machine gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The projectile was brought under such control, with its rocket</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">power set at slow speed and its steering gear locked in position,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as would cause it to soar slowly around Mars in circuitous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flight at a high level. They could return to it in the plane at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">any time, whereas it was beyond the reach of the Bat-men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">because of its height.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Randolph took the pilot's seat in the plane at his companion's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suggestion. Dr. Fry manned the machine gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plane cruised swiftly here and there, darting over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BAT-MEN OF MARS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1033</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">plain at a low level, searching for Alicia and her captors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There below it lay the huddled masses of dead Bat-men, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowhere was there a sign of life of any kind. The surviving</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bat-men had disappeared as completely as though they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted the craters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg><seg type="columnLine">An Elemental Combat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">y* LICIA, surprised by the sudden assaurt, had been too ter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">r\ rifled to think of using the automatic still in the holster</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ at her belt, although she had seen the dreadful shapes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time to have accounted for at least one. But the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment it was impossible. She had been lifted from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground with a Bat-man on either side cruelly clutching her arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Alicia was a girl of courage, but the horror of her plight was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">too great, what with the nearness of the repulsive creatures</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the pain their talons inflicted, and she swooned as she was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">borne over the plain. At last she opened her eyes and found</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">herself in the presence of the two monsters, which, squatting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on their haunches, were looking at her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Pretending to swoon again, she closed her eyes, shutting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loathsome beasts from her vision. Meanwhile she took inven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory of herself. She had suffered nothing. Apparently she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unhurt, although her arm» were sore where her captors'</seg><seg type="columnLine">talons had gripped them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   As though in sleep, the girl rolled over on her side, moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">her right hand as she did so, and touched the automatic. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she lay still. Nothing happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Now she stole a glance at the Bat-men through half-opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">lids. They had not moved, but she saw them grimacing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other. Then one lifted his great, hairy arm with its blue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">black membrane closed and waved a gnarled thing of a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her. Fascinated, she observed the creatures, studying them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wondering if she might have a chance to escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The Bat-men for the moment did not appear to be so inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested in her as in each other. The one that had made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture snarled in a guttural tone at which the other bared his</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful teeth. Alicia did not know that at that moment they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were disputing the matter of her proprietorship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The girl and the Bat-men were inside what appeared to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grotto; at least, she could see that it was a kind of enclosure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Light streamed through broken, shapeless openings in the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">that extended upward some seven or eight feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Alicia moved her hand gently over the ground on which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay. It was smooth in slight undulations. She guessed it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be stone, or, perhaps, lava, for she remembered that the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectile had descended into what obviously was a gigantic crater.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   But the Bat-men held her attention. The controversy between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them was increasing. Fiercer and fiercer grew the snarling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creatures, which seemed quite to have forgotten her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The one nearer to Alicia suddenly leaped upon the other in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a furious attack, uttering a roar that startled her into a sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">posture. All at once the two beasts were struggling on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor of the grotto, snarling horribly and rending each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">with tooth and talon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Alicia was in a panic of fear and horror, for now she knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">intuitively that the conflict was because of her. The realiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was sickening, but, spellbound, she witnessed the struggle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">praying that the creatures might destroy each other, thus per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitting her to escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl backed deeper into the grotto as the fighting Bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men milled around in a circle, foam flying from their distended</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips and blood streaming from their wounds. Never had she</seg><seg type="columnLine">witnessed anything like this atavistic struggle. The din of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts' roars in the close confines of the grotto was deafening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meanwhile, the girl was nauseated by a musklike stench that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose from the creatures' writhing bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE wondered, as the beasts fought, whether she might</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape their notice and edge around to the opening used</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as an entrance. She determined to attempt it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moving with the utmost caution in the hope of attracting no</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to herself, she edged closer to the opening, one hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling the way along the lava wall and the other gripping her</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic. Not once, however, did she take her eyes off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brutes who were tearing at each other in what was evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fight to the death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alicia gained the opening and, stopping slightly, backed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it as the two creatures fell to the floor, writhing in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony and fury. And then, with the sunlight upon her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sweet, fresh air in her nostrils, she turned from the grotto</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fled, her automatic ready at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She ran at first blindly, choosing no course, but she soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed that she was running parallel to a long tier of grottoes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So she turned sharply away from the habitations of the Bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and courageously struck out for the open plain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alicia, as she ran, looked for the projectile, but without</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing it. Her captors no doubt had taken her a long distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she reasoned, continuing her frenzied flight. She could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that at that moment her friends were still struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the hairy hordes that had attacked them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Exhausted by her efforts and her terrible experience, Alicia</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last fell headlong in the soft, heavy grass, and lay panting</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a dazed condition of mind. She had put more than a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">between herself and the grotto from which she had escaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl lay flat on her back, arms and legs extended in</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost complete exhaustion. Dimly she was conscious that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was looking up at the pale sky in which no cloud appeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beneath her the soft, cool grass was as a bed. Before she</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized it, Alicia grew drowsy. It was with the greatest effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was able to keep awake. In spite of herself, her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed, but she did not sleep. She meant to lie there and rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">awhile . . . then to struggle on . . . away from the horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">grottoes of the Bat-men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alicia thought, when she opened her eyes, that she saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">speck in the sky. And it seemed to her, too, that she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear the faint, distant drone of a motor; but that was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible, of course. But, yes, it was possible, she reasoned. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew of the plane carried on the projectile. Perhaps Leonard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Randolph were out searching for her and were using the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane instead of the projectile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Earnestly scanning the heavens, she could see nothing, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea persisted that she could hear a humming noise as of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor. It was distant and faint and irregular in that it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went. Then at last she told herself it was fancy, so she</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed her eyes again, resting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the girl's strength returned, her faculties grew more alert.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She tried to think what might happen, what course the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men might pursue in an effort to rescue her. She prayed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had not been overwhelmed by the Bat-men but had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to fight them off. Then she remembered the open window</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feared the worst. Randolph, himself, powerful as she knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to be, would still be no match for one of the Bat-men, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">could their weapons save them once the creatures gained en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance to the projectile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If still alive, she knew, her friends would do everything in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their power to reach her. And while at times she doubted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had survived, she continued to hope and pray for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the drone of a motor again came to her straining cars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And it seemed to be closer. It was more distinct than it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been. Also it was continuous. Alicia sat up suddenly, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, as she half reclined on the grass with her elbow on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, she saw it. There it was, a sort of airplane, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly descending. She watched its approach, never doubting</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was her friends from the projectile. But in a little while she</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that that was impossible. For the approaching plane was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlike anything she had ever seen I</seg><seg type="columnLine">1034</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A minute, and it was settling lightly to the ground near her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its engine stilled. And its graceful, amber-colored wings reflected</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sunlight as though the plane were a gigantic insect halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment in its flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">              CHAPTER VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">              ^licia's Rescue</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHAT Alicia now saw presented such a contrast to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">past experiences that for a moment she was unnerved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had just fled from the most horrible creatures it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever been her misfortune to behold, and now approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">her was one of the most magnificent human beings she had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed of existing. He was a strong, stalwart young man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Could he be a Martian?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alicia tried to arise, but her exertions already had been great</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she fell back weakly. She turned her head, however, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept her eyes fixed upon the man who had left his plane and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was running swiftly toward her. Another moment, and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">knelt on the ground beside her, deep wonderment showing in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes as he scanned her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For only a moment did the man bend over her. While she</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled up at him, now confident of safety. Then he was sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly alert, as though in alarm. Picking her up bodily, he ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his craft, the engine of which he started immediately. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine rose vertically and at great speed just in time to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rush of a dozen or more Bat-men that flapped in fury</seg><seg type="columnLine">below them. Ascending to a greater height, her rescuer cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls of the crater to take a direct course at great speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they flew, Alicia studied her companion. He had addressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few words to her, but as she shook her head a puzzled look</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come into his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now and then the man would look at her searchingly, address-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her again and again in a futile effort at communication.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it was no use. She could understand nothing of what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile, Alicia wondered how she could let her rescuer</seg><seg type="columnLine">know of the plight of her friends. She knew that Jf they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">survived they would continue their efforts to free her from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bat-men, and that great danger threatened them as long as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did not know that she was no longer held captive. How to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a message to them was now her greatest concern. As to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescuer, she felt perfectly safe with him. Young, handsome and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as virile a type of manhood as she had ever seen, he obviously</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the product of a highly-developed civilization.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They flew on for about two hours and then descended as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached a strange city. Alicia gazed in wonder at the beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the scene before her. She had already concluded there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a high culture on the planet. Her contact with the stalwart</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow who had so opportunely saved her had verified it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The city before the girl's wondering eyes lay nestled in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow valley guarded by high, rugged mountains that boldly</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust upward and reflected iridescent colors in the bright sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. They were still too far away for her to make anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the architecture, so the first impression Alicia had was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">riot of gay color. Like a jewel in a rough, picturesque setting</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay the city, its buildings a variety of shades that shone in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance with a pleasing harmony of design.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY landed on a runway in the grounds of an imposing</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure standing on an eminence overlooking the city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl's companion escorted her into the building, where,</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a few minutes, Alicia found herself the center of a group</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men who regarded her with the utmost courtesy and cere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mony, but with a curiosity they failed to conceal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One after another addressed her. She could only shake her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and smile. Finally they ceased questioning her and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versed together. Meanwhile, her escort, younger than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, and apparently pleased with his achievement in bringing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">here hithfr, smilingly stood near as though to reassure her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were eight or ten men in the group. All of them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat distinguished in appearance and in fact they impressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alicia as being of scholarly type. Their manner, she observed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dignified and even profound. The girl felt tliat she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been brought to an institution of some kind, and this speculation</seg><seg type="columnLine">was supported a few minutes later when she was taken to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large hall used as an observatory. Instruments were to be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there in orderly array. The girl caught sight of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic telescope at the end of the hall. She also saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetarium at a distance while from the smooth marble walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung charts of many sizes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the group, an elderly, stately man of great dignity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gracious bearing, turned to his companions and made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion. Alicia, of course, did not understand, yet she sensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once the effect of the old man's words on the others. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted that their attitude changed instantly, their thoughtfulness</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving way to a wonderment in which it was evident there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixed a great deal of excitement. And she was certain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he had said concerned her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The white-haired patriarch, whom the others had addressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Horo, now beckoned to Alicia. She stepped forward and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">led her to a corner of the great hall. Before them was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetarium, an instrument with which she was familiar, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though she had never before seen the solar system so beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully presented in miniature. It plainly was a work of art.</seg><seg type="columnLine">attesting at once the high mechanical skill and scientific knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horo took a slender rod and touched the sun of the planetar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ium, glancing inquiringly at Alicia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl nodded that she understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next, Horo touched the fourth planet from the sun which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she knew to be Mars. Then he bowed to her and placed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands on his breast after a wide, sweeping gesture with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">outspread arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alicia knew just what he meant, and so indicated with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now Horo offered her the rod, which she took and at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicated the third planet from the sun, which was the Earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own world. Then she bowed to the group with her hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amazement spread over the faces of all, and Horo, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the first to conceive the idea that she must be from another</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, was in ecstasy because of his discovery. Eagerly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped Alicia by the hand again and led her to a chart 011 the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. Swiftly he turned the sheets over till it was her turn to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show amazement, for Horo now exposed a projection of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth's surface that actually showed the continents with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidelity of outline that amazed her.	.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here, indeed, was a skill in astronomy that was marvflous I</seg><seg type="columnLine">Certainly, she conjectured, Leonard Fry would be entranced</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it And now she gave thought anew to the problem that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been constantly in her mind, but for which she had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">no solution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked about her for the one medium with which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be able to express herself. Presently she found what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought, and now with parchment of a fine texture and a crayon</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her hands she became the center of interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rapidly she sketched the projectile in flight between the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets. Not a word was spoken by anyone, but the Martians</seg><seg type="columnLine">all hung over her shoulder in astonishment She showed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">two companions of the journey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW she pictured herself leaving the projectile and gather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing flowers in the crater where they had landed, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">her friends remained on board. Next there was a sketch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself being borne away by the horrible Bat-men. Everyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuddered as she looked up after picturing the grotto to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been carried and her escape and rescue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BAT-MEN OF MARS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1035</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alicia now turned to see her handsom^ rescuer standing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little in the rear. She welcomed him with a smile and advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take his hand and thank him with her eyes. The handsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian bent low in a graceful gesture of acknowledgment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So now the Martians knew what she had been longing to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. She hoped they could do something to relieve the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, which she knew was desperate and would remain so until</seg><seg type="columnLine">her friends could be appraised of her safety and whereabouts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horo, evidently the leader of the group, smiled and conducted</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to another room of the extensive building. The room held</seg><seg type="columnLine">many glittering instruments, some of which seemed familiar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horo led her directly to a contrivance which she guessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a transmitter of some kind. The Martian touched a switch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spoke directly into the instrument Then he invited her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do likewise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hopefully--for she had no way of knowing for certain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a kind of radio microphone--she stood before the instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and spoke into it</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lebnard I" she called. "Can you hear me ? This is Alicia I"</seg><seg type="columnLine">She waited a few moments and repeated it,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thought ran through her mind that her friends might</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be in the projectile at the time. Perhaps they were even</seg><seg type="columnLine">now scouting in the plane or engaged in combat with the Bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in the crater./</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more she called, wondering whether this instrument she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was using could be employed as a medium to communicate with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one constructed on another world. She did not know that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent Martians beside her were not worrying about that, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had long ago developed a method for use in such emer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gencies. As a matter of fact, it was accomplished by mani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">folding the message itself, which was actually transmitted over</seg><seg type="columnLine">various wavelengths and could thus be heard by any receiving</seg><seg type="columnLine">set in operation on the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no reply, but she called again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now the entire group was electrified as the answer came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a large amplifier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank God I Alicia 1" said the voice. "Where arc you ?" It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Fry speaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Safe with friends, dear," Alicia replied. "Arc you safe, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Both of us, yes I" came the answer. "And you're with</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends, you say. What does that mean ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was rescued by a Martian aviator after escaping from</seg><seg type="columnLine">those horrid beasts," she explained, "and I am safe and sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a city about two hours flight from the crater. But I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what the direction is, and I can't communicate with these</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. But I am perfectly safe with them. What do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggest?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, if a flier came out we could easily follow him in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That ought to be easy, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, of course," the girl agreed, "and I'll try to make them</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand. Stay near the crater and surely I'll find a way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach you. I'll come, too, Leonard, dear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Alicia did not know that this permission would be with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">held from her, and that, by direct order of the Kor of Osin, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the capital city of Hio to which she had come, she would be held</seg><seg type="columnLine">virtually a prisoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Projectile's Arrival</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE great shell was being held directly over the craters</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a height too great for the Bat-men to reach, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fry and Randolph waited. Both were tremendously in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested in the developments that had come so suddenly after</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heartbreaking efforts to find Alicia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had feared the worst, that the girl had been destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Bat-men. Repeatedly they had flown in the plane to</seg><seg type="columnLine">every point in the scries of craters, but the vigilance of the Bat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">men, now thoroughly aroused, had prevented them from making</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thorough search. Landing had been quite impossible, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they feared to employ the atomic power of the projectile be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause they did not know Alicia's whereabouts. What would</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy the Bat-men might also be fatal to her. Full of dejec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, they had returned to the projectile. And it was there, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">great good luck, that the radio message found them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning, a few hours after sunrise, the two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighted a speck in the sky, many miles distant They watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">its approached with intense excitement They did not doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was a Martian flier coming to pilot them to the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The craft was the same one on which Alicia had made her</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape from the crater and the Bat-men, and it was again</seg><seg type="columnLine">piloted by the Martian who had rescued her. It was unlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything the men had ever seen. It was a combination of mono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane and helicopter, and was capablc of both vertical and</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizontal flight. It was elaborate of finish and design and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markably swift They marveled at the grace of its flight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its speed, for within a few minutes after they had sighted it</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane was stilled alongside the projectile. Then a man like</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves smiled engagingly and pointed in the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">whence he had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Fry turned to Randolph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alicia did not come.

He could not speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the pilot and be understood, but he motioned first at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectile and then at the guard. The Martian showed that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood. He spoke to the people, directing their attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guard and to the projectile itself. His words and his manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be emphatic and effective, since the crowd fell back</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the guard and kept their distance. Then the pilot leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way through the human mass, which separated to give them</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage, conducted them to an elaborate, rich-looking carriage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pilot halted them a short distance away and stood at</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE carriage, propelled by engines, was ornate in design,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a graceful equipage fit for a king.

It remained on even keel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though its tail pointed downward at a slight angle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly possessed with a growing fear that the Sky Ruler</seg><seg type="columnLine">might destroy the great airship rather than submit to inevit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able apprehension, Professor Marklcson groaned aloud. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no way in the world to prevent such a disaster should</seg><seg type="columnLine">the adventurous pirate feel the urge to release its gravity re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pellent and crash it to earth or explode its fuel stores! But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely, nothing like that occurred. Not a sign of life existed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the huge craft as the scientist studied her transparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">bands with his binoculars. The control cabin and the observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion compartments seemed utterly deserted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly but surely the ship was being drawn down, as Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reeves retracted the magnetic beam. Now she lay hardly more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a half mile away, glistening brilliantly in the rays of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">westering sun. Then, to the astonishment of all who beheld</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship, a black dot appeared in the air directly under her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Almost instantly the dot was swaying in the skies like a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendulum, suspended under a bulging parachute 1 Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Markleson watched it through his glass.

They whined around the scientist like so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">bees. Then, as suddenly as they had come, the muffled throb</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the guns ceased as a row of dots appeared under the craft's</seg><seg type="columnLine">belly. More parachutes bulged, but they carried their cargoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to eager, waiting hands! The guns roared again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professor stood calm in a rain of singing shells. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">hummed melodies of death about his ears and spattered dirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere as they plopped into the ground, only fifty yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. An anti-aircraft gun suddenly roared. A shell cracked</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty feet beyond the Sky Urchin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Markleson saw two more parachutes open under atmospheric</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistance. Then another man leapt from the Sky Urchin. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist watched him through his glass. The man wore no</seg><seg type="columnLine">parachute! He thought that the man wore a tight-fitting fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing outfit of black--but he was not sure. He could not be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve that the Sky Ruler would elect to take his own life by</seg><seg type="columnLine">suicide. The man could easily have destroyed himself instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he elected to explode the Sky Urchin! A long time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think about death--falling 2000 feet! The man tumbled, head</seg><seg type="columnLine">over heels through the air to vanish behind a bank of foliage</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quarter of a mile away.

Was it the magnetism that exists be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween two very dear friends that caused him to respond to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">urge to visit the morgue? Or was it just morbid curiosity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn if Doctor Mars Jorgstedt had died or was suffering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mortal agony of fatal injuries? Whatever it was, it attracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, protestingly, to the forbidding gray building off the wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">traffic-jammed avenues.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He entered without a pause and was met by a blue-coated</seg><seg type="columnLine">minion of the law.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am Professor Markleson, Captain," he said, his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling.

"Go on in!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quietly the scientist swung open the door and entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first room to the left. He paused just inside, his hand still</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the door knob, and stared from one face to another--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead and the living! Then with a light step he strode to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of his friend, Dr. Jorgstedt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will you ever forgive me, Doctor?" ke said softly, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face sad and forlorn.

He wore neatly-trimmed whiskers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Van Dyke style. The scientist scrutinized the deep-set features</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his friend. A tear was streaming down the latter's tanned</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who is lie, Doctor?" asked Markleson. "Do you know him?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The famous astronomer peered into his friend's forlorn face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Few people knew that I had a brother--a twin brother."</seg><seg type="columnLine">he replied, erasing the stinging tear with a shaking finger. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was taken away from me about a year before you and I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came acquainted, to be placed in a house of correction until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was 21.

"There is one there, but it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">put there by any air bandits. That valley has a deposit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some curious mineral that is continually giving off energy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the form of electrostatic. The whole valley is located over</seg><seg type="columnLine">this bed. This elcctro-static leakage continues all the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">and keeps the soil and the air of the place in an unhealthy con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition. That's why you see no vegetation, flies or other life</seg><seg type="columnLine">in there. The natives knew that there was something unhealthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the place and kept away from it Now one proof that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this queer mineral deposit is giving off static electricity is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that when the ground becomes moist the energy escapes</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a faster rate, until you can see it at night in the form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">amber-colored shoots of fire. Also--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'■TJUT do you mean that just because the air becomes moist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I) the static in the air over the valley increases so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it even paralyzes the ignition systems of the planes?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Whenever it is raining," Tom replied, "there is usually a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thunderstorm passing over the valley. The clouds in this storm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are charged with a potential opposite to that of the ground and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">occasionally the difference of pressure of the two forccs is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sufficient to cause a lightning bolt to strike the earth some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">where. That discharge of lightning looks like a discharge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the sky to the earth but really there is as much energy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">passing from the earth to the sky along that flash during the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">discharge. Now, when a storm passes over the valley, its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clouds, charged oppositely to that of the forces in the valley,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cause a drawing effect on them, and the leakage of energy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the ground to the sky increases greatly as it passes up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in an attempt to neutralize the forces of opposite charge in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the clouds. Also the moisture in the air and the ground increase</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the conductivity of the air between the clouds and the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This valley, Jim', seems to be an endless and limitless source</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of such energy, and during a storm it releases such a heavy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">discharge of static that it drowns out radio signals, makes the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">compass freeze and point up and down, affects the human sys-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tem producing that sick tired feeling. And when the difference</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of pressure becomes very great, the discharge from the valley</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is so violent that fire and electrical energy will leak off into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the air from every sharp point or object tliat is touching the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ground and pass straight up into the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The magnetic force of that field over the valley is so great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">during a thunderstorm that the ignition generators of the planes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">.are affected so that they start missing and sputtering. As a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ship enters into the heart of the powerful static field between</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the clouds and the valley, the plane's ignition system steadily</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">becomes worse as the electrical energy fails. But the effects</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the magnetic fields alone are not responsible for the death</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Weldon or the others who will likely be found in tliat val-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ley. There is a poisonous clement in that mineral deposit under</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the valley and it leaks off with the static discharges. It is this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that poisons the air, and if you remain in the place long enough</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will kill you completely."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Wait 'till Watson hears about this, Tom," Jim said wearily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, I expect there'll be a few government inspectors that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will get transferred from the South African territory when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Watson lets loose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">              The End,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Arctic Rescue</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         (Continued from page 983)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tioning as well as could be expected.

Commerce and industry</seg><seg type="columnLine">are at a standstill as a result of the Russian's radical methods.</seg><seg type="columnLine">People are starving I And all this damage caused by one man I</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's awful to contemplate I" He was silent for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then exclaimed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, the sooner I get back and start things moving, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">much quicker will order be restored."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A New Attack</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TURNING, he moved toward his plane.

We feared a night attack by the Russian, and kept</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">great beacon lights from the landing field trained upon the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The rising sun-received a hearty welcome in the morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That morning seemed endless, with nothing occurring fo</seg><seg type="columnLine">break the monotony of waiting. Noon came--and suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cry arose from one of the men appointed as a lookout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's coming!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment we had gathered in a scattered group on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawn before the Union Hall. While we waited, we looked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our glass ray-filter bands and our rods, to be certain that aH</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in readiness for Demctriovich's destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A minute of anxious waiting--then the cone'was above us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We expected to hear the thunderous voice, but no voice came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead, a blinding, white ray flashed down upon us. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">island seemed to tremble under our feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At the same time that he released the ray upon us, a veritable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shower of thin, intensely powerful beams darted up toward the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cone from the balls on the tips of our metal rods. Had it not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been for our lack of experience in operating our strange weap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ons, and our consequent erratic aim, Demetriovich and his cone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would have been blasted into a cinder. As it was, only a few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the rays hit their mark; but so effectual was the work of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">those few, that the white ray was snuffed out, and the cone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">staggered I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It had evidently escaped serious injury, for a second after</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">our rays struck--indeed, before we could adjust our aim, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cone leaped high into the air. Our rays followed, and evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">took some effect in spite of the cone's increased altitude, for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment later, like a frightened hare, it darted away in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction from whence it had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of the men began shouting triumphantly. Vachell</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his hand for silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There's nothing to shout about," he frowned. "I feel any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing but elated. Although we did escape unscathed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russian's rays, our victory was empty. Demetriovich escaped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And now he knows that we are able to resist his rays, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we have weapons with which to fight against him. Who</seg><seg type="columnLine">can tell what he'll do next I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And remember this--although we arc unaffected by his rays,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same is not true of the island. If he returns and floods</seg><seg type="columnLine">us with the rays that bring about the travel through the vi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bratory scale, the island will vanish from beneath our feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we'll all be drowned I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The only way out that I can sec," Vachell said after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause, "is to send a radio message for help, and leave the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as possible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In a moment the entire group had started toward the tower</seg><seg type="columnLine">that held the radio transmitter. But when we arrived there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our only hope was destroyed; the radio was useless. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russian's rays, although they hadn't injured us, had left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitter burned out, blackened, wrecked beyond all repair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We returned to the Union Building in dejection. Shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we reached it, Harwood addressed Vachell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Leo," he said, "our position isn't so hopeless, after all. If</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Demetriovich does return with his cone, before he learns that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we alone can resist his rays, and that the island, itself, is un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">protected, we will have destroyed him. Our aim won't be as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inaccurate the. second time as it was the first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I suppose you're right," Vachell replied. "At any rate, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems that all we can do now is wait. If only we hadn't left</seg><seg type="columnLine">our plane in that other world, we could carry the conflict to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Russian. But--we left it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The balance of the day dragged by on leaden feet. As night</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached, we became restless, apprehensive. Nor were our</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits buoyed up by the discovery that the searchlights that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had used the night before were burned qut. We would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to spend the night in darkness. If the cone returned, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be unable to detect its approach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Darkness found us waiting. We were all close to exhaustion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet we dared not sleep. There was little or no conversation;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some reason we had no desire to talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hour after hour passed by. One o'clock came--then two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and without warning four wide beams of violet radiance split</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blackness. They came from the different points of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">compass, and converged on one central point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four cones--could we overcome them?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE centered our efforts on one of them, aiming at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">source of the violet beam. Suddenly the ray from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">cone was snuffed out, and a moment later, a loud crash some</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance away told us that one of our combatants was out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The destruction of the first cone had taken but a moment;</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly we turned our attention to a second. A beam of red</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended from this cone now, a beam that set nearby shrub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berry afire, but that had no effect upon us. We showered our</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender rays upon it to such good cffect, that it, too, was snuffed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only two cones remained, and we had not been harmed!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As we turned toward the third, both cones darted high into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air. Then, twin streams of white leaped from them; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE INVISIBLE DESTROYER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1039</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">island shuddered under the impact. It was the ray that caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passage into other vibratory worlds 1 Frantically we sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">our rays flashing upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fleeting picture passed through my mind, a picture of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us falling into a bottomless pit--of mighty walls of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing in upon us--of motionless, floating bodies . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortune was with us 1 Our rays again found their mark, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the third cone fell to the island like a plummet 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">One more cone to destroy! But was there time ? The island</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost gone I Our footing was becoming insecure. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">island, wavering on the borderline between the worlds! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cone was darting here and there erratically, now; we could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow with our rays. A moment more, and it would be ended 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">A moment more--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden, sharp explosion--an ear-splitting crash tliat shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth--and the white beam was gone; the island was solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">under our feetl</seg><seg type="columnLine">We stared at each other in wonder by the fitful light of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning shrubbery. On the brink of destruction, and a bolt</seg><seg type="columnLine">from above had saved us. What had been the cause of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion? Something amiss in the cone, perhaps, effected by</seg><seg type="columnLine">our rays?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then we saw the helicopter. Swaying drunkenly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">side to side, its motors dead, supported only by its buoyancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanks, it settled slowly to the earth. It landed a short distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly we rushed over to the plane. Its entire front was</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed in. And amid the wreckage, the lower half of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body crushed to a bloody pulp, we found Kieth. He was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious. His face, smiling wanly, seen by the flickering light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked ghastly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clasping VacheU's hand weakly, he whispered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Leo, I guess it's almost over.

He stiffened convulsively;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shuddered; and suddenly grew limp. He was dead. He had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">died for a cause--a martyr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Almost over night the world was restored to normalcy.

The human body is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to constructed, that a sudden nullification of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the force of gravity on an individual person</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> would result in immediate death.

If we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> regard gravity as the mutual attraction be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tween one mass and another, the strength of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> which can be calculated by the dimensions of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> these masses, we have a working principle which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> will enable us to understand tbe general condi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tions space fliers of the future will have to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> operate under. The moon is smaller than the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> earth--therefore tbe force of gravity on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> surface of the moon is less than that on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> surface of the earth. Should there be life on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> planets larger than the earth, this life will be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> adapted to the stronger gravitational force main-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> taining on those worlds. This is a simple law,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> stated in simple terms, aud abstruse theories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> about gravity merely becloud our understanding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   As a matter of tact, this law was laid down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> by Newton, who, in suggesting that gravity was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fundamentally a property of matter, stated the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> law of universal attraction as follows: "Every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> particle of matterin the universe attracts every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> other particle with a force varying &gt; directly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as the product of their masses and inversely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as the square of the distance tbat separates</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> them."

A. Bevan, who like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise was stirred up by the same letter. (It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was intended to stir things up, and seems to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have succeeded beyond all hopes.) As to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation of the lift ou the wings of a plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is evident that we do not conflict as to facts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whether his terminology (see the September</seg><seg type="columnLine">number) was misleading, I think would have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be left to the readers. It is not a very vital</seg><seg type="columnLine">point anyway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Major Bevan in his reply in the No-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vember number, states that my contention as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the superiority of the United States in civil</seg><seg type="columnLine">and military aviation is "too absurd to call for</seg><seg type="columnLine">much comment" I believe it can be shown that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if one is to go by the facts which seem to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">available. Major Bevan's remark, like the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port of Mark Twain's death, is considerably ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aggerated. Let us take the military aspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At present the number of military planes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">commission in the United States is kept con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidential, as it should be. But tbe Aircraft Year</seg><seg type="columnLine">Book shows that 1861 engines for military use</seg><seg type="columnLine">were produced during 1929. In 1928, 1213 mili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary engines were produced. I do not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how many of the latter are still in commission.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is safe. 1 think, to assume that 2000 to</seg><seg type="columnLine">2500 in all are still extant. 677 planes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced, being 44 per cent less than in 1928.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In 1928-29 it would thus appear that about</seg><seg type="columnLine">1700 planes were produced. In the last two</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, then, we have put out of military use not</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than 3000 engines and 1700 planes. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposition has been made of these engines and</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes, resulting in what present strength, is as</seg><seg type="columnLine">said a secret of tire War Department Like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise our resources in planes and engines al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready on band before that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Leipzig Illustrierte Zcitung gives for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">military strength of the various nations, r ranee</seg><seg type="columnLine">2560, England 1500, and then on a rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">descending scale to Portugal with 120. Innce</seg><seg type="columnLine">the article in which these figures were given</seg><seg type="columnLine">was written for the purpose of showing the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">supremacy of these nations over Germany, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not probable that they represent a minimum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unless authentic contradiction can be produced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I believe that one is justified in believing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States stands about on a par wit*</seg><seg type="columnLine">France, and much above the rest Certainly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least in any number available for invasion by</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrier ships or other known means.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now as to civil aviation: on November 2nd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">1929,' according to the Department of Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merce, there were in the united States 6,378</seg><seg type="columnLine">licensed planes and 3,083 identified planes; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">total of 9,461. The latest figures available for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe. 1928, show the highest number of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">aies in Italy, with 1000. France is next with</seg><seg type="columnLine">. Germany, which Major Bevan specifically</seg><seg type="columnLine">cites for superiority, had 535. To reach civil</seg><seg type="columnLine">equality with us. Germany during 1929 would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have had to produce nearly 9,000 planes. Can</seg><seg type="columnLine">Major Bevan produce any figures to prove that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she did? I think not, especially when Foreign</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aeronautical News of tbe Department of Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merce shows that during 1928 all Europe pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced only 1500 planes of all type*--this de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ficiency laid by authorities to the effect of gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment subsidies.

But Horo, before permitting him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to satisfy his curiosity for a peep into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> instrument, called his attention to a plan-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> etarium. He followed the same method</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> he had employed with Alicia, indicating</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mars, or Turinia, and then the Earth, or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sjor, as they revolved around the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Horo also named the other planets and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> his pupils inscribed the names in their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> notebooks as the patriarch nodded his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> approval. In this way they were obtaining</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fragments of the Turinian tongue. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> language seemed simple. None of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> words Horo had used were long, and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> language itself was apparently liquid, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> no gutturals had yet been heard from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horo or the flying captains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   At last the gigantic telescope engaged</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> their attention. Dr. Fry, himself a famous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> astronomer and physicist, marveled at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> progress made by the Turinians. His re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> spect for Horo, master of sciences and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> high priest of Osin, deepened as the aged</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> man swung the great telescope over a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> wide arc of the heavens and identified</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> various constellations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   With the small planetarium at his side,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horo instructed Dr. Fry in his first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lesson in Martian astronomy. Indicating</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the Earth, or Sjor, low near the horizon,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> he swung the telescope full upon it. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Earth-man gasped at what he saw--a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> glorious planet, .now the "Evening star,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> shining with remarkable brilliance over a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> wide area of its surface and with a faint</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> outline of darker regions that he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> actually able to identify as the continents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Dr. Fry called to Randolph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Come and sec this," he urged. "There</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> is the outline of the western hemisphere</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of the Earth.
