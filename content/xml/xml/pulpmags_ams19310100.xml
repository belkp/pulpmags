O'Conor Sloane, Ph.D.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ANY centuries ago there was a Grecian mathema-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tician and scientist named Hero, or Heron, who is</seg><seg type="columnLine">always called Hero, or Heron of Alexandria. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">is supposed to have lived between 200 B. C. and 100</seg><seg type="columnLine">A. D. A good deal is known about him, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally most of his works have perished. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mathematician of considerable ability and of very</seg><seg type="columnLine">high standing for the era he lived in. Hero's fountain, the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teresting apparatus so often exhibited, by which water is para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doxically made to rise in a jet above its own level, is more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">an amusing puzzle at first sight, but the achievement of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">great philosopher, which is of extreme interest at the present day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is Hero's steam engine. It is a fact that some two thousand years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago a real steam engine was made, and it will be found described</seg><seg type="columnLine">in many text books. This steam engine was a reaction turbine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the turbine may be taken as the most advanced type of</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern steam engine. Naturally Hero's engine is a mere toy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it does involve the turbine principle,_ and uses directly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">principle of reaction, which is employed in rocket propulsion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobiles and planes, and this too we treat as an imperfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">novelty, when applied to anything except fireworks. But the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greek philosopher was eighteen or twenty centuries ahead of us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for reaction may yet play an important part in propulsion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When engineers began to build direct pressure steam engines</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weight of the atmosphere was used to produce the down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward pressure on the piston, for they started at once with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conception of the vertical cylinder and piston. This of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">was long before the days of piston rings of which the automobilist</seg><seg type="columnLine">hears so much. There was a groove in the piston to be filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">packing, and water was sometimes kept on the top of the piston</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep it airtight. Steam was generated in a boiler, and entering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinder below the piston forced it up to the top of its stroke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the steam had to do was to overcome the atmospheric pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sures, and in some of the old beam pumping engines the pump</seg><seg type="columnLine">rod was heavily weighted so as to help draw the piston up against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pressure of the air. When the top of the stroke was reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steam valve was closed, and a jet of water was driven into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinder. This condensed the steam and the atmospheric</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure forced the piston down again to the bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a very poor arrangement, because the piston and cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a steam engine should be kept as hot as possible. Here both</seg><seg type="columnLine">were directly cooled, but this was the first conception of a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure steam engine. Then engineers went on to construct high</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure engines of various types in which the steam after doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">its work was allowed to escape into the air, and in these early</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines, which were often of considerable size and of definitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">low speed, the valves were sometimes opened and shut by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">workman or boy. It is said that one juvenile valve tender man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged to connect his valve handles with strings to the engine so</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to make it self-operating, thus indicating a direct advance in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine. Then the next step came along. The steam from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engine exhaust was admitted into a separate condensing vessel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it was acted on by a water jet or by refrigerating tubes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that the steam was condensed outside of the cylinder and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat in the cylinder was maintained. This was Watts' great in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vention ; in its essence it is the basis of the modern low pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great object to be attained in all types of heat engine, steam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasoline or any other type, is to cover as large a range of tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perature as possible. The hotter the actuating gas is at the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremity of its action and the colder it is at the other, the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">economical is the action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This is a rough statement of the second law of thermodynamics.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In order to increase this range of efficient action within a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, experiments have been made with mercury, doing the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steam. Its vapor is very much hotter than that of water at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same pressures, and this on the face of it suggests an economy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The economy of the gasoline or heavy oil Diesel engine is due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the fact that the temperature at its maximum is that of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning combustible far up on the heat scale many times hotter</seg><seg type="columnLine">than steam. These engines, properly called internal combustion</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines, have made the airplane possible. The second law of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thermodynamics may be said to be the agent that carries air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes across continents and around the world, and that drives</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dirigibles. Every steam engine is subject to it, for steam is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas, but the law does the most advantageous work, or rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">operates under the most advantageous conditions in the internal</seg><seg type="columnLine">combustion engine, because there we use the temperature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning hydrocarbons directly, instead of the normally much</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower temperature of steam, far lower even at high pressures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old time low pressure steam engines, in which cold water</seg><seg type="columnLine">was injected into the cylinder with every down stroke, worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">most disadvantageous^-, on account of the cooling of the cylinder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And curiously enough, today we repeat that very blunder in</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooling the cylinders of internal combustion engines with water</seg><seg type="columnLine">or air currents. For the advanced type of steam engine and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last suggestions for the propulsion of airplanes and auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobiles we go back to Hero, the old philosopher of perhaps 20</seg><seg type="columnLine">centuries ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is curious to observe the efforts of mankind to develop the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat engine. • The first steam engine of perhaps 2,000 years ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a turbine--the Mauritania of the present time, with turbine</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines held the transatlantic speed record for years. The latest</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiments in driving cars and airplanes have been in the use</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the reaction of moving gases according to Newton's second</seg><seg type="columnLine">law of motion. This principle was what was used to drive Hero's</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam engine also. And in the early steam engine, centuries after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hero's with cylinder and piston, the error was perpetrated of</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly cooling the cylinder with water. This error is per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petuated in the automobile engine of today.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Prince of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By Jack Williamson</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Author of "The Metal Man," "The Green Girl," etc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jfj^VEN the Lick Observatory, which was built at the summit of Mount Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">1--J son, 5885 feet high, at tremendous expense, cannot satisfy the astronomers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An observatory that would reach about twice that height, such as the one built</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the scientist in this story, would be more likely to hit the mark.

The white sun glinted upon thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of darting heliocars, driven by silent electricity. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw back his head, gazed longingly up at an amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure that rose beside him--at a building that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the architectural wonder of the twenty-second century.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BEGUN in 2125, Trainor's Tower had been finished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly a year. A slender white finger of aluminum</seg><seg type="columnLine">and steel alloy, it rose twelve thousand feet above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyons of the metropolis. Architects had laughed, six</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago, when Dr. Trainor, who had been an obscure</seg><seg type="columnLine">western college professor, had returned from a vaca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion trip to the moon and announced his plans for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower high enough to carry an astronomical observatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving mountain conditions. A building five times as</seg><seg type="columnLine">high as any in existence! It was folly, they said. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain skeptics inquired how an impecunious professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">would get funds to put it up. The world had been mildly</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonished when the work began. It was astounded when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was known that the slender tower had safely reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">its full height of nearly two and a half miles. A beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful thing it was, in its slim strength--girder-work of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistening white metal near the_ground, and but a slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">white cylinder for the upper thousands of feet of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing height.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The world developed a hungry curiosity about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">persons who had the privilege of ascending in a swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevator to the queer, many-storied cylindrical build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing atop the astounding tower. Bill had spent many</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours in the little waiting room before the locked door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the elevator shaft--bribes to the guard had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy drain upon a generous expense account. But not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even bribery had won him into the sacred elevator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had given his paper something, however, of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">persons who passed sometimes through the waiting room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was Dr. Trainor, of course, a mild, bald man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with kindly blue eyes and a slow, patient smile. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paula, his vivaciously beautiful daughter, a slim, small</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, with amazingly expressive eyes. She had been with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her father on the voyage to the moon. Scores of others</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed through; they ranged from janitors and care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">takers to some of the world's most distinguished astrono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mers and solar engineers--but they were uniformly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticent about what went on in Trainor's Tower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And there was Mr. Cain--"The mysterious Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cain," as Bill had termed him. He had seen him twice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slender man, tall and wiry, lean of face, with dark,,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quizzical eyes. The reporter had been able to learn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing about him--and what Bill could not unearth was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very deep secret. It seemed that sometimes Cain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Trainor's Tower and that more often he was not.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was rumored that he had advanced funds for build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it and for carrying on the astronomical research for</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it was evidently intended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Impelled by habit, Bill sprang off the moving walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he glided past Trainor's Tower. He was standing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the impassive guard, when a man came past</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the street. The man was Mr. Cain, with a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile upon the thin, dark face that was handsome in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern, masculine sort of way. Bill started, pricked up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears, so to speak, and resolved not to let this mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man out of sight until he knew something about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To Bill's vast astonishment, Mr. Cain advanced to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward him, with a quick, decisive step, and a speculative</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam lurking humorously in his dark eyes. He spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">without preamble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe you are Mr. William Windsor, a leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">representative of the Herald-Sun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True.

Through the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">panels of the transparent wall, Bill could see the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread below him--a mosaic of fine points of light, scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered with the colored winking eyes of electric signs; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so far below that it seemed a city in miniature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PRINCE OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">873</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slanting through the crystal dome was the huge black</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrel of a telescope, with ponderous equatorial mount-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Electric motors whirred silently in its mechanism,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and little lights winked about it. A man was seated at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyepiece--he was Dr. Trainor, Bill saw--he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarfed by the huge size of the instrument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no other person in the room, 110 other in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strument of importance. The massive bulk of the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope dominated it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Trainor rose and came to meet Bill. A friendly smite</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread over his placid face. Blue eyes twinkled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">mild kindliness. The subdued light in the room glisten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed on the bald dome of his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Windsor, of the Herald-Sun, I suppose?" Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded, and produced a notebook. "I am very glad you</seg><seg type="columnLine">came. I have something interesting to show you. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing on the planet Mars."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. No questions, please. They can wait until you</seg><seg type="columnLine">see Mr. Cain again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reluctantly, Bill closed his notebook. Trainor seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself at the telescope, and Bill waited while he peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the tube, and pressed buttons and moved bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">levers. Motors whirred, and the great barrel swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now look," Trainor commanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill took the seat, and peered into the eyepiece. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a little circle of a curious luminous blue-blackness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a smaller disk of light hanging in it, slightly sway-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The disk was an ocherous red, with darker</seg><seg type="columnLine">splotches and brilliantly white polar markings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is Mars--as the ordinary astronomer sees it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trainor said. "Now I will change eyepieces, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will see it as no man has ever seen it except through this</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescope."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rapidly he adjusted the great instrument, and Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The red disk had expanded enormously, with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">increase of detail. It had become a huge red globe, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">low mountains and irregularities of surface plainly visi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble. The prismatic polar caps stood out with glaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiteness. Dark, green-gray patches, splotched burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">orange deserts, and thin, green-black lines--the contro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versal "canals" of Mars--ran straight across the planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from white caps toward the darker equatorial zone, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tersecting at little round greenish dots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look carefully," Trainor said. "What do you see</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the edge of the upper right quadrant, near the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the disk and just above the equator?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill peered, saw a tiny round dot of blue--it was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, but sharply edged, perfectly round, bright against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dull red of the planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I see a little blue spot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid you see the death-sentence of humanity!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ORDINARILY Bill might have snorted--newspaper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men are apt to become exceedingly skeptical. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was something in the gravity of Trainor's words,^</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the strangeness of what he had seen through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant telescope in the tower observatory, that made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There's been a lot of fiction," Bill finally remarked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"in the last couple of hundred years. Wells' old book,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'The War of the Worlds,' for example. General theory</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to be that the Martians are drying up and want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to steal water. But I never really-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know what the motive may be," Trainor said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"But we know that Mars has intelligent life--the canals</seg><seg type="columnLine">are proof of that. And we have excellent reason to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve that that life knows of us, and intends us no good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You remember the Enbers Expedition?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. In 2099. Enbers was a fool who thought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if a sunship could go to the moon, it might go to Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as well. He must have been struck by meteorites."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There is no reason why Enbers might not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached Mars in 2100," said Trainor. "The heliographic</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispatches continued until he was well over half way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no trouble then. We have very good reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think that he landed, that his return was prevented by</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligent beings 011 Mars. We know that they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">using what they learned from his captured sunship to</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch an interplanetary expedition of their own!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And that blue spot has something to do with it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We think so. But I have authority to tell you noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing more. As the situation advances, we will have need</seg><seg type="columnLine">for newspaper publicity. We want you to take charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that. Mr. Cain, of course, is in supreme charge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You will remember your word to await his permission</seg><seg type="columnLine">to publish anything."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Trainor turned again to the telescope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a little clatter, the elevator stopped again at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance door of the observatory. A slender girl ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it across to the man at the telescope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My daughter Paula, Mr. Windsor," said Trainor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paula Trainor was an exquisite being. Her large</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes glowed with a peculiar shade of changing brown.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black hair was shingled close to her shapely head. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was small, elfinly beautiful, the skin almost tran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent. But it was the eyes that were remarkable. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lustrous depths sparkled mingled essence of child-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish innocence, intuitive, age-old wisdom, and quick in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligence--intellect that was not coldly reasonable, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">effervescent, flashing to instinctively correct conclusions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was an oddly baffling face, revealing only the mood of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment. One could not look at it and say that its</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner was good or bad, indulgent or stern, gentle or</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard. It could be, if she willed, the perfect mirror of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment's thought--but the deep stream of her char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acter flowed unrevealed behind it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill looked at her keenly, noted all that, engraved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl in the notebook of his memory. But in her he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">only an interesting feature story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dad's been telling you about the threatened invasion</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Mars, eh?" she inquired in a low, husky voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid and delicious. "The most thrilling thing, isn't it?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aren't we lucky to know about it, and to be in the fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">against it!--instead of going on like all the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, not dreaming there is danger?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill agreed with her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Think of it 1 We may even go to Mars, to fight 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their own ground!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Remember, Paula," Trainor cautioned. "Don't tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Windsor too much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, Dad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the little clatter of the elevator. Mr. Cain had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come into the observatory, a tall, slender young man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a quizzical smile, and eyes dark and almost as enig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic as Paula's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill, watching the vivacious girl, saw her smile at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cain. He saw her quick flush, her unconscious tremor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He guessed that she had some deep feeling for the man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he seemed unaware of it. He merely nodded to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, glanced at Dr. Trainor, and spoke briskly to Bill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Excuse me, Mr. Win--er, Bill, but I wish to see Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">874</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Trainor alone.

In the meanwhile, I trust you to for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">get what you have seen here tonight, and what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor has told you. Good evening."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill, of necessity, stepped upon the elevator. Five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes later he left Trainor's Tower. Glancing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the vividly bright, bustling street, with its moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways and darting heliocars, he instinctively expected to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the starry heavens that had been in view from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">observatory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a heavy cloud, like a canopy of yellow silk in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light that shone upon it from the city, hung a mile above.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The upper thousands of feet of the slender tower were</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight above the clouds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After breakfast next morning Bill bought a shorthand</seg><seg type="columnLine">news strip from a robot purveyor. In amazement and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some consternation he read:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Prince of Space Raids Trainor's Tower</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Last night, hidden by the clouds that hung above</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the city, the daring interplanetary outlaw, the self-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> styled Prince of Space, suspected of the Helicon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> outrage, raided Trainor's Tower. Dr. Trainor, his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> daughter Paula, and a certain Mr. Cain are thought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to have been abducted, since they are reported to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> missing this morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It is thought that the raiding ship drew herseif</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> against the Tower, and used her repulsion rays to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> cut through the walls. Openings sufficiently large to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> admit the body of a man were found this morning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> in the metal outer wall, it is said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   There can be no doubt that the raider was the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Prince of Space" since a card engraved with that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> title was left upon a table. This is the first time the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> pirate has been known to make a raid on the surface</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of the earth--or so near it as the top of Trainor's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Considerable alarm is being felt as a result of this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and the Helicon outrage of yesterday. Stimulated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> by the reward of ten million eagles, energetic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> efforts will be made on the part of the Moon Patrol</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to run down this notorious character.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bloodhounds of Space</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO days later Bill jumped from a landing helio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">car, presented his credentials as special correspond-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent, and was admitted to the Lakehurst base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moon Patrol. Nine slender sunships lay at the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wide, high-fenced field, just in front of their sheds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the brilliant morning sunlight they scintillated like</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine huge octagonal ingots of polished silver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These war-fliers of the Moon Patrol were eight-sided,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about twenty feet in diameter arid a hundred long. Built</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steel and the new aluminum bronzes, with broad vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">panels of heavy vitrolite, each carried sixteen huge posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive ray tubes. These mammoth vacuum tubes, operated</seg><seg type="columnLine">at enormous voltages from vitalium batteries, were little</seg><seg type="columnLine">different in principle from the "canal ray" apparatus of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some centuries before. Their "positive rays," or streams</seg><seg type="columnLine">of atoms which had lost one or more electrons, served to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive the sunship by reaction--by the well-known prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciple of the rocket motor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And the sixteen tubes mounted in twin rings about</seg><seg type="columnLine">each vessel served equally well as weapons. When</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">focused on a point, the impact-pressure of their rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">equaled that of the projectile from an ancient cannon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Metal in the positive ray is heated to fusion, living mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter carbonized and burned away. And the positive charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried by the ray is sufficient to electrocute any living</seg><seg type="columnLine">being in contact with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This Moon Patrol fleet of nine sunships was setting</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in pursuit of the Prince of Space, the interplanetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">buccaneer who had abducted Paula Trainor and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">father, and the enigmatic Mr. Cain. Bill was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard as special correspondent for the Herald-Sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the night before the Helicon, the sunship which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been attacked in space, had been docked at Miami</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the rescue crew put aboard from the Avenger. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">world had been thrown into a frenzy by the report of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men who had examined the two hundred dead on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Blood sucked from Helicon victims!" the loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">speakers were croaking. "Mystery of lost sunship up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sets world! Medical examination of the two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpses found on the wrecked space flier show that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood had been drawn from the bodies, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">through curious circular wounds about the throat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunk. Every victim bore scores of these inexplicable</seg><seg type="columnLine">scars. Medical men will not attempt to explain how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounds might have been made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a more superstitious age, it might be feared that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Prince of Space is not man at all, but a weird vamp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ire out of the void. And, in fact, it has been seriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested that, since the wounds observed could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been made by no animal known on earth, the fiend may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a different form of life, from another planet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill found Captain Brand, leader of the expedition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just going on board the slender, silver Fury, flagship of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fleet of nine war-fliers.

"We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been after him seven or eight times in the past few</seg><seg type="columnLine">years--but I think his ship has never been seen. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have captured a dozen commercial sunships."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know, I rather admire the Prince--" Bill said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"or did until that Helicon affair. But the way those pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers were treated is simply unspeakable. Blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">sucked out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is hard to believe that the Prince is responsible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that.

And he has always left his en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graved card--except on the Helicon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But anyhow, we blow him to eternity on sight!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air-lock was open before them, and they walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, and made their way along the ladder (now hori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zontal, since the ship lay on her side) to the bridge in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bow. Bill looked alertly around the odd little room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its vitrolite dome and glistening instruments, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Brand flashed signals to the rest of the fleet for</seg><seg type="columnLine">sealing the locks and tuning the motor ray generators.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A red rocket flared from the Fury. White lances of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame darted from the down-turned vacuum tubes. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, the nine ships lifted themselves from the level field.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deliberately they upturned from horizontal to vertical</seg><seg type="columnLine">positions. Upward they flashed through the air, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender white rays of light shooting back from the eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear tubes of each.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PRINCE OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">875</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill, standing beneath the crystal dome, felt the turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the ship. He felt the pressure of his feet against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor, caused by acceleration, and sat down in a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venient padded chair. He watched the earth become a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great bowl, with sapphire sea on the one hand and green-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown land and diminishing, smokeless city on the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He watched the hazy blue sky become deepest azure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then black, with a million still stars bursting out in pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors of yellow and red and blue. He looked down</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and saw the earth become convex, an enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright globe, mistily visible through haze or air and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swiftly the globe drew away.

"In Scorpio, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">five degrees above Antares. Distance fifteen thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles. It seems to be round and blue."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Prince, at last!" Brand chuckled, an eager grin</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his square chinned face, light of battle flashing in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave orders that set the heliographic mirrors flick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering signals for all nine of the Moon Patrol fliers to</seg><seg type="columnLine">converge about the strange object, in a great crescent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The black fins that carried the charging vitalium plates</seg><seg type="columnLine">were drawn in, and the full power of the motor ray tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown on, to drive ahead each slender silver flier at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limit of her acceleration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four telescopes from the Fury were turned upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange object. Captain Brand and Bill took turns peer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through one of them. When Bill looked, he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the infinite black gulf of space, silvered with star-dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">of distant nebulae. Hanging in the blackness was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">azure sphere, gleaming bright as a great globe cut from</seg><seg type="columnLine">turquoise. Bill was reminded of a similar blue globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen--when he had stood at the enormous tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope on Trainor's Tower, and watched a little blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle against the red deserts of Mars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Brand took two or three observations, figured swiftly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's moving," he said. "About fourteen thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles per hour. Funny! It is moving directly toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth, almost from the direction of the planet Mars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I wonder-" He seized the pencil, figured again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Queer. That thing seems headed for the earth, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a point on the orbit of Mars, where that planet was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about forty days ago. Do you suppose the Martians</seg><seg type="columnLine">are paying us a visit ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then it's not the Prince of Space?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know. Its direction might be just a coinci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence. And the Prince might be a Martian, for all I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. Anyhow, we're going to find what that blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe is!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two hours later the nine sunships were drawn up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the form of a great half circle, closing swiftly on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue globe, which had been calculated to be about one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet in diameter. The sunships were nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand miles from the globe, and scattered along a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved line two thousand miles in length. Captain Brand</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave orders for eight forward tubes on each flier to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made ready for use as weapons. From his own ship he</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed a heliographic signal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Fury, of the Moon Patrol, demands that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">show ship's papers, identification tags for all passengers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and submit to search for contraband."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The message was three times repeated, but no reply</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from the azure globe.

A tiny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright point of violet-red fire, with a white line running</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it, back to the center of the sphere. The purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">spark grew, the white line lengthened. Abruptly, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">876</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">newspaperman realized that the purple was an object</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtling toward him with incredible speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EVEN as the realization burst upon him, the spark</seg><seg type="columnLine">became visible as a little red-blue sphere, brightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous. A white beam shone behind it, seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">push it with ever-increasing velocity. The purple globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot past, vanished. The white ray snapped out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A weapon!" he exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A weapon and a warning!" said Brand, still peering</seg><seg type="columnLine">through another eyepiece. "And we reply!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Heliograph!" he shouted into a speaking tube. "Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship will open with one forward tube, operating one</seg><seg type="columnLine">second twelve times per minute.

Blindingly brilliant rays,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight bars of dazzling opalescence, burst intermittently</seg><seg type="columnLine">from each of the nine ships, striking across a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles of space to batter the blue globe with a hail of</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged atoms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again a purple spark appeared from the sapphire</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe, with a beam of white fire behind it. A tiny purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe, hurtling at an inconceivable velocity before a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lance of white flame. It reached out, with a certain de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberation, yet too quickly for a man to do more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">see it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It struck a sunship, at one tip of the crescent forma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dazzing flash of violet flame burst out. The tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe seemed to Explode into a huge flare of red-blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. And where the slim, eight-sided ship had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a crushed and twisted mass of metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A solid projectile!" Brand cried. "And driven on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the positive ray! Our experts have tried it, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray always exploded the shell. And that was some ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosion! I don't know what--unless atomic energy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The eight sunships that remained were closing swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the blue globe. The dazzling white rays flashed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termittently from them. They struck the blue globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">squarely--the fighting crews of the Moon Patrol are</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained until their rays are directed with deadly accuracy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The azure sphere, unharmed, shone with bright radiance</seg><seg type="columnLine">--it seemed that a thin mist of glittering blue particles</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gathering about it, like a dust of powdered sap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another purple spark leapt from the turquoise globe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the time that it took a man's eyes to move from</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe to slim, glistening sunship, the white ray had</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven the purple spark across the distance. Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivid flash of violet light. And another sunship became</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hurtling mass of twisted wreckage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are seven!" Brand quoted grimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Heliograph!" he shouted into the mouthpiece. "Fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">all forward tubes one second twenty times a minute.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Increase rear power to maximum."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> White rays burst from the seven darting sunships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing off and on.

Another ship was a twisted mass of metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Seven no longer!" Brand called grimly to Bill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks as if the Prince has got us beaten!" the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porter cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not while a ship can fight!" exclaimed the Captain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is the Moon Patrol!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another tiny purple globe traced its line of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the black, star-misted sky.

A purple flash left another ship in twisted ruin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill took his eye from the telescope. The blue globe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright under the rays, with the sapphire mist sparkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it, was only twenty miles away. He could see it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his naked eye, drifting swifdy among the familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars of Scorpio.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It grew larger very swiftly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the quickness of thought, the purple sparks</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved out alternately to right and to left.

Will</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have time ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked forward. The blue globe, with the dancing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkling haze of sapphire swirling about it, was swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">expanding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The last one! Our turn now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw a tiny fleck of purle light dart out of the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panding azure sphere that they had hoped to ram. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-violet flame seemed to envelope him. He felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor of the bridge tremble beneath his feet: He heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beginning of a shivering crash like that of shattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass. Then the world was mercifully dark and still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The City of Space</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BILL lay on an Alpine glacier, a painful broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg inextricably wedged in a crevasse.

In vain he struggled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move, to seek light and warmth, while the grim grip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ice held him, while bitter wind howled about him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the piercing cold of the blizzard crept numbingly up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came to with a start, realized that it was a dream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he was none the less freezing, gasping for thin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">frigid air, that somehow would not come into his lungs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All about was darkness. He lay on cold metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the wreck of the Fury!" he thought. "The air is</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaking out. And the cold of space! A frozen tomb!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He must have made a sound, for a groan came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him. He fought to draw breath, tried to speak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He choked, and his voicc was oddly high and thin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Who are-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ended in a fit of coughing, felt warm blood spray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from his mouth.

Bill saw grotesque</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures in clumbrous metal space suits clambering</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a hole they had cut. He felt an oxygen helmet</seg><seg type="columnLine">being fastened about his head, heard the thin hiss of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the escaping gas, and was once more able to breathe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again he slipped into oblivion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He awoke with the sensation that infinite time had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed. He sat up quickly, feeling strong, alert, fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovered in every faculty, a clear memory of every de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail of the disastrous encounter with the strange blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe-ship springing instantly to his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was in a clean bed in a little white-walled room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Brand, a surprised grin on his bluff, rough-hewn</seg><seg type="columnLine">features, was sitting upon another bed beside him. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">attendants in white uniform stood just inside the door;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a nervous little man in black suit, evidently a doctor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hastily replacing gleaming instruments in a leather</seg><seg type="columnLine">bag.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A tall man appeared suddenly in the door, clad in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking uniform of black, scarlet, and gold--black</seg><seg type="columnLine">trousers, scarlet military coat and cap, gold buttons and</seg><seg type="columnLine">decorations. He carried in his hand a glittering positive</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray pistol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen," he said in a crisp, gruff voice, "you may</seg><seg type="columnLine">consider yourselves prisoners of the Prince of Space."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How come?"

Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the door was a round shaft, with a ladder through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">its length. Captain Smith clambered up the ladder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brand and Bill swung up behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After an easy climb of fifty feet or so, they entered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">domed pilot-house, with vitrolite observation panels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescopes, maps and charts, and speaking tube--an ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rangement similiar to that of the Fury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Black, star-strewn heavens lay before them.

Pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently a little black point came against the silver haze of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Milky Way.

The cylinder whirls constantly, with such speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the centrifugal force against the sides equals the</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of gravity on the earth. The city is built around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inside of the cylinder--so that one can look up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">see his neighbor's house apparently upside down, a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">above his head. We enter through a lock in one end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinder."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A vast disk of dull black metal was now visible a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards outside the vitrolite panels.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red Rover moved into the chamber, the mighty valve</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed behind her, air hissed in about her, an inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">valve was opened, and she slipped into the City of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were, Bill saw, at the center of an enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder. The sides, half a mile away, above and below</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, were covered with buildings along neat, tree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bordered streets, scattered with green lawns, tiny gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dens, and bits of wooded park. It seemed very strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Bill, to see these endless streets about the inside of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube, so that one by walking a little over three miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one direction would arrive again at the starting point,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same way that one gets back to the starting point</seg><seg type="columnLine">after going around the earth in one direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At the ends of the cylinder, fastened to the huge metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">878</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">disks, which closed the ends, were elaborate and complex</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanisms, machines strange and massive. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be for heating the city," Bill thought, "and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">purifying the air, for furnishing light and power, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps even for moving it about." The lock through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had entered was part of this mechanism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the center of each end of the cylinder hung a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, seeming large and round as the sun, flooding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place with brilliant mellow rays.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There are five thousand people here," said Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith. "The Prince has always kept the best specimens</seg><seg type="columnLine">among his captives, and others have been recruited be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides. We are self-sustaining as the earth is. We use</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power of the sun--through our vitalium batteries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We grow our own food. We utilize our waste products--</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter here goes through a regular cycle of life and</seg><seg type="columnLine">death as on the earth. Men eat food containing carbon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe in oxygen, and breathe out carbon dioxide; our</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants break up the carbon dioxide, make more foods</seg><seg type="columnLine">containing the same carbon, and give off the oxygen for</seg><seg type="columnLine">men to breathe again. Our nitrogen, or oxygen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydrogen, go through similar cycles. The power of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun is all we need from outside."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Smith guided his "guests" down the ladder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and out through the ship's airlock. They entered an ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vator. Three minutes later they stepped off upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the great cylinder that housed the City, and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered a low building with a broad concrete road curving</seg><seg type="columnLine">up before it. As they stepped out, it gave Bill a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">dizzy feeling to look up and see busy streets, inverted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mile above his head. The road before them curved</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothly up on either hand, bordered with beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, until its ends met again above his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The centrifugal force that held objects against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides of the cylinder acted in precisely the same way as</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity on the earth--except that it pulled away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the cylinder, instead of toward it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A glistening heliocar came skimming down upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling heliocopters, dropped to rubber tires, and rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up beside them. A young man of military bearing, clad</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a striking uniform of red, black, and gold, stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, saluted stiffly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Captain Smith," he said, "the Prince desires your at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendance at his private office immediately with your</seg><seg type="columnLine">guests."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Smith motioned Bill and Captain Brand into the richly</seg><seg type="columnLine">upholstered body of the heliocar. Bill, gazing up at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the huge cylinder with a city inside it, caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight, for the first time, of the exterior of the Red Rover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship that had brought them to the City of Space. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay just beside the massive machinery of the air-lock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">supported in a heavy metal cradle, with the elevator tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">running straight from it to the building behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look, Brand!" Bill gasped. "That isn't the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe. It isn't the ship we fought at all!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brand looked. The Red Rover was much the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of ship that the Fury had been. She was slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tapering, cigar-shaped, some two hundred feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length and twenty-five in diameter--nearly twice as</seg><seg type="columnLine">large as the Fury. She was cylindrical, instead of octa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gonal, and she mounted twenty-four motor tubes, in two</seg><seg type="columnLine">rings fore and aft, of twelve each, instead of eight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brand turned to Smith. "How's this?" he demanded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where is the blue globe? Did you have two ships?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A smile flickered over Smith's stern face. "You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a revelation waiting for you. But it is better not to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Prince waiting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They stepped into the heliocar. The pilot sprang to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his place, set the electric motors whirring. The ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine rolled easily forward, took the air on spinning heli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">copters. The road, lined with green gardens and bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">cottages, dropped away "below" them, and other houses</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew nearer "above." In the center of the cylinder the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man dextrously inverted the flier; and they con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued on a straight line toward an imposing concrete</seg><seg type="columnLine">building which now seemed "below."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE heliocar landed; they sprang out and ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached the imposing building of several stories.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guards uniformed in scarlet, black and gold standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">just outside the door held ray pistols in readiness. Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried his "guests" past; they entered a long, high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceilinged room. It gave a first impression of stately</seg><seg type="columnLine">luxury. The walls were paneled with rich dark wood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung with a few striking paintings. It was almost empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of furniture; a heavy desk stood alone toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther end. A tall young man rose from behind this</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk, advanced rapidly to meet them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "My guests, sir," said Smith. "Captain Brand of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fury, and a reporter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The mysterious Mr. Cain!" Bill gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Indeed, Mr. Cain stood before him, a tall man, slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wiry, with a certain not unhandsome sternness in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dark face. A smile twinkled in his black, enigmatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes--which none the less looked as if they might easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash with fierce authority.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And Mr. Win-or, I believe you asked me to call</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you Bill. You seem a very hard man to evade!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Still smiling enigmatically, Mr. Cain took Bill's hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then shook hands with Captain Brand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But--are you the Prince of Space?" Bill demanded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am. Cain was only a nom de guerre, so to speak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gentlemen, I welcome you to the City of Space!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you kidnaped yourself?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My men brought the Red Rover for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Dr. Trainor and his daughter-" Bill ejaculated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are friends of mine. They are here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that blue globe!" said Captain Brand. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You saw the course it was following?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It was headed to intersect the orbit of the earth--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its direction was on a line that cuts the orbit of Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">where that planet was forty days ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Prince turned to Bill. "And you have seen some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like that blue globe before?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, yes. The little blue circle on Mars--that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw through the great telescope on Trainor's Tower."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A sober smile flickered across the dark lean face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Prince.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then, gentlemen, you should believe me. The earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">is threatened with a dreadful danger from Mars. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue globe that wrecked your fleet was a ship from Mars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was another Martian flier that took the Helicon. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe I have credit for that ghastly exploit of sucking</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the passengers' blood." His smile became grimly</seg><seg type="columnLine">humorous. "One of the consequences of my position."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Martian fliers?" echoed Captain Brand. "Then how</seg><seg type="columnLine">did we come to be on your ship?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I haven't any weapon that will meet those purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic bombs on equal terms--though we are now work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out a new device. I had Smith cruising around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue globe in our Red Rover to see what he could learn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was investigating the wrecks, and found yau alive."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You really mean that men from Mars have come this</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PRINCE OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">879</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">near the earth?" Captain Brand was frankly incredulous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not men," the Prince corrected, smiling. "But things</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Mars have done it. They have already landed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, in fact."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned to the desk, picked up a broad sheet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cardboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have a color photograph here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill studied it, saw that it looked like an aerial pho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tograph of a vast stretch of mountain and desert, a mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">otonous expanse of gray, tinged with green and red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A photograph, taken from space, of part of the state</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Chihuahua, Mexico. And see!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed to a little blue disk in the green-gray ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panse of a plain, just below a narrow mountain ridge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the fine green line that marked a river just beside it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That blue circle is the first ship that came. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the things aboard it that sucked the blood out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people on the Helicon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Brand was staring at the tall, smiling man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a curious expression on his red, square-chinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Suddenly he spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your Highness, or whatever we must call you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just call me Prince. Cain is not my name. Once I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a name--but now I am nameless!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thin dark face suddenly lined with pain, the lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed in a narrow line. The Prince swept a hand across</seg><seg type="columnLine">his high forehead, as if to sweep something unpleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Prince, I'm with you. That is, if you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">an officer from the Moon Patrol." A sheepish smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">overspread his bluff features. "I would have killed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man for suggesting that I would ever do such a thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I'll fight for you as well as I ever did for the honor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Patrol."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks, Brand!" The Prince took his hand, smil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Count me in too, of course," said Bill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Both of you will be valuable men," said the Prince.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He picked up a sheaf of papers, scanned them quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to mark off one item from a sheet and add</seg><seg type="columnLine">another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Red Rover sets out for the earth in one hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentlemen. We're going to try a surprise attack on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue globe in the desert. You will both go aboard."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And I'm going too!" A woman's voice, soft and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little husky, spoke beside them. Recognizing it, Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to see Paula Trainor standing behind them, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager smile on her elfinly beautiful face. Her amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were fixed upon the Prince, their brown depths</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled, for the moment, with passionate wistful yearn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, no, Paula," the Prince said. "It's dangerous!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tears swam mistily in the golden orbs. "I will go!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must! I must!" The girl cried out the words, a sobbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch in her voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well, then," the Prince agreed, smiling absently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You father will be along of course. But anything will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be likely to happen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you will be there in danger, too!" cried the girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We start in an hour," said the Prince. "Smith, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may take Brand and Windsor back aboard the Red</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rover."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Curse his fatherly indifference!" Bill muttered under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his breath as they walked out through the guarded door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Can't he see that she loves him ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith must have heard him, for he turned to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke confidentially. "The Prince is a determined mis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ogynist. I think an unfortunate love affair was what</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruined his life--back on the earth. He left his history,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even his name, behind him. I think a woman was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. He won't look at a woman now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were outside again, startled anew by the amaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing scene of a street of houses and gardens, that curved</seg><seg type="columnLine">evenly up on either side of them and met above, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were moving about, head downward directly above</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The heliocar was waiting. The three got aboard, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted and swiftly carried to the slender silver cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Red Rover, where it hung among the ponderous</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery of the air-lock, on the end of the huge cy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">linder that housed the amazing City of Space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will show you your rooms," said Captain Smith.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And in an hour we are off to attack the Martians in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexico."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Vampires in the Desert</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FORTY hours later the Red Rover entered the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere of the earth, above northern Mexico.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was night, the desert was shrouded in blackness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The telescopes revealed only the lights at ranches scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered as thinly as they had been two centuries before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill was in the bridge-room, with Captain Smith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The blue globe that destroyed your fleet has already</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed here," Smith said. "We saw both of them before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they slipped 'into the shadow of night. They were right ,</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, and it seems that a white metal building has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been set up between them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Prince means to attack? In spite of those purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic bombs?" Bill seemed surprised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. They are below a low mountain ridge. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">land on the other side of the hill, a dozen miles off, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">give 'em a surprise at dawn."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'd better be careful," Bill said doubtfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They're more likely to surprise us. If you had been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of one of those little purple bombs, flying on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white ray!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have a sort of rocket torpedo that Doc Trainor</seg><seg type="columnLine">invented. The Prince means to try that on 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Red Rover dropped swiftly, with Smith's skilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands on the controls. It seemed but a few minutes until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark shadow of the earth beneath abruptly resolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself into a level plain scattered with looming shapes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were clumps of mesquite and sagebrush. The slim</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver cylinder came silently to rest upon the desert, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath stars that shone clearly, though to Bill they seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim in comparison with the splendid wonders of space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three hours before dawn, five men slipped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air-lock. The Prince himself was the leader,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Captains Brand and Smith, Bill, and a young officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Walker. Each man carried a searchlight and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">positive ray pistol. And strapped upon the back of each</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a rocket torpedo--a smooth, white metal tube, four</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet long and as many inches thick, weighing some eighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Trainor, kindly, bald-headed old scientist, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">left in charge of the ship. He and his daughter came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the air-lock into the darkness, to bid the five</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventurers farewell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'We should be back by night," said the Prince, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">even white teeth flashing in the darkness. "Wait for us</seg><seg type="columnLine">until then. If we don't come, return at once to the City</seg><seg type="columnLine">880</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of Space. I want no one to follow us, and no attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">made to rescue us if we don't come back. If we aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">back by tomorrow night we shall be dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very good, sir," Trainor nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm coming with you, then," Paula declared suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Absolutely you are not!" cried the Prince. "Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trainor, I command you not to let your daughter off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship until we return."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paula turned quickly away, a slim pillar of misty</seg><seg type="columnLine">white in the darkness. Bill heard a little choking sound;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew that she had burst into tears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't let you go off into such danger, without me!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she cried, almost hysterical. "I can't!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Prince swung a heavy torpedo higher on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders, and strode off over-bare gravel toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">low rocky slope of the mountain that lay to northward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly revealed in the light of the stars. The other four</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed silently. The slender sunship, with the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist and his sobbing daughter outside the air-lock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly vanished behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With only an occasional cautious flicker of the flash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights the five men picked their way over bare hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, among scattered clumps of mesquite. Presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">they crossed a barren lava bed, clambering over huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocks of twisted black volcanic rock. Up the slope of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain they struggled, sweating under heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">burdens, blundering into spiky cactus, stumbling over</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulders and sagebrush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the silver and rose of dawn came in the purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastern sky, the five lay on bare rock at the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">low ridge, overlooking the flat, mesquite-covered valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond. The valley floor was a brownish green in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of morning, the hills that rose far across it a hazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue-gray, faintly tinged with green on age-worn slopes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a string of emeralds dropped down the valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay an endless wandering line of cottonwoods, of a light</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vivid green that stood out from the somber plain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These trees traced the winding course of a stream, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rio Casas Grandes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lying against the cottonwoods, and rising above their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tops, were two great spheres of blue, gleaming like twin</seg><seg type="columnLine">globes of lapis lazuli in the morning light. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not far apart, and between them rose a curious domed</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure of white, silvery metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each of the five men lifted his heavy metal tube,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leveled it across a boulder before him. The Prince,</seg><seg type="columnLine">alert and smiling despite the dust and stain of the march</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the desert, spoke to the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This little tube along the top of the torpedo is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescope sight. You will peer through, get the cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairs squarely upon your target, and hold them there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then press this nickeled lever. That starts the projectile</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside the case to spinning so that inertia will hold it</seg><seg type="columnLine">true. Then, being certain that the aim is correct, press</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red button. The torpedo is thrown from the case by</seg><seg type="columnLine">compressed air, and a positive ray mechanism drives it</seg><seg type="columnLine">true to the target. When it strikes, about fifty pounds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Trainor's new explosive, trainite, will be set off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Walker, you and Windsor take the right globe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith and Brand, the left. I'll have a shot at that pecu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liar edifice between them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill balanced his torpedo, peered through the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope, and pressed the lever. The hum of a motor came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the heavy tube.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All ready?" the Prince inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ready," each man returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fire!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill pressed the red button. The tube drove heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward in his hands, and then was but a light, sheet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal shell. He saw a little gleam of white light before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, against the right blue globe, a diminishing point. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the motor ray that drove the torpedo speeding to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward its mark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GREAT flares of orange light hid the two azure</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres and the white dome between them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres and the dome crumpled and vanished, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin haze of bluish smoke swirled about them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good shooting!" the Prince commented. "This motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">torpedo of Trainor's ought to put a lot of the old fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing equipment in the museum--if we were disposed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bestow such a dangerous toy upon humanity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But let's get over and see what happened."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grasping ray pistols, they sprang to their feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged down the rocky slope. It was five miles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river. Nearly two hours later it was, when the five</seg><seg type="columnLine">men slipped out of the mesquites, to look two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards across an open, grassy flat to the wall of green</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees along the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three great heaps of wreckage lay upon the flat. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right and the left were crumpled masses of bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver metal--evidently the remains of the globes. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center was another pile of bent and twisted metal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been the domed building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Funny that those blue globes look like ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">white metal now," said Smith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder if the blue is not some sort of etheric</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen?" Brand commented. "When we were fighting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our rays seemed to take no effect. It occurred to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some vibratory wall might have stopped them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's possible," the Prince agreed. "I'll take up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibilities with Trainor. If they have such a screen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might even be opaque to gravity. Quite a convenience</seg><seg type="columnLine">in maneuvering a ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they spoke, they were advancing cautiously, stop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping to pick up bits of white metal that had been scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered about by the explosion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Bill's eyes caught movement from the pile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of crumpled metal that had been the white dome. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed that a green plant was growing quickly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the ruins. Green tendrils shot up amazingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he saw on the end of a twisted stalk a glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple thing that looked somehow like an eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first sight of the thing he had stopped in amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, leveling his deadly ray pistol and shouting, "Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the shout had died in his throat, before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others had time to turn their heads, they caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash of metal among the twining green tentacles. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was lifting a metal object.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Bill saw a tiny purple spark dart from a bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">little mechanism that the green tendrils held. He saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinding flash of violet light. His consciousness was cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">off abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next he knew he was lying on his back on rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil. He felt considerably bruised and battered, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right eye was swollen so that he could not open it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Struggling to a sitting position, he found his hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet bound by bloody manacles of unfamiliar design.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Brand was lying on his elbow beside him, half</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the thin shade of a mesquite bush. Brand looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">much torn and disheveled; blood was streaming across</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face from a gash in his scalp. His hands and feet also</seg><seg type="columnLine">were bound with fetters of white metal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PRINCE OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">881</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What happened?" Bill called dazedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not so loud," Brand whispered. "The thing--a Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tian left alive, I guess it is. Must have been somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in the brush when we shot. It blew us up with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic bomb. Smith and Walker dead--blown to pieces,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And the Prince?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can speak for myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hearing the familiar low voice, Bill turned. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Prince squatted down, in the blazing sunshine, hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feet manacled, hat off and face covered with blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Was it that--that green thing?" Bill asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks like a sort of animated plant," said the Prince.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A bunch of green tentacles, that it uses for hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three purple eyes on green stalks. Just enough of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">body to join it all together. Not like anything I ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw. But the Martians, originating under different con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditions, ought to be different."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is going to happen now ?" Bill inquired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Probably it will suck our blood--as it did to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers of the Helicon," Brand suggested grimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Windsor fell silent. It was almost noon. The desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun was very hot. The motionless air was oppressive</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a dry, parching heat; and flies buzzed annoyingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his bleeding cuts. Wrists and ankles ached under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cruel pressure of the manacles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'Wish the thing would come back, and end the sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pense," Brand muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill reflected with satisfaction that he had no relatives</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be saddened by his demise. He had no great fear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. Newspaper work in the twenty-second century</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not all commonplace monotony; your veteran re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porter is pretty well inured to danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Glad I haven't anyone to worry about me," he ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So am I," the Prince said bitterly. "I left them all,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you have someone!" Bill cried. "It isn't my</seg><seg type="columnLine">business to say it, but that makes no difference now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And you're a fool not to know. Paula Trainor loves</seg><seg type="columnLine">you! This will kil'l her!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Prince looked up, a bitter smile visible behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bloody grime on his thin dark face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Paula--in love with me! We're friends, of course.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But love! I used to believe in love. I have not been al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways a nameless outcast of space. Once I had name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">family--even wealth and position. I trusted my name</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my honor to a beautiful woman. I loved her! She</seg><seg type="columnLine">said she loved me--I thought she meant it. She used me</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a tool. I was trustful; she was clever."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dark eyes of the Prince burned in fierce anger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When she was through with me she left me to die</seg><seg type="columnLine">in disgrace. I barely escaped with my life. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbed me of my name, wealth, position. She named me</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outlaw. She made me appear a traitor to those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusted me--then laughed at me. She laughed at me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">called me a fool. I was--but I won't be again!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At first I was filled with anger at the whole world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the unjust laws and the silly conventions and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruel intolerance of men.

Struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately for power."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a few moments he was moodily silent, slapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the flies that buzzed around his bloody wounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I gained power. And I learned of the dangers from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars. First I was glad. Glad to see the race of man</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept out. Parasites men seemed. Insects. Life--what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">is it but a kind of decay on a mote in space? Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a saner view, and built the City of Space, to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few men. Then because the few seemed to have noble</seg><seg type="columnLine">qualities, I resolved to try to save the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it is too late.

Presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brand contrived, despite his manacles, to fish a packet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigarettes from his pocket, extract one, and tossed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others to Bill, who managed to light one for the Prince.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The three battered men sat in dazzling sun and blistering</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat, smoking and trying to forget heat and flies and</seg><seg type="columnLine">torturing manacles--and the death that loomed so near.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was early noon when Bill heard a little rustling</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the mesquites. In a moment the Martian ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared. A grotesque and terrifying being it was. Scores</seg><seg type="columnLine">of green tentacles, slender and writhing, grew from an</seg><seg type="columnLine">insignificant body. Three lidless, purple eyes, staring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">alien, and malevolent, watched them alertly from foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">long green stalks that rose above the body. The creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">half walked on tentacles extended below it, half dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself along by green appendages that reached out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp mesquite limbs above it. One inch-thick coil</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried a curious instrument of glittering crystal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">white metal--it was a strange, gleaming thing, remotely</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a ray pistol. And fastened about another tentacle</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a little metal ring, from which an odd-looking little</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar dangled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thing came straight for the Prince. Bill screamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a warning. The Prince saw it, twisted himself over</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ground, tried desperately to crawl away. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing reached out a slender tentacle, many yards long.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It grasped him about the neck, drew him back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment the dreadful being was crouching in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a writhing green mass above the body of the manacled</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Once he screamed piteously, then there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound save loud, gasping breaths. His muscles knotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he struggled in agony against the fetters and the coils</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the monster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill and Captain Brand lay there, unable either to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape or to give assistance. In silent horror they watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene. They saw that each slender green tentacle</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended in a sharp-edged suction disk. They watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disks forcing themselves against the throat of the agon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized man, tearing a way through his clothing to his body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They saw constrictions move down the rubber-like green</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentacles as if they were sucking, while red drops oozed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out about the edge of the disks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our turn next," muttered Captain Brand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And after us, the world!" Bill breathed, tense with</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A narrow, white beam, blindingly brilliant, flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from beyond the dull green foliage of the mesquite. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the crouching monster waveringly. Without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sound, it leapt, flinging itself aside from the body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Prince. It raised its curious weapon. A tiny purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">spark .darted from it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shattering crash rang out at a little distance. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a thin scream--a woman's scream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the white ray stabbed at the monster again, and'</seg><seg type="columnLine">it collapsed in a twitching heap of thin green coils, upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the still body of the Prince.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A slender girl rushed out of the brush, tossed aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">882</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a ray pistol, and flung' herself upon the monster, trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drag it from the Prince. It was Paula Trainor. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing was torn. Her skin was scratched and bleeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">from miles of running through the desert of rocks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cactus and thorny mesquite. She was evidently ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted. But she flung herself with desperate energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the rescue of the injured man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The body of the dead thing was light enough. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sucking disks still clung to the flesh. They pulled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore it when she tugged at them. She struggled des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perately to drag them loose, by turns sobbing and laugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hysterically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you can help us get loose, we might help," Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl raised a piteous face. "Oh, Mr. Bill--Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Brand! Is he dead ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think not, Miss Paula. The thing had just jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him. Buck up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See the little bar--it looks like a sliver of aluminum</seg><seg type="columnLine">--fastened to the metal ring about that coil?" Brand</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "It might be the key for these chains. End of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to be shaped about right. Suppose you try it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In nervous haste, the girl tore the little bar from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring. With Brand's aid, she was able to unlock his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fetters. The Captain lost no time in freeing Bill and</seg><seg type="columnLine">removing the manacles from the unconscious Prince.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thin, rubber-like tentacles could not be torn loose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brand cut them with his knife. He found them tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fibrous. Red blood flowed from them when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were severed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill carried the injured man down to the shade of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cottonwoods, brought water to him in a hat from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muddy little stream below. In a few minutes he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious, though weak from loss of blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Brand, after satisfying himself that Paula</seg><seg type="columnLine">had killed the Martian, and that it was the only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had survived in the wreckage of the blue globes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metal dome, set off to cross the mountain and bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">back the sunship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the Red Rover came into view late that eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, a beautiful slender bar of silver against the pyro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">technic gold and scarlet splendor of the desert sunset,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Prince of Space was hobbling about, supported on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill's arm, examining the wreckage of the Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">fliers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paula was hovering eagerly about him, anxious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid him. Bill noticed the pain and despair that clouded</seg><seg type="columnLine">her brown eyes. She had been holding the Prince's head</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her arms when he regained consciousness. Her lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been very close to his, and bright tears were brim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming in her golden eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill had seen the Prince push her away, then thank</seg><seg type="columnLine">her gruffly when he had found what she had done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Paula, you have done a great thing for the world,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill had heard him say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It wasn't the world at all! It was for you!" the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">had cried, tearfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had turned away, to hide her tears. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prince had said nothing more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Red Rover landed beside the wreckage of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian fliers. After a few hours spent in examining</seg><seg type="columnLine">and photographing the wrecks, in taking specimens of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white alloy of which they were built, and of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">substances used in the construction, they all went back</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the sunship, taking the dead Martian and other ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects for further study. Brand took off for the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Captain Brand," the Prince said as they stood in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridge room, "since the death of poor Captain Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">this morning, I believe you are the most skillful sunship</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer in my organization.

The man looked understanding^ at Bill, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded toward the elevator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In half an hour Bill was exhibiting his package and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his manuscript to the night editor of the Herald-Sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The greatest news in the century!" he cried. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth attacked by Mars! It was a Martian ship that</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the Helicon. I have one of the dead creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Mars in this box."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The astounded editor formed a quick opinion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his star reporter had met with some terrifying expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PRINCE OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">883</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rience that had unsettled his brain. He listened skepti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally while Bill related a true enough account of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruise of the Moon Patrol ships, and of the battle with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue globe. Bill omitted any mention of the City of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Space and its enigmatic ruler; but let it be assumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Fury had rammed the globe and that it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen in the desert. He ended with a wholly fictitious</seg><seg type="columnLine">account of how a mysterious scientist had picked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in a sunship, had told him of the invaders from Mars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had sent him to collect two tons of vitalium to</seg><seg type="columnLine">equip his ship for a raid on Mars. Bill had spent many</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours in planning his story; he was sure that it sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">as plausible as the amazing reality of the Prince of Space</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his wonderful city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The skeptical editor was finally convinced, as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his faith in Bill's probity as by the body of the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster, the scraps of a strange white metal, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">photographs, which he presented as material evidence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The editor radioed to have a plane sent from El Paso,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Texas, to investigate the wrecks. When it was reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were just as Bill,had said, the Herald-Sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">issued an extra, which carried Bill's full account, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">photographs of the dead monster, and scientific accounts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the other evidence. There was an appeal for two tons</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vitalium, to enable the unknown scientist to save the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world by making a raid on Mars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The story created an enormous sensation all over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. A good many people believed it. The Herald-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sun actually received half a million eagles in subscrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions to buy the vitalium--a sum sufficient to purchase</seg><seg type="columnLine">about eleven ounces of that precious metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most of the world laughed. It was charged that Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">was insane. It was charged that the Herald-Sun was at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempting to expand its circulation by a baseless canard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Worse, it was charged that Bill, perhaps in complicity</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the management of the great newspaper, was mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the discovery of a new sort of creature in some far</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of the world the basis for a gigantic fraud, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure that vast amount of vitalium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Examination proved that the wrecks in the desert had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been demolished by explosion instead of by falling. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">court injunction was filed against the Herald-Sun to pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent collection of the subscriptions, and Bill might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been arrested, if he had not wisely retired to Tr'ainor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, it was charged that the pirate, the Prince of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Space, was at the bottom of it--possibly the charge was</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested by the fact that the chief object of the Prince's</seg><seg type="columnLine">raids had always been vitalium. A rival paper asserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the pirate must have captured Bill and sent him</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to Earth with this fraud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Public excitement became so great that the reward for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the capture of Prince of Space, dead or alive, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised from ten to fifteen million eagles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twenty-four hours later after he had been landed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trainor's Tower, Bill was waiting there again, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright stars above him, and the carpet of fire that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York spread in great squares beneath him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">slim silver ship came gliding down, and hung just be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the vitrolite dome while eager hands helped him</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air-lock. Beyond, he found the Prince</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting, with a question in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No luck," Bill grunted hopelessly. "Nobody believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. And the town was getting too hot for me. Lucky</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had a getaway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Prince smiled bitterly as the newspaperman told</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his attempt to enlist the aid of humanity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About what I expected," he said. "Men will act like</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. It might be better, in the history of the cosmos, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">let the Martians have this old world. They might make</seg><seg type="columnLine">something better of it. But I am going to give human-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity a chance--if I can. Perhaps man will develop into</seg><seg type="columnLine">something better, in a million years."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'Then there is still a chance--without the vitalium?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill asked eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not without vitalium. We have to go to Mars. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have the metal to fit our flier for the trip. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have needed vitalium before; when I could not buy it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I took it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean--piracy!" Bill gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Am I not the Prince of Space--'notorious inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetary outlaw' as you have termed me in your paper?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And is not the good of the many more than the good</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the few? May I not take a few pounds of metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a rich corporation, to save the earth for humanity ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I told you to count me in," said Bill. "The idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just a little revolutionary."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We haven't wasted any time while you were in New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York. I have means of keeping posted on the shipments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vitalium from the moon. We have found that the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship Triton leaves the moon in about twenty hours, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">three months production of the vitalium mines in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kepler crater. It should be well over two tons."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THIRTY hours later the Red Rover was drifting at</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest in the lunar lane, with ray tubes dead and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">light showing. Men at her telescopes scanned the heavens</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonward for sight of the white repulsion rays of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton and her convoy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill was with Captain Brand in the bridge-room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eager light flashed in Brand's eyes as he peered through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telescopes, watched his instruments, and spoke brisk</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders into the tube.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How does it feel to be a pirate?" Bill asked, "after</seg><seg type="columnLine">so many years spent hunting them down?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Brand grinned. "You know," he said, "I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to be a buccaneer ever since I was about four</seg><seg type="columnLine">years old. I couldn't, of course, so I took the next best</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, and hunted them. I'm not exactly grieving my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart out Over what has happened. But I feel sorry for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my old pals of the Moon Patrol. Somebody is going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get hurt!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And it may be we," said Bill. "The Triton will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">convoyed by several war-fliers, and she can fight with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own rays. It looks to me like a hard nut to crack."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I used to dream about how I would take a ship if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the Prince of Space," said Captain Brand. "I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">just been talking our course of action over with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We've agreed on a plan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In an hour the Prince and Dr. Trainor entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge. Paula appeared in a few moments. Her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was drawn and pale; unhappiness cast a shadow in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown eyes. Eagerly, she asked the Prince how he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, about as well as ever, thanks," the lean young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man replied in a careless voice. His dark, enigmatic eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell upon her face. He must have noticed her pallor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident unhappiness. He met her eyes for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then took a quick step toward her. Bill saw a great ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derness almost breaking past the bitter cynicism in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark eyes. Then the Prince checked himself, spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are preparing for action, Paula.

Captain Brand gave the order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two Moon Patrol sunships are ahead, cruising fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles apart," came the word from the telescope. "A hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred miles behind them is the Triton, with two more</seg><seg type="columnLine">Patrol fliers twenty-five miles behind her and fifty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brand spoke to the Prince, who nodded. And Brand</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Show no lights. Work the ship around with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gyroscopes until our rear battery of tubes will cover the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right Patrol ship of the leading pair, and our bow tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whir of the electric motors came from below. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fliers swung about, hanging still in the path of the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching Triton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All ready, sir," came a voice from the tube.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few anxious minutes went by. Then the Red</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rover, dark and silent, was hanging squarely between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two forward Patrol ships, about twenty-five miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">from each of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fire constantly with all tubes, fore and aft, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enemy appears to be disabled," Brand gave the order.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Prince spoke to him, and he added, "Inflict no un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary damage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dazzling white rays flashed from the tubes. Swiftly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they found the two forward sunships. The slender octa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gons of silver shone white under the rays. They reeled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled about, end over end, under the terrific pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of atomic bombardment. In a moment they glowed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull red incandescence, swiftly became white. A bluish</seg><seg type="columnLine">haze spread about them-- the discharge of the electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy carried by the atoms, which would electrocute</seg><seg type="columnLine">any man not insulated against it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the three other ships flaming white rays darted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching for the Red Rover. But they had hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the mark when Brand ordered his rays snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. The two vessels he had struck were but whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses of incandescent wreckage--completely out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle, though most of the men aboard them still sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vived in their insulated cells.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Prince himself spoke into the tube. "Maneuver</seg><seg type="columnLine">number forty-one. Drive for the Triton."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Driven by alternate burst from front and rear motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes, the Red Rover started a curiously irregular course</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the treasure ship. Spinning end over end, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribing irregular curves,, she must have been an almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible target.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And twice during each spin, when her axis was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">line with the Triton, all tubes were fired for an instant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking the treasure ship with a force that reeled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered her, leaving her plates half-fused, twisted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three times a ray caught the Red Rover for an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant, but her amazing maneuvers, which had evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">been long practised by her crew,' carried her on a course</seg><seg type="columnLine">so erratic and puzzling that the few rays that found her</seg><seg type="columnLine">were soon shaken off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the pirate flier reached the Triton, the treasure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel was drifting helpless, with all rays out. The Red</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rover passed by her, continuing on her dizzily whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">course until she was directly between the two remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">fliers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold her still," the Prince then shouted into the tube.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And fire all rays, fore and aft."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BLINDING opalescent rays jetted viciously from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two rings of tubes. Since the Red Rover lay be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the two vessels, they could not avoid firing upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other. Her own rays, being fired in opposite direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, served to balance each other and hold her at rest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the rays of the enemy, as well as those of the pi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate that impinged upon them, tended to send them into</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinning flight through space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blinding fluorescence obscured the vitrolite panels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the stout walls of the Red Rover groaned beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pressure of the hail of atoms upon them. Swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would heat, soften, collapse. Or the insulation</seg><seg type="columnLine">would burn away and the electric charge electrocute her</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The enemy was in a state as bad. The white beams</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pirate flier had found them earlier, and could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">held upon them more efficiently. It was a contest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">endurance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the jets of opalescence snapped off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pirate. Bill, gazing out into star-dusted space, saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two Patrol vessels spinning in mad flight before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure of the rays, glowing white in incandescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted ruin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few minutes later the Red Rover was drifting</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the Triton holding the wrecked treasure-flier with</seg><seg type="columnLine">electromagnetic plates. The air-lock of the pirate vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened to release a dozen men in metal vacuum suits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed with ray pistols and equipped with wrecking tools</seg><seg type="columnLine">and oxygen lances. The Prince was their leader.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They forced the air-lock of the Triton, and entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck. In a few minutes grotesque metal-suited figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared again, carrying heavy leaden tubes filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the precious vitalium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Red Rover was speeding into space, an hour later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under full power. The Prince of Space was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge room, with Bill, Captain Brand, Dr. Trainor, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paula. Bill noticed that the girl seemed pathetically</seg><seg type="columnLine">joyous at the Prince's safety, though he gave her scant</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have the two tons of vitalium," said the Prince.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nearly forty-six hundred pounds, in fact. Easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to furnish power for the voyage to Mars. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the metal--provided we can get away with it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is there still danger?" Paula inquired nervously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Most of the passengers of the Triton were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still alive. When I gave her captain my card, he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that they sent a heliographic S.O.S. as soon as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacked. Some forty or fifty fliers of the Moon Patrol</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be hot on our trail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Red Rover flew on into space, under all her</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. Presently the lookouts picked up a score of tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickering points of light behind them. The Moon Patrol</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in hot pursuit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Old friends of mine," said Captain Brand. "Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them would give his life to see us caught. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I suppose every one of them feels now that he has a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slice of that fifteen million eagles reward! The Moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Patrol never gives up and never admits defeat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tense, anxious hours went by while every battery</seg><seg type="columnLine">was delivering its maximum current, and every motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PRINCE OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">885</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tube was operating at its absolutely highest potential.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paula waited on the bridge, anxiously solicitous for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Prince's health--he was still pale and weak from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventure in the desert. Presently, evidently noticing</seg><seg type="columnLine">how tired and worried she looked, he sent her to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">stateroom to rest. She went, in tears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No chance to fight, if they run us down," said Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Brand. "We can handle four, but not forty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Time dragged heavily. The Red Rover flew out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, past the moon, on such a course as would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw pursuit toward the City of Space. Her maximum</seg><seg type="columnLine">acceleration was slightly greater than that of the Moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Patrol fliers, because of the greater number and power</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her motor tubes. Steadily she forged away from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the flickering lights behind could be seen no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the Red Rover continued in a straight line, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of her speed, for many hours, before she turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped cautiously toward the secret City of Space. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached it in safety, was let through the air-lock. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more Bill looked out upon the amazing city upon the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner wall of a spinning cylinder. Pie enjoyed the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markable experience of a walk along a street three miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">in length, which brought him up in an unbroken curve,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and back to where he had started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took a week to refit the Red Rover, in preparation</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the voyage to Mars. Her motor ray tubes were re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">built, and additional vitalium generators installed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">precious metal taken from the Triton was built into new</seg><seg type="columnLine">batteries to supply power for the long voyage. Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">stocks of food, water, and compressed oxygen were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken aboard, as well as weapons and scientific equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of all variety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We start for Mars in thirty minutes," Captain Brand</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Bill when the warning gong had called him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others aboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Red Star of War</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Red Rover slipped out through the great aii'-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock of the City of Space, and put her bow toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars.

Is there</seg><seg type="columnLine">much danger?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A good deal. The meteorites travel in swarms which</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow regular orbits about the sun. We have accurate</seg><seg type="columnLine">charts of the swarms whose orbits cross those of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">earth and moon. Now we are entering unexplored terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory. And most of them are so small, of course, that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescope would reveal them in time. Merely little peb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bles, moving with a speed about a dozen times that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bullet from an old-fashioned rifle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what are we going to do if we live to get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A big question!" Brand grinned. "We could hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">mop up a whole planet with the motor rays. Trainor</seg><seg type="columnLine">has a few of his rocket torpedoes, but not enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make much impression upon a belligerent planet. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prince and Trainor have a laboratory rigged up down</seg><seg type="columnLine">below. They are doing a lot of work. A new weapon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I understand. I don't know what will come of it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently Bill found his way down the ladder to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory. He found the Prince of Space and Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trainor hard at work. He learned little by watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, save that they were experimenting upon small</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals, green plants, and samples of the rare vitalium.</seg><seg type="columnLine">High tension electricity, electron tubes, and various</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays seemed to be in use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Noticing his interest, the Prince said, "You know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">vitalium was first discovered in vitamins, in infinitesimal</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantities. The metal seems to be at the basis of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. It is the trace of vitalium in chlorophyl which en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ables the green leaves of plants to utilize the energy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight. We are trying to determine the nature of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">essential force of life--we know that the question is</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound up with the radioactivity of vitalium. We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a good deal of progress, and complete success</seg><seg type="columnLine">would give us a powerful instrumentality."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paula was working with them in the laboratory, mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a capable and eager assistant--she had been her</seg><seg type="columnLine">father's helper since her girlhood. Bill noticed that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed happy only when near the Prince, that the weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unhappiness and trouble left her brown eyes only</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she was able to help him with some task, or when</seg><seg type="columnLine">her skill brought a word or glance of approval from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Prince himself seemed entirely absorbed in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">work; he treated the girl courteously enough, but seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether impersonal toward her. To him, she seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to be a fellow-scientist. Yet Bill knew that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prince was aware of the girl's feelings--and he suspect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed that the Prince was trying to stifle a growing re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciprocal emotion of his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill spent long hours on the bridge with Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brand, staring out at the star-scattered midnight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. The earth shrank quickly, until it was a tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">green disk, with the moon an almost invisible white</seg><seg type="columnLine">speck beside it. Day by day, Mars grew larger. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">swelled from an ocher point to a little red disk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Often Bill scanned the spinning scarlet globe through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a telescope. He could see the white polar caps, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark equatorial regions, the black lines of the canals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And after many days, he could see the little blue circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been visible in the giant telescope on Trainor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It must be something enormous, to stand out so</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly," he said when he showed it to Captain Brand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose so. Even now, we could see nothing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a diameter of less than a mile or so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it's a ship, it must be darned big--big enough for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole race of 'em to get aboard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill was standing, a few hours later, gazing out</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the vitrolite panels at the red-winged splendor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun, when suddenly he heard a series of terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashes. The ship rocked and trembled beneath him; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">886</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the reverberation of hammered metal, and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hiss of escaping air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Meteorite!" screamed Brand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wildly, he pointed to the vitrolite dome above. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">three places the heavy crystal was shattered, a little hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">drilled through it, surrounded with radiating cracks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In two other sections the heavy metal wall was dented.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the holes, the air was hissing out. It formed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white cloud outside, and glistening frost gathered quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the crystal panels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill felt the air suddenly drawn from his lungs. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped for breath. The bridge was abruptly cold. Little</seg><seg type="columnLine">particles of snow danced across it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The air is going!" Brand gasped. "We'll suffocate!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He touched a lever and a heavy cover fell across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladder shaft, locked itself, making the floor an airtight</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulkhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right," Bill tried' to say. "Give others--</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice had failed. A soaring came in his ears. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt as if a malignant giant were sucking out his breath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The room grew dark, swam about him. He reeled; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was blind. A sudden chill came over his limbs--the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finite cold of space. He felt hot blood spurting from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nose, freezing on his face. Faintly he heard Brand</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving, as he staggered and fell into unconsciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN he looked about again, air and warmth were</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming back. He saw that the shaft was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">sealed, but air was hissing into the room through a valve.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Brand lay inert beside him on the floor. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up at the dome, saw that soft rubber patches had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been placed over the holes, where air-pressure held them</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast. The Captain had saved the ship before he fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment the door opened. Dr. Trainor rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, with Prince and others behind him. They picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unconscious Brand and rushed him down to the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmary. The plucky captain had been almost asphy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">xiated, but administration of pure oxygen restored him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to consciousness. On the following day he was back on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Red Rover had been eighteen days out from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">City of Space. The loss of air due to collision with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteorites had brought inconveniences, but good prog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ress had been made. It was only two more days to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars. The forward tubes had been going many hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to retard the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Object dead ahead!" called a lookout from his tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A small blue globe, coming directly toward us," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">added, a moment later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another of their ships, setting out for the earth,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brand muttered. "It will about cook our goose!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few moments the Prince and Dr. Trainor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed up the ladder from the laboratory. The blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe was rushing swiftly toward them; and the Red</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rover was plunging forward at many thousand miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">per hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can't run from it," said Brand. "It is still fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand miles away, but we are going far too fast to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop in that distance. We will pass it in about five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we can't stop, we go ahead," the Prince said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling grimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We might try a torpedo on 'em," suggested Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trainor. He had mounted a tube to fire his rocket tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedoes from the bridge. It will have all the speed its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">own motor rays can develop, plus what the ship has at</seg><seg type="columnLine">present, plus the relative velocity of the globe. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">might carry it through."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Prince nodded assent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Trainor slipped a slender, gleaming rocket into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube, sighted it, moved the lever that set the projectile to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinning, and fired. The little white flame of the motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays dwindled and vanished ahead of them. Quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trainor fired again, and then a third time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Switch off the rays and darken the lights," the Prince</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered. "With combined speeds of ten thousand miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minute, we might pass them without being seen--if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they haven't sighted us already."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For long seconds they hurtled onward in tense silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill was at a telescope. Against the silver and black</seg><seg type="columnLine">background of space, the little blue disk of the Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was growing swiftly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly a bright purple spark appeared against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue, grew swiftly brighter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An atomic bomb!" he cried. "They saw us. We are</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tensed himself, waiting for the purple flash that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would mean the end But the words were hardly out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his mouth when he saw a tiny sheet of violet flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">far ahead of them. It flared up suddenly, and vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">as abruptly. The blue disk of the ship still hung before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, but the purple spark was gone. For a moment he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was puzzled. Then he understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The atomic bomb struck a torpedo!" he shouted. "It's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">exploded. And if they think it was we-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps they can't see us, with the rays out," Brand</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is unlikely," Trainor observed, "that the bomb ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tually struck one of our torpedoes. More likely it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">set to be detonated by the gravitational attraction of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">object that passed near it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still watching the azure globe, Bill saw a sudden flare</seg><seg type="columnLine">of orange light against it. A great burst of yellow flame.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 he blue ball crumpled behind the flame. The orange</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out, and the blue vanished with it. Only twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraps of white metal were left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The second torpedo struck the Martian!" Bill cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And you notice that the blue went out," said Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trainor. "It must be merely a vibratory screen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Red Rover hurtled on through space, toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimson planet that hour by hour and minute by minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">expanded before her. The blue disk was now plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible against the red. It was apparently a huge globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">of azure, similar to the ships they had met, but at least a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile in diameter. She lay just off the red desert, near</seg><seg type="columnLine">an important junction of '"canals."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some huge machine, screened by the blue wall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibration," Dr. Trainor suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the last two days the Prince and Dr. Trainor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their eager assistant, Paula, had worked steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the laboratory, without pause for rest. Bill was with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them when the Prince threw down his pencil and an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced the result of his last calculation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The problem is solved," he said. "And its answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">means both success and failure. We have mastered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret of life. We have unlocked the mystery of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages! A terrific force is at our command--a force great</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to sweep man to the millennium, or to wipe out</seg><seg type="columnLine">a planet! But that force is useless without the appara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tus to release it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have the laboratory-" Trainor began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we lack one essential thing. We must have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PRINCE OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">887</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">small amount of cerium, one of the rare earth metals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the electrode, you know, inside the vitalium grid</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our new vacuum tube. And there is not a gram of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerium in all our supplies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can go back to the Earth-" said Trainor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That will mean forty days gone, before we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">come back--more than forty, because we would have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop at the City of Space to refit. And all the perils of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meteorites again. I am sure that in less than forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">days the Martians will be putting the machine in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous blue globe to its dreadful use."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then we must land on Mars and find the metal!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Captain Brand, who had been listening by the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly," said the Prince. "You will pick out a spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">that looks deserted, at a great distance from the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe. Somewhere in the mountains, as far back as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible from the canals. Land there just after midnight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We will have mining and prospecting equipment ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go to work when day comes. Almost any sort of ore</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to yield the small quantity of cerium we need."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Very good, sir," said Brand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A FEW hours later the Red Rover was sweeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Mars, on a long curve, many thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from the surface of the red planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll pick out the spot to land while the sun is shin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning on it," Captain Brand told Bill. "Then we can keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">over it, as it sweeps around into the shadow, timing our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves to land just after midnight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Isn't there danger tliat we may be seen?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course. We can only minimize it by keeping a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few thousand miles above the surface as long as it is day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and landing at night, and in a deserted section."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they drew nearer, the telescope revealed the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the hostile planet more distinctly. Bill peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">intently into an eyepiece, scanning the red globe for signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it malignant inhabitants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The canals seem to be strips of greenish vegetation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">irrigated from some sort of irrigation system that brings</seg><seg type="columnLine">water from the melting ice-caps," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lowell, the old American astronomer, knew that two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred years ago," said Captain Brand, "though some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his contemporaries claimed that they could not see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'canals.' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can make out low green trees, and metal structures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think there are long pipes, as well as open channels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to spread the water. And I see a great dome of white</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal--it must be five hundred feet across. . . . There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are several of them in sight, mostly located where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canals intersect."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They might be great community buildings--cities,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested Brand. "On account of the dust-storms that</seg><seg type="columnLine">so often hide the surface of the planet, it would probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">be necessary to cover a city up in some way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"And I see something moving. A little blue dot, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems. Probably a little flier on the same order as those</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have seen; but only a few feet in diameter. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be sailing from one of the white domes to another."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brand moved to another telescope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I see them. Two in one place. They seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be floating along, high and fast. And just to the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a whole line of them, flying one behind the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crossing a patch of red desert."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's this ?" Bill cried in some excitement. "Looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">like animals of some kind in a pen. They look like</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, almost."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What! Let me see!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brand rushed over from his telescope. Bill relin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quished him the instrument. "See. Just above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the field. Right in the edge of that cultivated</seg><seg type="columnLine">strip, by what looks like a big aluminum water-pipe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Yes, I see something. A big stockade. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">it has things in it. But not men, I think. They are gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hairy. But they seem to walk on two legs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something like apes, maybe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got it," cried Brand. "They're domestic ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals! The ruling Martians are parasites. They must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have something to suck blood out of. They live on these</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Probably so," Bill admitted. "Do you suppose they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will keep people penned up that way, if they conquer the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Likely." He shuddered. "No good in thinking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. We must be selecting the place to land."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He returned to his instrument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got it," he said presently. "A low mountain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a big sweep of red desert. About sixty degrees north</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the equator. Not a canal or a white dome in a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred miles."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long hours went by, while the Red Rover hung above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chosen landing place, waiting for it to sweep into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of night. Bill peered intently through his tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope, watching the narrow strips of vegetation across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bare stretches of orange desert. He studied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright metal and gray masonry of irrigation works, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">widely scattered, white metal domes that seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover cities, the hurtling blue globes that flashed in swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight between them. Two or three times he caught sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a tiny, creeping green thing that he thought was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hideous, blood-sucking Martians. And he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a dozen broad metal pens, or pastures, in which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairy gray bipeds were confined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shining machines were moving across the green strips</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fertile land, evidently cultivating them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Prince, Dr. Trainor, and Paula were asleep in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their staterooms. Bill retired for a short rest, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to find the planet beneath them in darkness. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red Rover was dropping swiftly, with Captain Brand</seg><seg type="columnLine">still at the bridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rapidly, the stars vanished in an expanding circle be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low them. Phobos and Deimos, the small moons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars, hurtling across the sky with different velocities</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed scant light upon the barren desert below.

The air was clear, and so thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the stars shone with hot brilliance, almost, Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, as if the ship were still out in space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silent hours went by, as they waited for dawn. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin white disk of the nearer moon slid down beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black eastern horizon, and rose again to make another</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtling flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just before dawn the Prince appeared, an eager smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his alert lean face, evidently well recovered from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, struggling in the laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've all the mining machinery ready," Captain Brand</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him.

"I am sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Envers landed on Mars--I think the Martian ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">are based on a study of his machinery."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Envers may have waited here in the desert for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun to rise, just as we are doing," murmured Brand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"In fact, if he wanted to look around without being seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he may have landed right near here.

Even from the eminence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the time-worn plateau, the straight horizon seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">far nearer than on earth, due to the greater curvature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet's surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men were gathering about the air-lock, under the di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection of the Prince, assembling mining equipment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shall we be able to go out without vacuum suits?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill asked Captain Brand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think so, when it gets warm enough. The air is</seg><seg type="columnLine">light--the amount of oxygen at the surface is about</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal to that in the air nine miles above sea level on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. But the pull of gravity here is only about one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">third as much as it is on the earth, and less oxygen will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be required to furnish energy. I think we can stand it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we don't take too much exertion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rays of the oddly small sun beat fiercely through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thin air. Soon the Prince went into the air-lock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the inner door behind him and started the pumps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the dial showed the pressures equalized he opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outer door, and stepped out upon the red rocks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All were watching him intently, through the vitrolite</seg><seg type="columnLine">panels. Paula clasped her hands in nervous anxiety.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill saw the Prince step confidently out, sniff the air as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though testing it, and take a few deep breaths. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew his legs beneath him and made an astounding leap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that carried him twenty feet high. He fell in a long arc,</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck on his shoulder in a pile of loose red sand. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">got up, gasping for air as if the effort had exhausted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and staggered back to the airlock. Quickly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sealed the outer door behind him, opened the valve, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised the pressure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Feels funny," he said when he opened the inner door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Like trying to breathe on top of a mountain--only more</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. The jump was great fun, but rather exhausting. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine it would be dangerous for a fellow with a weak</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. All right to come out now. Air is still cool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the rocks are getting hot under the sun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He held open the door. "The guards will come first."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Six of the thirty-odd members of the crew had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">detailed to act as guards, to prevent surprise. Each was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry two rocket torpedoes--such a burden was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much upon this planet, with its lesser gravity. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">would watch from the cliffs at the edge of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">plateau upon which the sunship had landed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill and four other men entered the air-lock--and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Paula. The girl had insisted upon having some duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">assigned to her, and this had seemed easier than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mining.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door was closed behind them, the air pumped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">until Bill gasped for breath and heard a drumming in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears. Then the outer door was opened and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked out upon Mars. Motion was easy, yet the slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est effort was tiring. Bill found himself panting merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the exertion of lifting the two heavy torpedoes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With Paula behind him, he stepped through the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. The air felt chill and thin. Loose red sand crum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled yieldingly under their feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They separated at the door, Bill starting toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">south end of the pleateau, Paula toward the north point,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the men going to stations along the sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just lie at the top of the cliffs and watch," the Prince</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ordered. "When you have anything to report, flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">with your ray pistols, in code. Signal every thirty min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes, anyhow. We will have a man watching from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge. Report to him anything moving. We will fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">off a red signal rocket when you are to come back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had tried to keep Paula from going out, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl had insisted. At last he had agreed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better to have you keeping watch than handling a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick and shovel, or pushing a barrow," he had told her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I hate to see you go so far off. Something might</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen. If they find us, though, they will probably get</seg><seg type="columnLine">us all. Don't get hurt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill had seen the Prince looking anxiously at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender, brown-eyed girl as they entered the air-lock. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen him move forward quickly, as though to ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to come back--move forward, and then turn aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a flush that became a bitterly cynical smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Bill walked across the top of the barren red</seg><seg type="columnLine">plateau, he looked back at the girl moving slowly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite direction. He had glanced at her eyes as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the ship. They were shadowed, heavy-lidded. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">their brown depths lurked despair and tragic determina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Bill, watching her now, thought that all life had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone out of her. She seemed a dull automaton, driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">only by the energy of a determined will. All hope and</seg><seg type="columnLine">life and vivacity had gone from her manner. Yet she</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked as if she had a stern task to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder-" Bill muttered. "Can she mean--sui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cide?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned uncertainly, as if to go after her. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">deciding that his thought was mere fancy, he trudged on</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the red plateau to his station.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind him, he saw other parties emerging from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-lock. The Prince and Dr. Trainor were setting up</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus of some kind, probably, Bill thought, to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetic and meteorological observations. Men with</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospecting hammers were scattering over all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plateau.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Almost any sort of ferruginous rock is sure to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain the tiny amount of cerium we need," Dr. Trainor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BILL reached the end of the plateau. The age-worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs of red granite and burned lava fell sheer for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred feet, to a long slope of talus. Below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubble of sand and boulders the flat desert stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, almost visibly curving to vanish beneath the near</seg><seg type="columnLine">red horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a desolate and depressing scene, this view of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead and sun-baked planet. There was no sign of living</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PRINCE OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">889</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, no moving object, no green of life--the canals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their verdure, were far out of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hard to realize there's a race of vampires across</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, living in great metal domes," Bill muttered, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw himself fiat on the rocks at the lip of the precipice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leveled one of the heavy torpedoes before him. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't blame 'em for wanting to go to a more cheerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking behind him, he soon saw men busy with elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tric drills not a hundred yards from the slender silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder that was the Red Rover. The earth quivered be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath him as a shot was set off, and he saw a great foun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain of crushed rock thrown into the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men with barrows, an hour later, were wheeling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed rock to gleaming electrical reducing apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Dr. Trainor and the Prince were setting up beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sunship. Evidently there had been no difficulty in</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding ore that carried a satisfactory amount of cerium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill continued to scan the orange-red desert below</seg><seg type="columnLine">him through the powerful telescope along the rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube. He kept his watch before him, and at half-hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervals sent the three short flashes with his ray pistol,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which meant "All is well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two hours must have gone by before he saw the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe. It came into view low over the red rim of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert below him, crept closer on a wavering path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Martian ship in view," he signalled. "A blue globe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about ten feet in diameter. Follows curious winding</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, as if following something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep rocket trained upon it," came the cautiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed reply. "Fire if it observes us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Globe following animals," he flashed back. "Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">grayish bipeds leaping before it. Running with marvel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous agility."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was peering through the telescope sight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket tube. Keeping the cross hairs upon the little blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe, he could still see the creatures that fled before it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were almost like men--or erect, hairy apes. Bi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peds, they were, with human-like arms, and erect heads.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Covered with short gray hair or fur, they carried no</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They fled from the globe at a curious leaping run,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which carried them over the flat red desert with remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able speed. They came straight for the foot of the cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which Bill watched, the blue globe close behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. When one of them stumbled over a block of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lava and fell sprawling headlong on the sand, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray creature stopped to help it. The blue globe stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, hanging still twenty feet above the red sand, waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them to rise and run desperately on again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill felt a quick flood of sympathy for the gray crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures. One had stopped to help the other. That meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they felt affection. And the globe had waited for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to run again. It seemed to be baiting them mali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciously. Almost he fired the rocket. But his orders had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been not to fire unless the ship were discovered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now they were not a mile away. Suddenly Bill per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived a tiny, light-gray object grasped close to the breast</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one of the gray bipeds. Evidently it was a young one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the arms of its mother. The other creature seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a male. It was the mother that had fallen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They came on toward the cliff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were very clearly in view, and not five hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards below, when the female fell again. The male</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped to aid her, and the globe poised itself above</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, waited. The mother seemed unable to rise. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other creature lifted her, and she fell limply back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if in rage, the gray male sprang toward the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe, crouching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A tiny purple spark leapt from it. A flash of violet</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire enveloped him. He was flung twisted and sprawl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the ground. Burned and torn and bleeding, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew himself to all fours, and crept on toward the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the sphere dropped to the ground. A round</seg><seg type="columnLine">panel swung open in its side--it was turned from Bill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that he could not see within. Green things crept out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were creatures like the one he had seen in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexican desert--a cluster of slender, flexible green</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentacles, with suction disks, an insignificant green body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and three malevolent purple eyes, at the ends of foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">long stalks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were three of the things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The creeping male flung himself madly upon one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. It coiled itself about him; suction disks fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves against his skin. For a time he writhed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled, fighting in agony against the squeezing green</seg><seg type="columnLine">coils. Then he was still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the things grasped the little gray object in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother's arms. She fought to shield it, to cover it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own body. It was torn away from her, hidden in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hideously writhing green coils.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The third of the monsters flung itself upon the mother,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapping snake-like tentacles about her, dragging her</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling body down shuddering and writhing in agony</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the blood of life was sucked from it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill watched, silent and trembling with horror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The things chased them--for fun!"**he muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiercely. "Just a sample of what it will be on the earth--</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we don't stop 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the green monsters left their victims--which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now mere shriveled husks. They dragged them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves back into the blue globe, which rose swiftly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air. The round panel had closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From his station on the cliff, Bill watched the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the telescope sight of the rocket, keeping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross hairs upon it. It came up to his own level--above</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Suddenly it paused. He was sure that the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it had seen the Red Rover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly, he pressed a little nickeled lever. A soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">whir came from the rocket tube. He pressed the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">button. The torpedo leapt forward, with the white rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving back. The empty shell was flung back in Bill's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A great burst of vivid orange flame enveloped the co-</seg><seg type="columnLine">balt globe. It disintegrated into a rain of white metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take that, damn you!" he muttered in fierce satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Globe brought down successfully," he flashed. "Evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently it had sighted us. Green Martians from it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed gray bipeds. May I inspect remains?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may," permission was flashed back from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prince. "But be absent not over half an hour."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment another message came. "All lookouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">be doubly alert. Globe may be searched for. Miners</seg><seg type="columnLine">making good progress. We can leave by sunset. Cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age! -The Prince."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STRAPPING the remaining rocket torpedo to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders, and thrusting his ray pistol ready in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt, Bill walked back along the brink of the precipice</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he saw a comparatively easy way to the red plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, and scrambled over the rim. Erosion of untold</seg><seg type="columnLine">890</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ages had left cracks and irregularities in the rock. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of the slighter gravity of Mars, it was a simple feat</seg><seg type="columnLine">to support his weight with the grip of his fingers on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge. In five minutes he had clambered down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank of talus. Hurriedly he scrambled down over great</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen boulders, panting and gasping for breath in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reached the red sand of the plain--it was worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">by winds of ages into an impalpable scarlet dust, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose in a thin, murky cloud about him, and settled in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-colored stain upon his perspiring limbs. The dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust yielded beneath his feet as he made his way to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the silent gray bodies, making his progress most</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost exhausted, he reached the gray creatures, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amined them. They were far different from human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings, despite obvious similarities. Each of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">"hands" had but three clawed digits; a curious, disk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like appendage took the place of the nose. In skeletel</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure they were far different from homo sapiens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wearily Bill trudged back to the towering red cliff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">red dust swirling up about him. He was oddly ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted by his exertions, trifling as they had been. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">murky red dust he inhaled was irritating to his nostrils;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he choked and sneezed. Sweat ran in muddy red streams</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his body, and he was suddenly very thirsty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the top of the red granite plateau--it was evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stone heart of an ancient mountain--was hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him. He could see nothing of the Red Rover or</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of her crew. He could see no living thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flat plain of red dust lay about him, curving below</seg><seg type="columnLine">a near horizon. Lbose dust sucked at his feet, rose about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in a suffocating saffron cloud. The sun, a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimson globe in a blue-black sky, shone blisteringly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sky was soberly dark, cold and hostile. In alarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">haste, he struggled toward the grim line of high, red</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he saw a round white object in the red sand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pausing to gasp for breath and to rub the sweat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">red mud from his forehead, he kicked at it curiously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A sun-bleached human skull rolled out of the scarlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust. He knew at once that it was human, not a skull</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a creature like the gray things behind him on the sand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the unpleasant feeling that he was opening the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forbidden book of some forgotten tragedy, he fell to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees in the dust, and scooped about with his fingers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His right had closed upon a man's thigh bone. His left</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught in a rotten leather belt, that pulled a human verte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bra out of the dust. The belt had a tarnished silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckle, and he looked at it with a gasp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It bore an elaborate initial "E."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "E!" he muttered.

It is available in printed</seg><seg type="columnLine">form today, and gives a detailed account of the tragic</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture. The hopeful starting from earth. The dangers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and discouragements of the voyage. A mutiny; half the</seg><seg type="columnLine">,crew killed. The thrill of landing on a new planet. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack of the blue globes. How they took the ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried their prisoners to the pens, where they tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">use them to breed a new variety of domestic animals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Envers' escape, his desperate attempt to find the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they had landed in the desert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Bill did not read it all then.

But it is too late."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Thick red dust swirled up in Bill's face. He tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to breathe, choked and sneezed and strangled. Looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">up from the yellowed pages of the dead explorer's note-</seg><seg type="columnLine">book, he saw great clouds of red dust hiding the darkly</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue sky in the east. It seemed almost that a colossal</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-yellowed cylinder was being rolled swiftly upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from eastward:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A dust-storm was upon him!

The wind howled behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, overtook him and came screaming about his ears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red dust fogged chokingly about his head. The line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cliffs before him vanished in a murky red haze. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind blew swiftly, yet it was thin, exerting little force.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The dusty air became an acrid fluid, choking, unbreath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blindly, he staggered on, toward the rocks. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached them, fought his way up the bank of talus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambling over gigantic blocks of lava. The base of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliff was before him, a massive, perpendicular wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising out of sight in red haze. He skirted it, saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbable chimney, scrambled up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At last he drew himself over the top, and lay flat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scarlet dust-clouds swirled about him: he could not see</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty yards. He made no attempt to find the Red</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rover; he knew he could not locate it in the dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HOURS passed as he lay there, blinded, suffocating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling the hot misery of acrid dust and perspi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ration caked in a drying mud upon his skin. Thin winds</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed about the rocks, hot as a furnace-blast. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">leveled his torpedo, tried to watch. But he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a murky wall of red, with the sun biting through</seg><seg type="columnLine">it like a tiny, round blood-ruby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The red sun had been near the zenith. Slowly it</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept down, toward an unseen horizon. It alone gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him an idea of direction, and of the passage of time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then it, too, vanished in the dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Suddenly the wind was still. The dust settled slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In half an hour the red sun came into view again, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the red western horizon.

In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes he saw a blue globe. Then another, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a third. They were far toward the southeast, drifting</seg><seg type="columnLine">high and fast through the saffron haze.

The others were</seg><seg type="columnLine">all like himself, caked with dried red mud, gasping asth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matically from exertion and excitement. Men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling to get pieces of heavy machinery aboard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier--vitalium power generators that had been used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat the furnaces, and even a motor ray tube that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been borrowed from the ship's power plant for emer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gency use in the improvised smelter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Prince and Dr. Trainor were laboring furiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">over an odd piece of apparatus. On the red sand beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silver sunship, they had set up a tripod on which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted a curious glistening device. There were lenses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisms, condensers, mirrors. The core of it seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a strange vacuum tube--which had an electrode of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerium, surrounded with a queer vitalium grid. A tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">filament was glowing in it; and the induction coil which</seg><seg type="columnLine">powered the tube, fed by vitalium batteries, was buzzing</seg><seg type="columnLine">incessantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Better get aboard, and off!" Bill cried. "No use to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose our lives, our chance to save the world--just for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little mining machinery."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Prince looked up in a moment, leaving the queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">little device to Dr. Trainor. "Look at the Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships!" he cried, sweeping out an arm. "Must be thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sight, swarming up like flies. We couldn't get away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And against those purple atomic bombs, the torpedoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have a chance.

He shrugged hopelessly, then looked anxiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">off to the north again, scanning the red plateau.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Paula! What's become of her?" he demanded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Paula? Is she gone?" The Prince turned from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tripod, looked around suddenly. "Paula! What could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have happened to her ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A broken heart has happened to her," Bill told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You think--you think-" stammered the Prince.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">There was sudden alarm in his dark eyes, and a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">tender longing. His bitterly cynical smile was gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bill, she can't be gone!" he cried, almost in agony.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You know she was on lookout duty at the north end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the plateau.

But I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong. If she's gone, Bill--it will kill me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Prince spun about with abrupt decision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get everything aboard, and fit the ship to take off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as possible," he ordered. "Dr. Trainor is in</seg><seg type="columnLine">command. Give him any help he needs. Brand, test</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything when the tube is replaced; keep the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to fly." He turned swiftly to Trainor, who still</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked deftly over the glittering little machine on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tripod. "Doc, you can operate that by yourself, as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if I were here. Do your best--for mankind! I'm go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to find your daughter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Trainor nodded in silent assent, his fingers busy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Prince, sticking a ray pistol in his belt, set off</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a desperate run toward the north end of the plateau.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a moment's hesitation, Bill staggered along be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him, still carrying the rocket torpedo strapped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was only half a mile to the end of the plateau. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes the Prince was there. Bill staggered up</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as he was reading a few scrawled words on a scrap</seg><seg type="columnLine">of paper that he had found fastened to a boulder where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paula had been stationed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the Prince of Space" it ran.

In desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">haste they plodded gasping along, following the scant</seg><seg type="columnLine">traces of Paula's footprints that the storm had left. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazy red cloud of dust rose about them, stinging their</seg><seg type="columnLine">nostrils. 1'hey strangled and gasped for breath in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin, dusty air. Sweaty grime covered them with a red</seg><seg type="columnLine">crust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a mile they followed the trail.

They skirted the edge of the ledge, but no prints</seg><seg type="columnLine">were visible in the sand. The small red eye of the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just above the ocherous western rim of the planet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their perspiring bodies shivered under the first chill of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frozen Martian night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's no use," Bill muttered, sitting down on a block</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time-worn granite, and wiping the red mud from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. "She's probably been gone for hours. No chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got to find her!" the Prince cried, his lean, red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stained face tense with determination. "I'll circle about</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little, and see if I can't pick up the trail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill sat on the rock. He looked back at the low dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">rim of cliffs, a mile behind, grim and forbidding against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the somber, indigo sky. The crimson, melancholy</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendor of the Martian sunset was fading in the west.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The silver sunship was out of sight behind the cliffs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he could see the little blue globes, like spinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">moons of sapphire, circling watchfully above it. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were lower now, some of them not a thousand feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the hidden sunship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly, one of them was enveloped in a vivid flare</seg><seg type="columnLine">of orange light. Its blue gleam flickering out, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell in fragments of twisted white metal. Bill knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it had been struck with a rocket torpedo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reply was quick and terrible. Slender, dazzling</seg><seg type="columnLine">shafts of incandescent whiteness stabbed down toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship, each of them driving before it a tiny bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">spark of purple fire, coruscating, iridescent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were the atomic bombs, Bill knew. A dozen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them must have been fired, from as many ships. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few seconds he heard the reports of their explosions--</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the thin, still air, they were mere sharp cracks, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol reports. They exploded below the line of his vi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. No more torpedoes were fired from the unseen sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. Bill could see nothing of it; but he was sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been destroyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard the Prince's shout, thin and high in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rare atmosphere. It came from a hundred yards beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've found the trail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill got up, trudged across to follow him. The Prince</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited, impatiently, but gasping for breath. Just half</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the red disk of the sun was visible in the indigo sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the straight horizon, and a chill breeze blew upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess that ends the chance for the world!" Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose so.

The vitomaton might have saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, if Trainor had had a chance to use it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They plodded on through the dust, straining their eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow the half-obliterated trail in the fading light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It grew colder very swiftly, for Mars has no such thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket atmosphere to hold the heat of day as has the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twilight was short. Splendid wings of somber crim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son flame hung for a moment in the west. A brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden glow shone where it had been. Then the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dark, and the million stars were standing out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold, motionless majesty--scintillantly bright, unfeeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchers of the drama in the desert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill felt tingling cold envelope his limbs. The sweat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mud upon him seemed freezing. He saw the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">glitter of frost appear suddenly upon his garments, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the red dust. The thin air he breathed seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">freeze his lungs. He trembled. His skin became a stiff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">numb, painful garment, hindering his movements. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prince staggered on ahead of him, a vague dark shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the night, crying out at intervals in a queer, strained</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BILL stopped, looked back, shivering and miserable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No use to go on," he muttered. "No use." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood still, vainly flapping his numb arms against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides. A vivid picture came to him--a naked, staring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PRINCE OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">893</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sun-bleached skull, lying in the red dust. "Bones in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust," he muttered. "Bones in the dust. Envers' bones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Paula's, The Prince's. Mine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw something that made him stare, oblivious of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The red cliff had become a low dark line, below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">star-studded sky. The score of little cobalt moons were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still drifting around and around, in endless circles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching, waiting. They were bright among the stars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little green cloud came up into view, above the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">rim of the cliff. A little spinning wisp of greenish vapor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A tiny sphere of swirling radiance. It shone with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear lucent green of spring, of all verdure, of life itself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It spun, and it shone with live green light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With inconceivable speed, it darted upward. It struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the blue globes. A sparkling mist of dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerald atoms flowed over the azure sphere, dissolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, melted it away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill rubbed his eyes. Where the sapphire ship had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been was now only a swirling mass of green mist, a cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">of twinkling emerald particles, shining with a supernal</seg><seg type="columnLine">viridescent radiance that somehow suggested life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly as the first tiny wisp of green luminescence</seg><seg type="columnLine">had appeared, this whirling cloud exploded. It burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">into scores of tiny globes of sparkling, vibrant atoms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The green cloud had eaten and grown. Now it was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">producing itself like a living thing that feeds and grows</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sends off spores.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And each of the little blobs of viridity flew to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">azure sphere. It seemed to Bill as if the blue ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew them--or as if the green globules of swirling mist</seg><seg type="columnLine">were alive, seeking food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In an instant, each swirling spiral of emerald mist had</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck a blue globe. Vibrant green haze spread over</seg><seg type="columnLine">every sphere. And the spheres melted, faded, vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">in clouds of swirling viridescent vapor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It all happened very suddenly. It was hardly a second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill thought, after the first of the swirling green blobs</seg><seg type="columnLine">had appeared, before the last of the Martian fliers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become a mass of incandescent mist. Then, suddenly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had come, the green spirals vanished. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">blotted out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stars shone cold and brilliant, in many-colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendor, above the dark line of the cliffs. The Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships were gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The vitomaton!" Bill muttered. "The Prince said</seg><seg type="columnLine">something about the vitomaton. A new weapon, using</seg><seg type="columnLine">the force of life. And the green was like a living thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">consuming the spheres!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he felt the bitter cold again. He moved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his garments were stiff with frost. The cold had</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbed his limbs--most of the pain had gone. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curious lightness, an odd sense of relief, of freedom--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a delicious, alarming desire for sleep. But leaden</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain of cold still lurked underneath, dull, throbbing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Move! Move!" he muttered through cold-stiffened</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips. "Move! Keep warm!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stumbled across the dust in the direction the Prince</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken. The cold tugged at him. His breath froze in</seg><seg type="columnLine">swirls of ice. With all his will he fought the deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire for sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had not gone far when he came upon a dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape in the night. It was the Prince, carrying Paula</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I found her lying on the sand," he gasped to Bill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She was awake. She was glad--forgave me--happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">jiow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Prince was exhausted, struggling through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand, burdened with the girl in his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why go on?" Bill forced the words through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">freezing face. "Never make it. They shot atomic bombs</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Red Rover. Then something happened to them. Green</seg><seg type="columnLine">light."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The vitomaton!" gasped the Prince. "Vortex of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinning, disintegrated atoms. Controlled by wireless</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. Alive! Consumes all matter! Disintegrates it</seg><seg type="columnLine">into atomic nothingness!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He staggered on toward the dark line of cliffs, clasp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the inert form of the girl to his body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But Paula! I love her. I must carry her to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. It is my fault. We must get to the ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BILL struggled along beside him. "Too far!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered. "Miles, in the night. In the cold. We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">never-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped, with a thin, rasping cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before him, above the narrow black line of the cliffs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slender bar of luminescent silver had • shot up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">view. It was the slim, tapering cylinder of the Red</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rover, with her twelve rear motor rays driving white</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dazzling against the mountain she was leaving. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunship, unharmed, driving upward into space!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My Godl" Bill screamed. "Leaving us!" He stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered forward, a pitiful, trembling figure, encased in</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff, frost-covered garments. He waved his arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted. It was vain, almost ludicrous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Prince had stopped, still holding Paula in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They think--Martians got us!" he called in a queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. "Stop them! Fire torpedo--at boulder. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">will see!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill heard the gasping voice. He unfastened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy tube that he still carried on his shoulder, leveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">it before him. With numb, trembling fingers, he tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move the levers. His fingers seemed frozen; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not move. Tears burst from his eyes, freezing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his cheeks. He stood holding the heavy tube in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, sobbing like a baby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above them, the slender white cylinder of the Red</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rover was driving out into star-gemmed space, dazz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling opalescent rays shooting back at the dark mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'They go," Bill babbled. "They think we are dead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Have not time to wait. Go to fight for world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He collapsed in a trembling heap upon the loose, frosty</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Prince had suddenly laid Paula on the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lift the rocket," he gasped. "Aim. I will fire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill raised the heavy tube mechanically, sighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the telescope. His trembling was so violent that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could hardly hold it upon the rock. The Prince tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his fingers to move the lever, in vain. Then he bent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed his chin against it. It slipped, cut a red gash in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his skin. Again he tried, and the whir of the motor re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponded. He got his chin upon the little red button,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed it. The empty shell drove back, fell from Bill's</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbed hands and clattered on the sand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The torpedo struck with a burst of orange light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Prince picked up Paula again, clasped her chilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">body to him. Bill watched the Red Rover. Suddenly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">voiced a glad, incoherent cry. The white rays that drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">her upward were snapped out. The slim silver ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung about, came down on a long swift glide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">894</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment, it seemed, she swept over them, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchlight sweeping the red sand. The white beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the three. Quickly the ship dropped beside them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grotesque figures in vacuum suits leapt from the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few seconds they were abroad, in warmth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. Hot, moist air hissed into the lock about them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they could breathe easily again. The sizzling of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air through the valves was the last impression of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill was conscious, until he found himself waking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a comfortable bed, feeling warm and very hungry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Brand was standing with his blue eyes peering</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just looked in to see you as I was going on duty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill," he said. "Doctor Trainor says you're all right</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. The Prince and Paula are too. You were all rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">chilled, but nothing was seriously frozen. Lucky you</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot off the rocket. We had given up hope for you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't dare stay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Funny change has come over the Prince. He's been</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a good while, sitting by Paula's bed. How's that for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the misogynist--the hermit outlaw of space? Well, come</seg><seg type="columnLine">on up to the bridge when you've had some breakfast. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle with Mars is going to be fought out in the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">few hours. Ought to be something interesting to see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having delivered his broadside of information so fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the sleepy Bill could hardly absorb it, the bluff old</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-captain withdrew his head, and went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour later Bill entered the bridge-room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gazing through the vitrolite panels, he saw the fami-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liar aspect of interplanetary space--hard, brilliant points</seg><seg type="columnLine">of many-colored light scintillating in a silver-dusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">void of utter blackness. The flaming, red-winged sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">was small and far distant. Earth was a huge green</seg><seg type="columnLine">star, glowing with indescribably beautiful liquid emerald</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliance; the moon a silver speck beside it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The grim red disk of Mars filled a great space in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens. Bill looked for a little blue dot that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible upon the red planet for so long--the tiny azure</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle that he had first seen from the telescope in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trainor's Tower. He found the spot where it should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, on the upper limb of the planet. But it was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The thing has left Mars," Captain Brand told him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It has set out on its mission of doom to Earth!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is armored with one of their blue vibratory screens.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What hellish contrivances of war it has in it, and what</seg><seg type="columnLine">demoniac millions of Martians, no one knows. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous, more than a mile in diameter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can we do anything?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hardly see how we can do anything. But we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">try. Trainor and the Prince arc coming with their vito-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maton."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, didn't they shoot their atomic bombs at the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">last night?" Bill asked. "It was out of sight, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined they had wrecked it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One of the lookouts who was late getting back</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought down one of their globes with a rocket. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired a lot of the purple bombs to scare us. But I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">they meant to take us alive. In the interest of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">science, I suppose. And Dr. Trainor got the vitomaton</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready before they had done anything."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill was peering out into the star-strewn ebon gulf.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Brand pointed. He saw a tiny blue globe, swim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming among the stars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's the infernal thing! Carrying its cargo of</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror to our earth!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few moments Dr. Trainor, the Prince, and Paula</seg><seg type="columnLine">came one by one up the ladder to the bridge. Trainor</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried the tripod; the Prince brought a little black case</seg><seg type="columnLine">which contained the strange vacuum tube with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerium electrode, and its various accessories; Paula had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little calculating machine and a book of mathematical</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Trainor and the Prince set up the tripod in the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room, and mounted the little black case upon it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The apparatus looked not very different from a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">camera. Working with cool, brisk efficiency, Paula be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan operating the calculating machine, taking numbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the book, and calling out the results to the Prince,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was setting numerous small dials on the apparatus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Trainor peered through a compact little telescope</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was evidently an auxiliary part of the apparatus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">training the machine on the tiny blue disk that was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">messenger of doom from Mars. From time to time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">called out numbers which seemed to go into Paula's</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking curiously at Paula and the Prince, Bill could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see no sign of an understanding between them. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed absorbed in the problem before them. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were impersonal as any two collaborating scientists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last Dr. Trainor raised his eyes from the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescope, and the Prince paused, with his fingers on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny switch. The induction coil, in the circuit of a power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful vitalium generator, was buzzing monotonously, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple fire leapt between its terminals. Paula was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficiently busy over the little calculating machine, press-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing its keys while the motors whirred inside it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">E'RE all ready," Trainor announced, "as sooi^</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Paula finishes the integration." He turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill and Captain Brand, who were eying the apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">with intense interest. "If you will look inside this elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tron tube, when the Prince closes the switch, you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">see a tiny green spark come into being. Just at the focus</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rays from the cerium electrode, inside the vita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lium helix grid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That green spark is a living thing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It has in it the vital essence. It can consume matter---</seg><seg type="columnLine">feed itself. It can grow. It can divide, reproduce itself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It responds to stimuli--it obeys the signals we send from</seg><seg type="columnLine">this directional beam transmitter." He tapped an insig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificant little drum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And it ceases to be, when we cut off the power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a living thing, that eats. And it is more de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structive than anything else that eats, for it destroys</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atoms that it takes into itself. It resolves them into</seg><seg type="columnLine">pure vibratory energy, into free protons and electrons."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paula called out another number, in her soft, husky</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. The Prince swiftly set a last dial, pressed a tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">lever. Bill, peering through the thin walls of a little elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tron tube, saw a filament light, saw the thin cerium disk</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow incandescent, apparently under cathode bombard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Then he saw' a tiny green spark come into being,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a fine helix of gleaming vitalium wire. For a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it hung there, swinging back and forth a little,</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deliberately, one by one, the Prince depressed keys</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a black panel behind the tube. The little green spark</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavered. Suddenly it shot forward, out through the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tube. It swam uncertainly through the air in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, growing until it was large as a marble. The Prince</seg><seg type="columnLine">flicked down another key, and it darted out through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vitrolite panel, towards the blue globe from Mars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PRINCE OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">895</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had cut a little round hole in the transparent crystal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hole the size of a man's finger. The matter in it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished utterly. And the little viridescent cloud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">curdled light that hung outside had grown again. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as large as a man's fist--a tiny, whirling spiral of vib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rant emerald particles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Air hissed through the little hole, forming a frozen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">misty cloud outside. Captain Brand promptly produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little disk of soft rubber, placed it against the opening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Air-pressure held it tight, sealing the orifice. N</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Prince pressed another key, the little swirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">green sphere was whisked away--it vanislftd. The Prince</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood intent, fingers on the banks of keys, eyes on red</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointers that spun dizzily on tiny dials. Another key</seg><seg type="columnLine">clicked down suddenly. He moved a dial, and looked ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectantly out through the vitrolite panel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill saw the green film run suddenly over the tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue globe floating among the stars. The azure sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to melt away, to dissolve into sparkling green</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiance. In a moment, where the great blue ship had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been, was only a spinning spiral of glistening virides-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look at Mars!" cried the Prince. "This is a chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenge. If they want peace, they shall have it. If they</seg><seg type="columnLine">want war, they shall feel the power of the vitomaton!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill turned dazedly to look at the broad disk of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red planet. It was not relatively very far away. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the glistening white spot that was the north polar</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap, the vast ocherous deserts, the dark equatorial mark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, the green-black lines of the canals. For all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimness of its somber, crimson color, it was very bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant against the darkness of the spangled void.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An amazing change came swiftly over Mars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bluish tinge flowed over orange-red deserts. A thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue mist seemed to have come suddenly into the atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere of the planet. It darkened, became abruptly solid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A wall of blue hid the red world. Mars became a colos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sal globe. Her surface was as real, as smooth and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken, as that of the ship they had just destroyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mars had become a sphere of polished sapphire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A wall of vibration, I suppose," said the Prince.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What a science to condemn to destruction!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Huge globes of purple fire--violet spheres large as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship they had just destroyed--driven on mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays, leapt out from a score of points on the smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">azure armor that covered a world. With incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, they converged toward the Red Rover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Atomic bombs with a vengeance!" cried the Prince.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"One of those would throw the earth out of its orbit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sun." He turned briskly to Paula. "Quick now!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Integrations for the planet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She sprang to the calculating machine; slim fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew over the keys. Trainor swung his apparatus to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the smooth azure ball that Mars had become,</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered through his telescope, called out a series of num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers to Paula. Quickly she finished, gave her results</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Prince.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bent over the banks of keys again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill watched the enormous blue globe of Mars in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinated horror, followed the huge, luminescent red-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">purple atomic bombs, that were hurtling out toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, driven on broad white rays.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An amazing amount of power in those atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombs," Dr. Trainor commented, his mild eyes bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">with scientific enthusiasm. "I doubt that space itself is</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong enough to hold up under their explosion. If they</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit us, I imagine it will break down the continuum, blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">us out of the universe altogether, out of space and time!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill was looking at the whirling green spiral that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung where the Martian flier had been. He saw it move</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, dart across the star-dusted darkness of space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It plunged straight for the blue ball of Mars, struck it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A viridescent fog ran quickly over the enormous azure</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mars melted away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The planet dissolved in a huge, madly spinning cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">of brilliant green mist that shone with an odd light--</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a light of life! A world faded into a nebulous spiral</seg><seg type="columnLine">of green. Mars became a spinning cloud of dust as if of</seg><seg type="columnLine">malachite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A tiny lever flicked over, under the Prince's fingers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the green light went out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where Mars had been was nothing! The stars</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone through, hot and clear. A machine no larger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a camera had destroyed a world. Bill was dazed, stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Solemnly, almost sadly, the Prince moved a slender,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanned hand across his brow. "A terrible thing," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. "It is a terrible thing to destroy a world. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">world that had been eons in the making, and that might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have changed the history of the cosmos. . . . But they</seg><seg type="columnLine">voted for war. We had no choice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook his head suddenly, and smiled. "It's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. The great mission of my life--completed. Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want you to pack the vitomaton very carefully, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock it up in our best safe, and try to forget the combina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. A great invention. But I hope we never need to</seg><seg type="columnLine">use it again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the Prince of Space did a thing that was amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to most of his associates as the destruction of Mars had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been. He walked quickly to Paula Trainor, and put his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms around her. He slowly tilted up her elfin face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the golden eyes were laughing now, with a great,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tender light of gladness shining in them. He bent, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kissed her warm red lips, with a hungry eagerness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost boyish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A happy smile was dancing in his eyes when he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at the astounded Captain Brand and the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Allow me," he said, "to present the Princess of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Space!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some months later, when Bill was landed on Trainor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tower, on a visit from his new home in the City</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Space, he found that the destruction of Mars had</seg><seg type="columnLine">created an enormous sensation. Astronomers were man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully inventing fantastic hypotheses to explain why the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red planet had first turned blue, then green, and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished utterly. The sunships of the Moon Patrol were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still hunting merrily for the Prince of Space. Since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss of the Triton's treasure, the reward for his capture</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been increased to twenty-five million eagles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The End</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tanks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Und er the Sea</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By Harl Vincent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Author of "Barton's Island," "Callisto at War," etc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     T^ERHAPS it is because radium is such a rare metal that so many of its bene-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     jL ficial aspects are developed.

This one had been brutal--</seg><seg type="columnLine">treacherous flying weather most of the way--and both</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupants of the plane's cabin were tense and irritable</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the strain.

"A young oil tank, painted with alu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minum, so help me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He banked sharply and swung the ship over for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer view. They circled the object and dropped to two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet. It was some sort of a cylindrical vessel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing vertically to a height of perhaps thirty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the placid waters and apparently fixed firmly as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it rose from the bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now what do you know about that?" Ben mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veled. "Who do you suppose built such a thing way</seg><seg type="columnLine">out here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if in answer to his question, a circular lid opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the flat top of the cylinder and a man's head was</seg><seg type="columnLine">poked through. The roar of their motor attracted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention and he looked skyward, as amazed as they.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then it happened; a gleaming weapon in the hands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stranger, a stabbing pencil of purplish light and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big radial motor in the nose of their ship quit cold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Challenger dropped to the surface in an easy glide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hell's bells!"

The plane was drifting</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer, carried in toward the metal cylinder by freakish</seg><seg type="columnLine">currents that seemed to eddy in to its polished sides from</seg><seg type="columnLine">all directions.

"What's the big idea ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he called out over the narrowing strip of water, "What'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">you bring us down for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He who seemed to be the leader of the ape-men yelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in unintelligible gutturals and then turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">converse with his companions. Replicas of the mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious ray weapon which had been used to bring them</seg><seg type="columnLine">down appeared in the hands of each of the dwarfs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're too many for us," Ben whispered. "What'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">we do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait and see what they do. We'll shoot it out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them if we have to, but what's the use of getting our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves croaked if we can talk ourselves out of it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who's going to talk that jabber of theirs?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe there is somebody down below in that thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can talk to.

I'd like to be home--right now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More of the ape-men had come up through the hatch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there were at least a dozen of them now on the flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of the cylinder. The plane was almost alongside</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a dense cloud of blue vapor spurted forth to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. They were completely enveloped in the vile smell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing stuff; blinded and coughing. Clammy hands pawed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at them in the darkness. Fingers of steel gripped them;</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong arms, cold and unyielding as metal bands, pin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioned them hand and foot, though they fought des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perately to save themselves. Neither dared fire his pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fear of hitting the other. They were helpless in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of a mysterious enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ETE CALDWELL mused gloomily in the steel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walled cell into which he had been thrown. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of an engineer and had served in the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea forces of the United States in the war of 1938, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throbbing of the pumps and the rush of water into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ballast tanks told him this was some sort of a sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marine into which they had been hauled. A monster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too! Funny, after the war he had sworn he never</seg><seg type="columnLine">again would enter one of the damned things--went in</seg><seg type="columnLine">for aviation instead and finally wound up as a pilot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chile-New Zealand mail service. Swell mess they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in now--Ben and he! Who these long-armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarfs were and what they were up to he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">even guess. Frisked him of his gun, too, the apes!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sub had grounded now and a key rattled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock of his cell door. A number of the dwarfs appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">and t.iey indicated that he was to follow them. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing to do but to comply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They followed a long passageway and were joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">by others who had Ben in tow. But the ugly, menacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures kept the two men apart, as if in fear of a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certed effort against them. Numbers of the ray weapons</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in evidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a door opened and they were prodded into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">confines of an airlock with the familiar circular hatches</seg><seg type="columnLine">at each end. The devils intended to drown them like</seg><seg type="columnLine">rats in a trap! But no--their captors remained with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. One of them was working with the clamps of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer cover. Could these weird creatures live under</seg><seg type="columnLine">water ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stepped out on solid ground and into a warm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fetid atmosphere. The sub had slipped through a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">airlock into a vast artificially lighted submarine cavern!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Christopher!" Ben yelled, "Look at 'em, Pete. Hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of the pig boats--or tractors, or whatever they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was true. The great arched cavern was literally</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded with the sub-surface ships. Pete rubbed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes in disbelief of what they told him. These subs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanks! Submarine tanks of shining metal that resem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled silver. Stainless steel or chromium plated, prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably, to better resist corrosion. Each cigar-shaped body</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mounted on huge caterpillar tracks that would en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able them to travel on land as well as on the ocean bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom. And there were rudders and fins, the same as</seg><seg type="columnLine">any submarine--twin screws astern. The cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which they had entered the one that had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">them was a huge conning tower. On all of them there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were torpedo tubes fore and aft; big gun turrets on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">superstructure. What terrible engines of destruction!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord!" Pete gasped. "Something goes on here--</seg><seg type="columnLine">something rotten in the state of Denmark, all right. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">this isn't Denmark by a long way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were being hustled along an elevated runway</seg><seg type="columnLine">of iron grating now, their captors prodding them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ray weapons. The cage of a lift awaited them at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the runway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR an interminable time, it seemed, they dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the bowels of the earth. Then they were in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly lighted room where it was ominously quiet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a square jawed, stern visaged man sat before a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad, glass topped desk. He looked up when they en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered and his short cropped, grizzled gray hair brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">an exclamation of recognition from Pete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Andre Shevan!" he exclaimed. Chevan--discredited</seg><seg type="columnLine">commander-in-chief of the Red forces in the last war,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exiled by the Peace Commission. It was impossible!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, the great Chevan, in person. Surprised?" The</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed exile grinned evilly. He dismissed his mal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed minions with a nod.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Naturally," Pete snarled. "What devilment are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to now ? And why did your gang of imps kidnap</seg><seg type="columnLine">us this way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Explaining the devilment can wait, young man. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the kidnaping, it was quite necessary, I assure you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You saw one of our war vessels and, of a certainty, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not let you report it to the world. We're not yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to show our hand. Besides, I can well use two</seg><seg type="columnLine">such accomplished and healthy Americans."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean you'll hold us here--against our will?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pete was incredulous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of a certainty. Not only that; I shall use you when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time comes to set forth against the Americas. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you are war veterans and your experience will be of</seg><seg type="columnLine">value to me. Ah, war! It is the spice of life, is it</seg><seg type="columnLine">not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "War ?" Ben echoed Pete's exclamation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly. And such a war as you shall see and par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticipate in!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not on your life!" Pete snapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No? You have no alternative, my friend. And you</seg><seg type="columnLine">should not object--it is a great honor I am extending.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the pleasure it gives to me that you are Americans!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You shall fight your own people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're crazy as a coot!" Pete was contemptuous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Am I? Listen boys; I've been working with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Akata--imps you have called them, and apes--for more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ten years while the world at large has thought me</seg><seg type="columnLine">banished and safely out of the way on a barren and</seg><seg type="columnLine">TANKS UNDER THE SEA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">899</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted island. But--ha! ha!--a substitute languishes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my stead on that so remote island while I, Andre</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chevan, am here. The Akata number more than seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions. No, don't laugh. They are decended from an</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligent people who migrated to this vast realm under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pacific more than thirty centuries in the past. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand years before the time of your Christ they knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secret of the transmutation of metals, of the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marine, of the death ray and of atomic disintegration--</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the rest of the world was in abysmal ignorance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">science. For centuries they've planned a war against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outside world and were well on the way to complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparation, before I came to organize them and lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Now the time is at hand and I, Andre Chevan</seg><seg type="columnLine">am to have my vengeance upon the world that cast me</seg><seg type="columnLine">off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His heavy features became saturnine with the fanati-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cism that lighted them. Pete and Ben stared at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">agape. The man was insane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now we know you're a nut," Pete grated. "Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">forts and battle planes'll blow these tanks of yours to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kingdom-come, before you've well started."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes? Let me tell you something. Every sub-tank of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the more than six hundred is armed with paralyzing</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays that will cause your big guns to miss fire and your</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes to fall from the air.

The tanks will crawl up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the depths of the ocean and overrun the Americas</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the speed of fifty miles an hour, blasting your cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ashes with death rays and high explosives, your for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ests with flame projectors. After America, the world!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Akata will ravage and plunder and kill. They'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">take possession. And I shall be king!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho! A modern Napoleon!" Pete sneered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chevan glared an instant, then chuckled, "Well put,</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man. Your grasp of the idea is perfect. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, I have a proposition to make to you and your</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend. The Akata are of marvelous intelligence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">skill. They are fearless and loyal. But you have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">them--I hardly fancy them as intimates. Rather would</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have two such as yourselves for my trusted lieutenants.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Join me in this campaign and the world is yours. You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">share with me in the glory and honor and wealth that</seg><seg type="columnLine">are to be mine--the power--think of it! It is a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a million!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose we refuse?" Ben inquired softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Pete poked his ribs surreptitiously to silence him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chevan was drawing a finger across his own throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaningly, a malicious leer making an awful mask of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his countenance. "One of my Akata guards is expert</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the knife," he said, "and eager to use it at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">command."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give us a week to think it over," Pete said suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bestowing an imperceptible wink on his wrath-filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chevan regarded first one and then the other of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">captives with keen suspicion, but could discern naught</seg><seg type="columnLine">save awed solemnity in their faces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll do it," he agreed. "Seven days of twenty-four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours. I believe by that time you'll willingly come in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">iThe folly of doing otherwise will be only too apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you--after you have seen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Meanwhile?" asked Pete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are free to come and go; to check up on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">statements. You'll be quartered and fed--and watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rang for his servants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHEVAN was as good as his word. The two Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">icans were assigned to luxurious rooms and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">served with meals at the commander's own table. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were taken in charge by one of the Akata, a putty-faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature with feline eyes, who answered to the name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ongli and was inordinately proud of his ability to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse with them in choppy sentences of broken English.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a surly way he was solicitous of their every want,</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompanying them wherever they wished to go and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaining in detail the many wonders of Aka which</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused their curiosity. They went everywhere and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw everything, but always they were trailed by a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of the sullen Akata guards--uncanny creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose staring eyes followed their every move and whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">ominous mutterings provided a monotonous accompani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment to their every conversation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ongli, it seemed, was a leader of his kind and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vastly superior class and influence. His word was law</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the guards and amongst the rabble on the moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways, in the pneumatic tubes, or in workshop or foun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry. His badge of authority gained them admission</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherever they wished to go. The science of the Akata</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at his finger-tips, and he proudly exhibited his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of its most complex secrets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Ongli was destined to be a great chief when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new order of things was established in the surface world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chevan had told him so himself. And was not Chevan</seg><seg type="columnLine">a god--mightiest of all earthlings, beneath the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">or above?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ben was inclined to be argumentative and openly de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiant. What sense was there is shamming this way?</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'd never join up with this crazy scheme, so why</seg><seg type="columnLine">not kick over the traces at once and have it over with?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chevan would have their life blood in the end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut up, you dumb-bell!" Pete hissed, when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on their way to one of the chemical laboratories of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Ongli had told them. "Trust me now to dope</seg><seg type="columnLine">something out. And you keep your trap shut! We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no conversations at all until the time's up. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">guy Chevan's clever. He'll get wise in a minute unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">we pretend-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that you say?" Ongli asked suspiciously. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guards moved in closer at the sound of his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He doesn't want to go," said Pete, feigning impa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tience with his partner, "Wants to go in one of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">sub-tanks instead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That can wait two, three sleeps," Ongli averred, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion allayed. "This more important. It basic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guards fell back and Pete glared at his friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">warningly. They'd have to be mighty careful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had stepped forth on a ledge that skirted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of an enormous cavern, a great arched hollow be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the bed of the Pacific, a cavern such as the eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">of man had never beheld. Brilliantly illuminated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cold blue light the Akata produced so abundantly, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched off into the distance where the haze of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">humid atmosphere rendered all things invisible. A city</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay beneath their feet, a city of tall buildings and broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets that hummed with activity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ongli waved his arm with an all-inclusive gesture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oniri," he exclaimed, "First city of Aka. First of</seg><seg type="columnLine">main cavern. First of seven hundred cities. Queen city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Aka."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?" Pete gasped. "You mean to tell me there</seg><seg type="columnLine">are seven hundred cities like this down here? How</seg><seg type="columnLine">big is Aka, anyway?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">900</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I speak true." Ongli drew himself to his full height</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressively. "Nine caverns there are. Seven hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities. Main cavern a thousand--what you call it--miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">long. Yes. It true. And other caverns below. Others</seg><seg type="columnLine">to north. One south. Aka a big place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll say it is!" Pete Caldwell was aghast at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">revelation. Somehow he had thought that Chevan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">exaggerating when he spoke of the numbers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Akata. This was a continent in itself, a continent under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ben was grouchily silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ongli led them to a niche in the rock wall. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a platform that stretched along the side of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth metal groove, the lower half of a cylinder which</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended at circular covers set into the walls at either ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Station of air pressure tube," Ongli explained. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">go twenty miles to laboratory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came a rapidly rising hiss, a screech almost,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one of the circular doors popped open to disgorge a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet-shaped car that came to a stop in the groove beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. In a moment they were within and the door had</seg><seg type="columnLine">clanged shut. There was a roar and the pressure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">swi ft acceleration as the car was shot into that smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">walled tube that led into the unknown distances of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange submarine realm. Pete looked around the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior curiously. There were no passengers excepting</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own party. Ben was staring at the wall, stub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bornly refusing to exhibit his amazement. Ongli and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Akata guards had sprawled carelessly on the cush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioned seats and were regarding their charges with ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressionless fishy eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In less than five minutes the car slowed down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to a lurching stop. The door clicked open and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they stepped out into a duplicate of the station at which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had embarked. Ongli led the way through a nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row passage to the laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above them there rose a huge crystal dome which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that separated them from the tremendous weight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water above. The light of the sun shone through with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an eerie blue-green radiance which illuminated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern with a sort of sepulchral twilight. In the half</seg><seg type="columnLine">light they could make out dim monstrous shapes, huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders and spheres that throbbed with energy from</seg><seg type="columnLine">within. Here and there a light glowed over a control</seg><seg type="columnLine">board and, in the circle of each, they could make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stunted figures of Akata workmen engaged in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious tasks occasioned by the operation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant machines. At the far end of the long main aisle</seg><seg type="columnLine">there arose a shower of brilliant sparks as a stream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">molten metal burst forth from a ladle and found its way</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a waiting mold. Huge cranes--dim, ghostly mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sters high overhead--rumbled ponderously over their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks and were lost in the gloom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here it was, and in hundreds of similar laboratories,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the essentials of life were produced by the Akata.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ingenuity and resourcefulness of the repulsive in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitants, as revealed by Ongli, were marvelous to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">template--and fearsome. Self-contained and self-sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porting was the realm of Aka and it seemed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligent gnomes that peopled it needed nothing more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the brine of the ocean to make any and all of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessities. From this they extracted the component ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, the separated hydrogen being used as the base</seg><seg type="columnLine">of practically every commodity. They merely broke up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the simple atoms of this element into protons and elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trons and then reassembled these to produce any of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">other elements they required. The need for the crystal</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome was accounted for by the fact that a certain catalyst</seg><seg type="columnLine">used in the processes was subject to rapid deteriora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion either in complete darkness or in the normal arti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficial lighting of the caverns but was not affected by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weak filtered sunlight from above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ongli halted them before a railed-in enclosure where</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of workmen were engaged in attaching a lift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rig to the huge eyes of a circular cover plate which</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested on the rim of a sunken cauldron of enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">size. Above them dangled the chain block of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cranes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Radium pit," their guide explained," must not come</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer as it very dangerous to life."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete noticed that the workmen were protected by</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaden aprons and gauntlets and that they wore helmets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the same material. The guards drew well back when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hooks were attached and the signal given for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crane operator to hoist the cover. Ben feigned an air</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nonchalant boredom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great cast lead lid swung free and a blast of</seg><seg type="columnLine">greenish incandescence smote them like the breath of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnace. The air about them vibrated to the energy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vicious boiling contents of the cauldron. Swirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers of the greenish substance stretched forth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">squirmed menacingly, then dropped writhing into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of seething material.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gaze not too long," Ongli warned. "There is blind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness in so doing. All of the power we use is thus born.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The radium it is so very-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Pete had glanced upward as a startled cry rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in the eerie purple twilight above. One of the chains</seg><seg type="columnLine">supporting the great metal lid had snapped and the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">casting teetered precariously on the two remaining sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports. It was directly over their heads, swaying jerkily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was another snap and it swung down with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swish. Pete grasped Ongli and threw him to the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">with jarring violence just as the swinging mass of metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed through the iron railing and carried two of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">workmen into the mouth of the radium pit. He lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting beside the prone figure of Ongli, noting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction that Ben had jumped sideways and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved himself by his action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frightful animal cries from the doomed workmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose piercingly above the din of the laboratory and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared beneath the bubbling surface of the greenish</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid. A momentary wild thrashing of arms brought a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horribly distorted Akata face to the surface. Where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring eyes had been there were awful smouldering</seg><seg type="columnLine">sockets; the flat features were a metallic mask, grinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">sardonically through the green phosphorescence. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was gone and dancing waves of the glowing liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapped triumphantly at the edges of the pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pandemonium broke loose in the great laboratory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the workmen deserting their posts and crowding to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene of the accident. A-siren shrieked with raucous in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistence. A din of babbling voices drowned out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds of the machines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ai! Ai!" wailed Ongli as Pete lifted him to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dragged him from the howling mob, "The radium</seg><seg type="columnLine">death! But Ongli lives by quick act of American. Ongli</seg><seg type="columnLine">never forget. Ongli repay."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fawned on his rescuer, trembling with emotion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he drew himself erect and glared at the guards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had gathered close.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ben grinned delightedly. This was a break. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkey-man would be a friend in need.</seg><seg type="columnLine">TANKS UNDER THE SEA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">901</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHEVAN sent for them before the sleeping period.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ongli had reported the accident and was engaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in animated conversation with his chief when they ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached the glass-topped desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Caldwell," said Chevan, "your quick action in sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Ongli from the radium death convinces me anew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are the very man I want for the great work to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. But I am compelled to warn you that his grati-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude can avail you nothing in any attempt to evade</seg><seg type="columnLine">the agreement with me. You can not escape from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aka. Four hundred and sixty feet of water roll over</seg><seg type="columnLine">your heads and there is but one exit from Aka--through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the airlock in the cavern of the sub-tanks. Ongli is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new-made friend, but his first loyalty is to the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause. Then, too, there are other watchers. Understand?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pete understood perfectly. Four hundred and sixty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet of water! That meant a pressure of some two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred pounds to the square inch on the doors of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">airlock and on the crystal domes of the laboratories.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What tremendous strength must be built into these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things and into the sub-tanks themselves!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We understand, Chevan," he said shortly. "But, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">accordance with your promise, we still have six days</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which to decide."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True. It is merely a warning I'm giving you. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall have your six days if you wish, but Pm confident</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll decide before the time is up--and decide right."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pete and Ben were mute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You do not answer." Chevan regarded them thought-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. He had had much experience with the stubborn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of Americans. "Very well, I'll not press you. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">each twenty-four hours will bring new revelations to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Each will further convince you of the wisdom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a decision to join us. I don't know why I'm giving you</seg><seg type="columnLine">this chance, but somehow it seems I need human com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panionship and assistance. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hesitated and looked apologetically at Ongli. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">great Chevan was not altogether happy in his adopted</seg><seg type="columnLine">environment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps," Pete ventured, "you are on the wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">track, Chevan. Maybe you'll give up this mad venture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'd gladly help you in that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?" the commander thundered, "go back to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">world that turned its back to me? Back to exile?</seg><seg type="columnLine">never! It's a rotten world anyway, and merits annihila-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. I shall establish a new order of things; a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization. From the destruction shall rise better</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. With the aid of Akata science I shall breed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a race of supermen and superwomen, moulded in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of the Nordic but of god-like beauty and stature</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with superhuman intelligence. And I, Chevan, shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">rule them--wisely and well. You think my venture</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a mad one. You think the conquest impossible. Here--</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at this!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strode to a wall cabinet and switched on the cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent of a television receiver. As the screen glowed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, Ongli excused himself and left the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another step in your education," he announced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">manipulating the dials of the instrument rapidly. "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">teleview surpasses anything in use on the surface. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitter is necessary to actuate it; a searching ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">is sent out to the point to be viewed and the light im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulses are brought back to us for observation in natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">color. The same ray conveys to us the sounds emanating</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the point of origin of the view. A great contri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance for your Secret Service--if they had it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The view of the screen was that of an enormous room</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">where hundreds of vertical cylinders lined the walls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which cylinders a maze of piping led through</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous other vessels and finally converged at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth of a great circular pit in the center of the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A pulsating blue-green glow permeated the atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room and all the workmen in sight were encased</seg><seg type="columnLine">in protective armor. The buzz of activity came to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears like that of a swarm of bees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Radium!" breathed Chevan, "ah, how little you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its uses and properties--you of the surface world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your scientists tell you that it is an element whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic weight is 226 and whose atomic number is 88.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They know of its continuous disintegration; of the emis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of alpha and beta particles; of the gamma radia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. Its products have been investigated by them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">are in partially successful use in therapy, the gas radon</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly. But in all their research and experiments</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have never learned the true secret of radioactivity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They have never been able to speed up the normal rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of disintegration of the radium atom as have the Akata.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The vast energy available from this source is thus lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the peoples of the surface world. Even did they</seg><seg type="columnLine">know these things it would avail them little, since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mineral is extremely rare up there as you know. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is an unlimited supply."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete was listening with interest as he watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen, but Ben affected his usual air of indifference and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked around the room, looking at everything excep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting the screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Radium exists in many forms?" Pete asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh yes--down through the uranium-radium-lead dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">integration series there are many stages. Radium itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">is produced by the disintegration of its parent, ionium,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disappears on disintegrating into its product radon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In turn then, down through the series, we have radium</seg><seg type="columnLine">A, B, C, and three other forms down to polonium--then</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead, the end product. Then, of course, there are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">compounds, sulphates, hydroxides, chlorides, bromides</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the like. It was a liquid compound you saw in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory. But the important thing is that the Akata</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand the stuff perfectly; their very existence de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pends on it, as does the success of the war against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper world. The vast energy of the alpha particles is</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to run their prime movers; tiny, vibrationless</seg><seg type="columnLine">radium motors provide all their power. Beta radiations</seg><seg type="columnLine">are used to set up disintegration of other elements and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in conjunction with the penetrating gamma radiations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to activate the various destructive rays to be used in</seg><seg type="columnLine">warfare. Here--another instructive view."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scene changed with a new adjustment of the dials.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A hollow roar came from the sound projector of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus. They were deep in a rock-walled passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, with a group of Akata workmen who were opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting the complicated mechanism with a huge ray projec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor. The roaring sound increased in volume as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinding shaft of light from the projector contacted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ledge of solid limestone fully thirty feet in depth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">extending for a hundred yards along the wall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage. Like a knife through cheese, the disintegrating</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy of the beam cut through the mass of rock, slicing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it neatly from the wall until, by its own tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight, it broke away the last remaining connection and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thundered to the floor with a crash that rattled the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism and caused the view to flutter violently on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wow!" Ben exclaimed, "some ray, that!" He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been startled from his pose by the wonder of the sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">902</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," Chevan gloated, "each sub-tank is armed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight such projectors, in addition to others equally de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structive in different ways. How long do you think</seg><seg type="columnLine">your paralyzed forts and battle planes will stand up</seg><seg type="columnLine">under such energies? Your skyscrapers? But watch!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The huge mass of stone was blocking the passage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of tons of it. The workmen directed the ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the mass, adjusting it to a broadened flare that</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered considerable portion of the enormous block.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The roar swelled to an ear-shattering rumble and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock melted away as if it had been paraffin, excepting</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no residue. It simply vanished from sight and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in less time than is taken in the telling, all was clear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see?" Chevan said triumphantly, "the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is in our hands is beyond comprehension. And this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is but the beginning of what you will be shown." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched off the power and the screen of the teleview</seg><seg type="columnLine">went blank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete gazed at their captor with growing realization</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the enormity of the menace to his world. "Chevan,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he muttered, "I'm beginning to believe some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things of which you have boasted. But I still think</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're barking up the wrong tree. Suppose you do</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeed in this terrible thing; suppose you overrun the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Americas and bring them under your heels. Suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">even, that you conquer the entire world. What about</seg><seg type="columnLine">these seven million Akata who will be let loose on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface? They'll defeat your plan to set up a new re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gime. They, not you, will be in control; they'll populate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface with their own breed and continue to kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">off our present civilization. They may even kill you--•</seg><seg type="columnLine">after they've used you to lead them to victory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chevan smiled craftily and lowered his voice. "All</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of, my boy," he cackled. "The entire brood will</seg><seg type="columnLine">die off within a week after the victory is complete. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">take care of that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What? You think you have a way of killing them</seg><seg type="columnLine">off?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know I have. Listen--and this may help you in</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching you decision--I have no intention of letting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Akata benefit from the conquest. They do not fit into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my new scheme of things at all; they're too loathsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">physically, though possessed of marvelous intellect and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific attainment. Not for Andre Chevan. And here</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the means of eliminating them: Radium again is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret, the radium they must have for their continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence and which I shall cut off from them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">food they eat contains minute quantities of the element</seg><seg type="columnLine">which to us would be fatal but which to them is vital.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They've lived in such close contact with the stuff that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiny doses are necessary as a prophylactic. They'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have cTed off centuries ago had they not inured their</seg><seg type="columnLine">systems to its ravages in this manner. And here's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">joker--they must carry a supply of the stuff with them</seg><seg type="columnLine">for internal use, a special compound that is extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">unstable and can be deteriorated instantly by subjec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to radio waves of a definite frequency high above</seg><seg type="columnLine">any in use for practical purposes. But I, Chevan, have</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretly developed a powerful transmitter of this short</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave and, when the time comes, I will release its energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadcast. Their preservative will vanish like magic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they will die before they can renew the supply;</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ugly bodies disintegrating like that limestone block</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the space of twenty-four hours. Now--is Chevan</seg><seg type="columnLine">&gt;vise ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gazed into their horror-stricken faces with mali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious glee. They were in the hands of a fiend incarnate!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONGLI awaited them when they left their quarters</seg><seg type="columnLine">early in the next waking period. The sullen guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovered expectantly in the passage outside their door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now we visit sub-tank," Ongli announced brightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good," said Pete, without enthusiasm. His thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gloomy now; it was a strain, this fear of speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's thoughts aloud. He and Ben had refrained from</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation since leaving Chevan before the sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">period--the searching ray of his telephone view and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound mechanism would find them out. The walls sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">did have ears in this place--eyes too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ben was in a vile humor and lagged behind as Pete</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed Ongli to the tube station.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ongli, too, was less talkative than he had been, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">his every action bespoke consideration of the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had saved his life--and respectful gratitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they were in the speedy car of the pneumatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube Pete turned suddenly to the guide. "Ongli," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. "About this war against the upper world. Can</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing stop it? Even if something should happen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chevan?" The commander would have a job listening-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in on this conversation; he'd be kept mighty busy follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a car speeding at five hundred miles an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ongli eyed him in surprise. "Nothing stop war!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">averred. "Nothing happen to Chevan. But, even if did</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen, war go on. Akata make religion of hatred</seg><seg type="columnLine">against your world. Religion of hatred, upper world;</seg><seg type="columnLine">religion of love, radium. No, good friend, war is neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary. Must not fail. That why you must join with Ongli.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Save Ongli from radium death; now Ongli save you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">good friend. But only can save if you agree to join</seg><seg type="columnLine">Akata. Cannot return you to upper world. Even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, that not help. Good friend die then--when Akata</seg><seg type="columnLine">come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The eyes of the ape-man had at first glittered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fanaticism of a bitter enemy--that religious hatred</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world. Now they were wide with anxiety lest</seg><seg type="columnLine">his new friend seal his own death warrant by refusing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chevan's offer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete smiled with an attempt to reassure him, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapsed into gloomy silence once more. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">help to be gotten from this source. Chevan or no</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chevan, the plans would be carried out. He wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">why they ever had taken the exile in with them--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">how they had accomplished this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They left the car at the cavern of the sub-tanks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed Ongli down the long runway to one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster amphibians that waited at the inner door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge airlock. The guards left them at the entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the vessel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chevan say you learn much," said Ongli as he bolted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cover of the entrance lock from the inside. "Ongli</seg><seg type="columnLine">show you--yes, very much. This war machine to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ongli's own command when time comes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He proudly led the way to the control room of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The few Akata they encountered in the passages</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed low in recognition of Ongli's authority, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">without bestowing glares of hatred on the two Americans</seg><seg type="columnLine">who accompanied him. It was evident they would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">given short shrift were the protection of Chevan and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">aides withdrawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How much Akata will one of these ships carry?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pete inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Three thousand." Ongli's eyes lighted with pleasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he sat at the controls of the huge vessel. "Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand fighting men of Aka. But so simple the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">TANKS UNDER THE SEA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">903</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one man can handle from here. You shall see. Ongli</seg><seg type="columnLine">maneuver ship with own hands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before them were the intricate controls of the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tank, a maze of glittering instruments and handwheels</seg><seg type="columnLine">that covered the forward wall of the control room. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular window of heavy glass looked out over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curving hull plates toward the pointed bow and through</seg><seg type="columnLine">this they could see that the inner cover of the giant air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock which opened to the Pacific was being opened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ongli caressed a gleaming lever. At his touch there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the smooth purr of the radium motors from some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where in the vitals of the huge amphibian. At his touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of another lever they moved forward on the cater-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillar tracks. They were in the airlock now and Ongli</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked as they waited for the inner door to close.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sub-tanks to go out thus when time comes," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nearly two million Akata go with them. Provisions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ammunition, everything for campaign go, too. Tunnels</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Aka to America nearly ready now. Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnels other five million Akata enter surface world</seg><seg type="columnLine">after sub-tanks clear way. Bore through with disinte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grating energy when time comes. Then all in sunlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">where belong; where surface men mistreat them cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turies ago. This war of revenge, good friend."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Revenge?" echoed Pete and Ben.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Akata ancestors great scientists three thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago. Savages of upper world think science witch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft. Persecute our forebears without mercy Finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">few survivors escape to Aka, which then island in great</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea. Find rich mineral deposits. Radium ore in vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount beneath surface of island. Akata become miners</seg><seg type="columnLine">and live mostly in underground passages. Then come</seg><seg type="columnLine">great earthquake and tidal wave. Aka sink far beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves and Akata entombed. But not discouraged. De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velop science very much and prosper greatly. Multiply</seg><seg type="columnLine">for many generations and prepare war against surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. Now ready for war; ready to retake world</seg><seg type="columnLine">where once mistreated."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What ?" Ben snarled. "You've nurtured a grudge for</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty centuries ? Against descendants of savages of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark ages? Why, our modern civilization is absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">innocent of any of those old wrongs. How do you get</seg><seg type="columnLine">that way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ongli drew himself up proudly and fire flashed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his beady eyes. "Akata never forget," he announced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and you speak not truth. Your people same as ever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not innocent. Bad, spiteful, warring races still on sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Many, many wars up there since Aka sink. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch in teleview. We see horrible destruction of last</seg><seg type="columnLine">war. We find Chevan. He great general; great organ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">izer. He know much about strength and weakness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all nations up there. He hate them, too, because they</seg><seg type="columnLine">misuse him as Akata ancestors misused. We send sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tank for him and rescue. He lead us to victory. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">make upper world clean and good once more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, you nut!" Ben retorted. "Chevan is a double</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">crosser if there ever was one. He plans to-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Pete had clapped his hand over his partner's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. "You fool!" he hissed, "shut up! The big</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy's probably listening to every word. Want to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">bumped off right now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't give a damn! We're done for anyway. Can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see how hopeless it is? They're all set--they can</seg><seg type="columnLine">do just what they say they will. We'll either be croaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">here or back home, so what difference does it make?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ongli watched and listened in amazement. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understand why the two should be quarreling. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ways of the white men of the surface were incompre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hensible. Then suddenly he turned to his instrument</seg><seg type="columnLine">board. The airlock was filled with water outside them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the outer door was opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ugh!" he grunted. "Forget talk. We go out now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The beams of two powerful searchlights illuminated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waters far ahead of them and the two young Ame-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ricans lost themselves in contemplation of the wonders</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ocean's depths. The sub-tank crawled rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the smooth bottom and Pete watched carefully the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements of Ongli's deft fingers as he maneuvered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vessel. A forest of calcareous algae loomed before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and they crashed through it as some prehistoric</seg><seg type="columnLine">mastodon might crash through a forest of saplings. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant deep sea creature with armored sides and staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes that waved at the ends of long tentacles slithered</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the forward deck and was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We go to surface," Ongli stated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The throbbing of pumps mingled with the purr of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main motors. With these exhaustless radium engines</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no need of using compressed air to blow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ballast tanks as in the big boats with which Pete was</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar. The sub rose leisurely from the bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We not open conning tower," Ongli observed, "Che-</seg><seg type="columnLine">van say not. But can see from here. Also show you</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The twin screws were churning the water now and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sub shot forward at ten fathoms depth. Fifty, sixty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy miles an hour, if the speed indicator was correct.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pete gasped his astonishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can do ninety on surface," Ongli chortled, noting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his surprise. "These ships fast on land or sea. Watch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They broke the surface and scudded along behind a</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring bow wave. It was good to see the sun shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more, and the blue of the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ben uttered a startled exclamation from his position</seg><seg type="columnLine">at one of the starboard ports, "Look, Pete! A British</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ongli whipped his head around sharply. It was true.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There, not two thousand yards astern, was the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray shape, black smoke pouring from her funnels and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her ensign fluttering in the breeze. A puff of smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">issued from one of her forward gun turrets as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched and the sub was rocked by the force of a ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rific explosion. A column of water rose high where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell struck the water off their bow. The cruiser was</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquisitive as to the identity of this strange craft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete watched Ongli narrowly, wondering whether he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would submerge. Surely he could not submit to a closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspection by this war vessel of the surface world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ongli's eyes flashed fire as a second shot came across</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bow and suddenly he was snarling into the micro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone that hung before him. Rapid replies came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ears in the gutturals of Aka. Then came that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbing pencil of purple light from the stern turret,</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashing full against the hull of the cruiser.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sub had swung around now and Ongli was snap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping orders into the microphone. They could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun crew on the cruiser, frantically working with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless mechanism of a rapid-fire gun. The proud war</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel was rolling helplessly, her turbine-electric drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyzed by the vicious ray of the Akata.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't intend-?" Pete hesitated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do intend!" Ongli babbled fiercely. "Surface ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack sub. They go now. First of great war!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shouted a quick command and the sub vibrated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the energy of a powerful ray generator. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">904</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">deafening roar as the shaft of blinding light sped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sub on its mission of destruction. The cruiser was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrouded in a brilliant mist for a moment. Then it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, vanished utterly from the surface of the ocean, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">seething cauldron of tortured waters marking the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it had rested. A marvelous war machine of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest navy on earth, a thousand brave men vibrant</seg><seg type="columnLine">with life an instant before--gone, gone in the twinkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete Caldwell was assailed with nausea as Ongli gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">exultantly on the scene of destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1ATER, when they reported to Chevan, the captives</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the surface world were gloomy and taciturn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The commander regarded them with triumphant glee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Ongli recited the tale of his encounter with and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction of the cruiser.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Saw something this time, didn't you?" he chuckled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"begin to believe we'll succeed, don't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, curse you!" Ben growled. "And it's murder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's what it is. That cruiser didn't attack; she only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fired across our bows. Why-?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Enough!" Chevan roared. "It is but the beginning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All war is murder. And I'll have no criticism from such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you. Another word and I'll retract my agreement."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pete was nudging his friend into silence. They still</seg><seg type="columnLine">had five days to go and he was trying to think. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be some way in which they could outwit this mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">exile--some way to forestall the plans of the loathsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">Akata.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It seems," he said, in a placating tone, "that you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">us in your power, Chevan. I am almost convinced of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">final success of the war that is planned. Ben isn't--</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite. But he'll come around, I'm sure, before the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">is up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ben glared at him in disgust and opened his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if to object, then shutting it with a click of his teeth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he saw that fleeting look of guile he had often seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his friend's face when he was about to hatch one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his plots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I'm sure of it." Chevan settled back in his seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a satisfied smile. "It is just a matter of educa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and a little patience with you two until you see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light. I'm willing to wait until your period of grace</seg><seg type="columnLine">has expired. It'll be worth it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ongli gave us some of the history of Aka today,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Pete, as if nothing else mattered, "and told us</seg><seg type="columnLine">much regarding the plans for conquering the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. It's quite a revelation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hm--yes." He turned to Ongli suddenly. "You can</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave us now," he said, "until after the next sleep. Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port to Miti-oro and tell him I have commended you</seg><seg type="columnLine">for your action in destroying the enemy ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ongli bowed low and withdrew. Pete thought he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">an expression of suspicion pass over his distorted fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures. But you couldn't be sure about any facial ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression of these creatures--excepting the hatred that</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed from their beady eyes. Ongli was the only one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those they had seen, who did not register undying enmity</seg><seg type="columnLine">when his eyes rested on them. Funny they tolerated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chevan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No sooner had Ongli retired from the room when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chevan lowered his voice confidentially and leered at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">two unwilling guests. "That one," he said, "is the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">humanlike of all his kind. He seems to have understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and emotions that his fellows have long since for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten. But, even so, I do not relish the thought of him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as an intimate. God, but they're repulsive! I can't wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the time to press the release of the energy that will</seg><seg type="columnLine">spell the doom of the entire breed. Miti-oro, their king,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusts me. Ongli trusts me. But little do they suspect that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have discovered the secret of the frequency that will</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy their supply of the radioactive prophylactic on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which their existence depends. Little do they think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I, Chevan, am to be their Nemesis as they are to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Nemesis of the upper world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed a finger to a metal-studded door in a cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner of the room. 'Behind that door," he gloated, "there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the portable transmitter of the frequency that does</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trick. When the great work is accomplished and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of the breed of Aka have migrated to the surface I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall actuate that transmitter. Then Chevan alone will</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold the fate of the earth in his hands; the new era will</seg><seg type="columnLine">have begun. And you, Peter Caldwell, shall share in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">spoils; you, too, Benjamin Walton, if-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the front door came the cold voice of Ongli,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitingly sarcastic. "There be no 'if' Andre Chevan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ongli has heard. Now, Miti-oro hear and Chevan live</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to see the day. Traitor!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chevan had risen from his chair, his face purpling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quick as a flash his hand shot over the desk top and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was gripped a slender weapon at sight of which Ongli</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned suddenly to flee. But too late. The spiteful crack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ray pistol coincided with his movement and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden flash of light burst forth between his broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders; a splash of flame it seemed to be, searing</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame that spread'and devoured in an instant. Ongli was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more. Just vanished in a puff of vapor like a punc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured gas balloon. The news of Chevan's perfidy would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not reach Miti-oro now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So," the commander chuckled, replacing his ray pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the drawer from which he had taken it, "Ongli was</seg><seg type="columnLine">eavesdropping for the last time. Chevan is not caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">napping easily."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete clenched his fists and stared hopelessly at Ben.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their only friend in the realm was gone--though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have done them little good. Chevan was manipu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lating the dials of the teleview now and the screen lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its usual cold blow. A sinister countenance faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from its surface; beady Akata eyes wandered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to the other and then focussed hard on those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chevan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miti-oro greets you, Chevan," came a metallic voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the writhing lips of the apparition. "What is it</seg><seg type="columnLine">you wish ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Greetings, oh King," the commander replied, in silky</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones. "It is to report the passing of Ongli, your</seg><seg type="columnLine">majesty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ongli is dead?" Swift anger crossed the stern visage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ruler of Aka. "By whose hand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mine, your majesty," Chevan returned swiftly, "he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was plotting to return these captives to the surface and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I destroyed him. The upper world would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned and the campaign made more difficult. Ongli's</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of insulating material--they would learn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the protection against our rays-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Enough, Chevan. You have done well. You will now</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill the captives ?" Miti-oro eyed them dispassionately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold-bloodedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not yet, oh King. They have much knowledge which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wish to obtain. Some of it is vital. They shall live</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet a while."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is well, Chevan. But guard them well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of a certainty."</seg><seg type="columnLine">TANKS UNDER THE SEA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">905</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The screen dimmed and Chevan turned to face his</seg><seg type="columnLine">captives, a broad grin on his face. "You see," he exulted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"how Chevan wraps them around his little fingers?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even their king. Oh, I tell you, boys, this is soft. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is like stealing candy from children."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stony-faced devil, isn't he?" said Pete irrelevantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. And stony hearted. But Chevan has a stonier</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. Go now and don't forget what you have seen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard. But five days remain to you and, in that time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember--Chevan keeps his word. Chevan is all-</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful. I shall await your decision."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Speechless, they left the presence of the double-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealing braggart. And the guards followed them more</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely as they proceeded to their own quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE twenty-four hour periods passed more slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and miserably after that. Days, they were ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">customed to counting them, these interminable periods</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they could only keep track of by their own watches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chevan did not again send for them and a new guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">had supplanted Ongli; an unfriendly beast who rarely</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke to them and who watched them with eagle eye.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each day the muttering of the guards and of the Akata</seg><seg type="columnLine">with whom they came in contact became more menacing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Chevan's orders evidently were being respected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were taken wherever they wished to go and, grudg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly it is true, given all information for which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. They picked up a few words of the outlandish</seg><seg type="columnLine">language and were able to make their simple wants</seg><seg type="columnLine">known. They even visited the oxygen generators and</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-conditioning cells, the most vital mechanisms in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">realm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete was becoming a puzzle to his friend and a nuis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance to the guards, with whom he was continuously in</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. He had developed a habit of straying away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">picking up interesting objects. On several occasions</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was detected in the act of concealing some trifling</seg><seg type="columnLine">article on his person and this always brought an argu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment with two or more of the guards. Once he lost his</seg><seg type="columnLine">temper and sent one of the creatures kicking with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty wallop on the chin. He was immediately pounced</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon by the others and quickly wrestled into submission.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they refrained from injuring him; Chevan had or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered that their lives be spared--for seven sleeps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most of the sixth day was passed in the assembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop where the great sub-tanks were put together. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">they learned much more about the construction and</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation of these monster fighting machines. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned too of their vast difference from the submarines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the nations of the surface. The radium engines were</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous mechanisms and caused no pollution of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air when submerged. They eliminated the need for</seg><seg type="columnLine">batteries with their danger of evolving poisonous fumes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for coughing Diesel engines when on the surface.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the fuel compartments were little more than tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaden cases that occupied hardly more room than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailor's luggage, yet provided a cruising radius of twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand miles on land or sea. And the armament of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these engines of destruction! Fourteen-inch guns that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled projectiles containing a high explosive ten times</seg><seg type="columnLine">more powerful than any in use on the surface; ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectors of all kinds, each deadlier than the other; gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">disseminators that could wither an acre of forest at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">puff--these were but a few of the terrible implements of</seg><seg type="columnLine">warfare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the sixth sleeping period, Ben sneaked through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the connecting door and into Pete's room. He placed his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lips close to his friend's ear that the guards outside might</seg><seg type="columnLine">not overhear his conversation and to forestall any effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Chevan's in case he was listening the sound mech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anism of his teleview.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say!" he whispered huskily. "What're we going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do? Make a show of joining up and then wait for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to get away?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not on your life! We gotta stall off this crazy guy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his clever beasts. If they ever get started they'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean up the world. No fooling! This war junk of</seg><seg type="columnLine">theirs is the berries. Nothing can stop 'em if they get</seg><seg type="columnLine">going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah--looks bad. But how're we going to stop 'em?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got a plan, Ben. Been picking up some stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. The junk I let 'em catch me with was just for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did you get?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Plenty. Couple of their ray pistols and some gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombs. A bunch of keys and some other stuff we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">need."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No kidding! But, Pete, how in the devil can we</seg><seg type="columnLine">put it over on Chevan and these millions of apes that're</seg><seg type="columnLine">working for him? How can we get out of here and back</seg><seg type="columnLine">home? We'll just get ourselves bumped off and do no</seg><seg type="columnLine">good at all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is that so? Listen--I said I had a plan and I have.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe we'll be killed, but that'll be no worse than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way we are. And I'll bet we can bust up this war of</seg><seg type="columnLine">theirs, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unconsciously they had raised their voices, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been most careful in this respect previously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now they were startled by a sudden commotion in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall. The voices of Chevan in loud angry tones!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, quick!" Pete muttered, thrusting a cold metal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic object into Ben's hand. "A ray pistol. Might need</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rushed to snap on the lights and the two draped</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves negligently over adjoining chairs as if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been engaged in an inconsequential discussion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door flew open and Chevan pushed in, at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten of the ugly Akata behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ha!" he bellowed. "So you're planning treason!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Didn't know my sound apparatus could pick up whispers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you?" He roared a command to his minions in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Akata tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete had his feet drawn up under him and Chevan</seg><seg type="columnLine">was directly before him, shaking a ham-like fist in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. He could not have heard the part about the ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistols or he'd have had their lives by this time. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Akata had drawn their own ray pistols, but Pete saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these were only of the paralyzing kind. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders had been not to kill and these were their only</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The vibratory death for both of you!" Chevan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting. "A lingering and excruciating agony that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">still too good for you. I shall watch with delight as</seg><seg type="columnLine">your bodies tremble and oscillate with increasing in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensity until each joint shall have left its socket until-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He never finished the tirade, for Pete's feet shot forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and caught him full in the middle. A terrible trick of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Canadian wilds! The commander went down with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a terrific crash and did not rise. Blood gushed from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep gash in his temple where he had struck a corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the metal-topped table in falling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two Americans were on their feet now, the rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their disintegrators flashing amongst the aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished Akata. At each contact one of the deformed</seg><seg type="columnLine">906</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">creatures shriveled in a blinding flash and a puff of vapor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and was gone. Closely massed as they were, seven or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eight of them were obliterated at the first volley. Pete felt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his arm go dead as a paralyzing ray struck home. Ben's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">death ray had caught his antagonist in time to spoil</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his aim, else he'd have been completely paralyzed. One</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the remaining two darted for the door to spread the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">alarm. They must not let him get away! Pete dived</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through the air and brought him down in good old</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">football fashion. Then he straddled the malformed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">body and throttled his victim cheerfully and efficiently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ben had accounted for the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "First blood!" Pete chortled as he arose and closed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the door. "Now let's look at the old man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He knelt by the prostrate form of Chevan and felt for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bis pulse. The commander was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Dead as a herring, Ben," he said. "There goes an-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other dream of an empire. They always think they're</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">invincible, these would-be world conquerors. Then some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little thing like this-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The shriek of a siren interrupted him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Lord!" groaned Ben, "the alarm is out. These apes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are uncanny the way they learn things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Shut up!" Pete hissed. "We'll beat 'em to it." He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turned out the lights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THEY slipped into the passage and made for a dark</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">side hall. A number of hurrying Akata came howl-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing behind them. Pete tossed a gas bomb in their midst</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and pulled Ben into the side hall after him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Quick!" he whispered. "The small elevator. We'll</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">go down." Feeling was returning to his left arm and it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pained horribly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The automatic elevator dropped them a dozen levels</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or so at the touch of a button. Pete knew where they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were going and Ben did not question him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They emerged in a dark tunnel that was cut into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">solid rock. A pocket flashlight--another of Pete's pick-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ups--showed them the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You're heading for the magazine--where they store</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the high explosive!" Ben gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You bet! We'll blow it to kingdom come and a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whole corner of Aka along with it." He was fingering a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">small conical object.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What's that, Pete?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A detonator. You know--off the end of a shell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Going to set it for ten minutes to give us a chance to get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ben heaved a sigh of relief. He had wondered about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that--it would be just like Pete to blow them up along</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the magazine if he thought the sacrifice would upset</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the plans of the Akata.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  One of the metal doors of the magazine was ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A key from the bunch produced by Pete opened it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">readily. He struck the detonator sharply against the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stone floor to set off the cap and start the fuse burning,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then hurled it into an open canister and closed the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They ran along the passage and turned into another</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that led downward. These tunnels were deserted and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unlighted during the sleeping period but soon would be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">alive with searchers. They must hurry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Hovv'd you learn about all these passages?" Ben</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">jerked out as they ran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Map. Hooked one the other day and been studying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ben marveled at the resourcefulness and secretiveness</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of his partner. He'd never give him another argument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now they were coming into a lighted chamber. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices of a group of Akata reached them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Quiet," said Pete. "We'll have to croak 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They peered into the opening, which was a way sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the pneumatic tube. Three of the dwarfs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for a car. As many flashes from their dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">integrators accounted for them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Funny," said Ben as they walked to the platform,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"doesn't even make you feel squirmy to kill 'em. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">like shooting woodchucks or something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The swish of air warned them of the approach of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">car. The exit door from the incoming tube popped open</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it slid alongside. The door opened and they stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, brandishing their ray pistols.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Only three passengers were in the seats, two of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">being withered old creatures incapable of offering re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistance. None of them was armed and they readily sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted to the Americans, who gagged them and tied their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and feet with cord ripped from the upholstery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These cars were automatic, so there was no operator to</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Pete referred to his map now. "Next stop," he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced cheerfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Then where'll we be ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Navy yard, or whatever they call it. Where the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanks are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You son-of-a-gun!" Ben exclaimed in admiration.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But there'll be a gang of apes there, won't there?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, only the watchmen. The searching parties'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">never dream we could get there so quickly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But Pete was overly optimistic in this, for when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little car of the pneumatic tube pulled into the next sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion they found it was alive with armed Akata.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Now we're in for it," groaned Ben.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Easy now," Pete warned. "We'll gas 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He unclamped the door and swung it a few inches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurling one of the egg-shaped grenades into the midst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crowd. There was a muffled explosion and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door closed once more. Rushing to the forward end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the car he closed the emergency switch that made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic controls inoperative. Reaching into the breast</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his shirt he withdrew two folded packets and handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to Ben.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Gas masks!" exclaimed the mechanic. "You think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything, don't you ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Have to," Pete grinned as he adjusted the protec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive device over his head. "Come on now, let's go!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were out in the station then, climbing over piles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bodies, some still squirming in their death agonies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">others inert. The gas of the Akata was powerful stuff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A NARROW passage led from the station into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"navy yard," as Pete had called it, and they slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">through cautiously until they came to the entrance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great chamber. Two guards were on duty at this point</seg><seg type="columnLine">and each of the Americans selected one, pouncing upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from behind and with quick grasps of their wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipes throttling any possible outcry. They dragged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures into the passage and despatched them quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and silently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now they were in the huge chamber among the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanks. They skirted one of the outer walls to keep out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sight of any of the watchmen who might be around.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If only they could reach their destination before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchers arrived!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The lone tank which faced the giant airlock loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">before them in the semi-darkness. None of the Akata</seg><seg type="columnLine">TANKS UNDER THE SEA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">907</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was in sight. Pete sneaked along beside one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">caterpillar tracks until he reached the open manhole</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the vessel. Then they were inside and undetected</seg><seg type="columnLine">So far, so good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the work of but a moment to clamp the her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">metically sealed cover and pull the switch that turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on all lights in the mighty war machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How're we going to get out?" asked Ben.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cut our way through. Come on--up to the forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">turret."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A tremendous shock threw them flat. The tank seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have jumped a foot in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was that?" Ben turned a white face toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">his partner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The magazine," Pete grinned. "Never think we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could've done all this in ten minutes, would you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there came a roaring rumble which echoed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverberated in the huge cavern outside, coming to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears even through the thick double hull of the sub-tank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Geez!" muttered Ben. "Some bust-up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And how! I'll bet fourteen levels were caved in over</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that section and I know of three air-conditioning</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants that'll be out of commission from the blast. That'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep 'em guessing for some time and maybe give us</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance to do some things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They climbed the ladder in the central well of the sub</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made their way to the forward turret. Pete ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amined the ray projectors and selected one, a shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of tubing with many handwheels and gadgets on</seg><seg type="columnLine">its mounting. He had carefully inquired regarding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation of these weapons and now pulled a lever that</seg><seg type="columnLine">projected from the control box alongside. The rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">whine of a great generator answered from somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the thick glass of the observation port they</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched as the fusing beam cut into the heavy metal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the airlock ahead. As it bored through with a shower of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinding sparks, Pete manipulated the controls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam to cut away a huge circle just inside the rim of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ben peered through one of the side ports and let out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">yell that resounded terrifyingly in the narrow confines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the turret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a gang in the cavern!" he shouted. "They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">manning one of the other tanks!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Swing that other projector around and give 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">hell!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How?" Ben was nonplussed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Works just like this one, you dumb-bell. Hop to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">now!" Pete roared impatiently. Ben was a trial at</seg><seg type="columnLine">times. Couldn't he see that he was too busy with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting process to explain?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The inner door of the airlock fell in with a crash.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now the beam was at work on the outer. He won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered if the inrushing water would quench the terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat of the beam. Now it was through at one point and</seg><seg type="columnLine">no water entered. Building up steam pressure outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably and that would hold back the water despite its</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred pounds pressure to the square inch. Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">no--it was disintegrating the brine as fast as it poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">through--that was it. He wondered how Ben was</seg><seg type="columnLine">making out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Water was coming in now, through the narrow slit</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the point where the beam was cutting--lots of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. But the beam still operated; it was cutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster and faster. Soon they'd be through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The outer door was driven in by the tremendous pres-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of the water before its last section was cut through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thousands of tons of Pacific Ocean came in with it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sub-tank was tossed about like a cork. Pete was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown violently across the turret and his head struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">something hard. He staggered to his feet and made for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the control room in a daze. Dimly it came to him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben was down and out--bleeding like a pig. Poor old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HARDLY knowing what he was doing, he yanked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lever that started the main generators. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">answering rumble below told him that all was well with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machinery. He tried to remember the uses of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">various controls; pulled this and twisted that until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew they were moving forward. The brilliant beams</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the searchlights illuminated the jagged openings</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. They were crawling through on their great</seg><seg type="columnLine">caterpillars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wiped the blood from his eyes and cursed. Ben</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dead--good old Ben. But already he was avenged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The incoming waters would drown the Akata in droves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly and miserably. He wished he could hear them</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeal. Overrun the Americas, would they ? He thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleefully of those torrents that now were pouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">through every passage and chamber of Aka. Finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would reach down to the deepest levels and flow to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the farthest corners of the realm. Every one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirty beasts would perish. And he, Pete Caldwell, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have killed seven millions of them, if the figures were</seg><seg type="columnLine">right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sub-tank was moving faster now over the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">even bottom. He reached for the control lever of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ballast pump motors. Suddenly he yearned for a breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">of outside air. God! The lever was broken off short!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pumps could not be operated. He would die on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom--miserably, like the Akata.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he thought of the tank which was being made</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to follow them. Maybe Ben had not been able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to put them out of commission with that ray projector.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And even one of the damned things could do a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">damage up above. He swung the great bulk of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">sub around by reversing one of the caterpillars. Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure as hell and high water, there it was! Just poking</seg><seg type="columnLine">its nose out from the destroyed airlock. He remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered one of the ray projectors that was operative under</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Lucky he'd asked about that. Bringing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls to neutral he dashed for the turret once more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he reached the battery of ray projectors and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered through the port he saw that a slender pencil</seg><seg type="columnLine">of orange light already was extending from the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">sub-tank. Playing over the metal hull of his own vessel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was. That would be the under-water beam. Savagely</seg><seg type="columnLine">he jerked at the controls of the one projector he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">use in the circumstances. Another beam of light sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth and he directed it at the turret from which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other was coming. There was a flash at the far end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the beam and suddenly the first one was snuffed out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had put it out of commission at the first try. Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lentlessly he bored into the sides of the other amphibian;</seg><seg type="columnLine">bored and bored with the ray until he saw a large section</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hull fuse away and admit the waters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got 'em, thank God!" he exclaimed fervently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's the last of the scum now, for sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whadju say?" a feeble voice mumbled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ben!" It was Ben. He hadn't kicked in after all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he would--later. Lord! He must break it to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">908</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gently. Water was coming in now too. Down below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the devils had bored through the hull. That would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it a little quicker anyhow. But Ben--Ben was</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a helpless bird and so dependent on him for every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing; he hated to think he'd have to fail him now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ben," he was saying as he felt over his body for</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken bones or serious wounds. "You all right, old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. Just knocked out, that's all. But I didn't get</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sub-tank."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't worry about that. It's all right, Ben."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Everything okay?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Y-yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then let's go home." Ben sat up and propped him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self against the curved wall of the turret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ben, we can't. The ballast pumps won't work and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides, there's water coming in. We're stuck . . . down</seg><seg type="columnLine">here . . . old man . . . done for, the two of us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His friend stared blankly for a moment. "Why, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonehead," he said slowly, "what's the matter with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in the super-structure? You know--the detach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able life boat affair they told us about?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ben had put one over on him at last. Pete did some</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring on his own account; then hugged his friend de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liriously. He'd forgotten this safety feature himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good old Ben!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TWENTY minutes 'later they were on the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had unbolted the deck cover of the small boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had entered through its clever air-locked attachment</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sub-tank. It had shot to the world of sunlight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh air like a bullet when the release levers inside were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They breathed deep for a long time without talking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was good to be back to their own world, even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were all in and a mighty long way from land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Pete told of the fight with the other sub-tank</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ben told how he had failed in the first attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck it. It seemed there was one thing about the arma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment they had not known, for an invisible wall of pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tective vibrations of some kind had been thrown around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marvelous machine before the water came in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rays struck harmless against this barrier. Appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently the barrier could not be used under water, though,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so Pete had been successful later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, it was a good job as it turned out," Pete</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloated, "and we're mighty lucky to be here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Long way from land, though," Ben objected, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtfully at the oars and striving hard to keep from</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodding into a doze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete was as exhausted as his friend but he dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to the provision locker and rummaged around</seg><seg type="columnLine">amongst its contents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ought to be a sail in the equipment somewhere," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted from the depths of the locker. "Found a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">mast. Plenty of groub and fresh water too. We'll make</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Three hundred miles to Auckland?" Ben contem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plated the effort with dismay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete grinned sheepishly when he came up from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">investigation of the locker. "Guess my reckoning was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty punk," he admitted. "A look at Chevan's chart</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed me that we are only a little more than a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from that port. They picked us up right about</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, you know, and I was wrong on the distance."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, my estimate on the gas wasn't so hot either,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Ben. "Thought fifty gallons'd give out on us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop us in the drink before we were half way there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was farther off than you were."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete had located the sail and they prepared to step</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here you," growled Ben, noting that his friend was</seg><seg type="columnLine">groggy. "You got a nasty cut on your head. Better</seg><seg type="columnLine">let me wash it and fix it up for you first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't use too much of the drinking water," Pete</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned, sitting down weakly and submitting to Ben's</seg><seg type="columnLine">administrations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a case of the blind leading the blind. Both were</seg><seg type="columnLine">so worn out they could scarcely sit up--too dazed even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to marvel at their extraordinary experiences of the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">week--too tired even to give thanks for their miraculous</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eventually, everything was in shape; the sail set and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiller lashed with beckets. They talked things over</seg><seg type="columnLine">in drowsy tones as the thirty foot lifeboat plowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a moderately choppy sea toward Auckland.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll make it in a day, if the breeze holds out," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Easy. Glad I was wrong with my reckoning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ben broke the silence again, after a moment. "What'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">we tell 'em, Pete ?" he asked, lazily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell who?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Everybody.

Bone grafts are not infrequent, so there is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason why it is not practical to change arms, or at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">an arm. There is, today, in England, a surgeon who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely approached this operation. He has just recently</seg><seg type="columnLine">performed two similar operations. Both cases were much</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same. The patients simply having lost their thumbs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surgeon re-amputated the thumb just below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stump and taking the ring finger of the same, or op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite hand, substituted it for the stump. In both cases</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were excellent results and the grafted finger func-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned perfectly.

Happily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I intend to make this resection, in the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the biceps muscle, there are only two important vessels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brachial artery and the basilic vein; the other vessels</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be neglected as circulation is easily carried on by</seg><seg type="columnLine">these two. There will remain then six large nerves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which may prove difficult, and only four muscles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the humerus.

The shock to his aesthetic mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost overpowering. The thought of a black hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">was revolting, but the thought of no hand at all was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">death itself. Would the hand be large and awkward or</seg><seg type="columnLine">would it be slender and sensitive? Was it coal black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or only a light mulatto? Could he ever return to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">society with such a stigma? These and many others</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the thoughts he pondered over, and after what</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed like only a few minutes, Dr. Evans was back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VAN PUYSTER seemed haggard and worn when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor asked for his decision. He gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sigh and said, "Go ahead, doc, I've lost all the fight I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever had."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Evans stepped to the door and two orderlies en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered with a stretcher to take him to the ambulance wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing outside. "The operation has to take place at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prison," was the doctor's exposition. "The governor</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he could not give permission for the removal of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">negro. It seems there is some law against it." He took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a silver case from his coat pocket and withdrew there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a minute hypodermic syringe. Van Puyster looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on with expression akin to horror. "It's all right," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor said. "This is just a preoperative shot. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly painless and contains morphine, atrophine, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scopalomine. The morphine is used as an anesthetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sudorific, the atropine and scopalomine as stimu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lants, and the scopalomine has also a sudorific effect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These ingredients greatly reduce the shock of the opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and, in the argot of the street, when you enter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operating room, 'it doesn't matter, to you, if the cabbage</seg><seg type="columnLine">never heads.' I guess I'll have to leave you now, but I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">see you later at the prison. I'll have to scrub up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the last minute details prepared by the time of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your arrival."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Van Puyster arrived, he was pleasantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowsy. He did not even notice that the aniulance did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not drive at its usual breakneck speed. He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice when he was put on the wheeled stretcher to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken to the operating room. In that room itself, he did</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not notice how far different it was from the usual type.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The walls instead of being in the glaring white as is so</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevalent, were of soft powder blue. The floor was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm gray and covered with a seamless, waterproof</seg><seg type="columnLine">compound which yielded slightly to the tread, thus re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducing fatigue and resultant errors. All the fixtures in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room, including the table itself, were of gray. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gowns were of the selfsame color--gray--and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of dragging the floor on the smaller nurses, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing the knee of the anesthetist, who was abnormally</seg><seg type="columnLine">large, by three inches, each person had his individual</seg><seg type="columnLine">gown, which hung a uniform six inches above the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The skylight was of thin translucent glass which filtered</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the hard irritating sun rays, but transmitted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultra-violet rays which are so destructive to microscopic</seg><seg type="columnLine">organisms. The operating light itself was contained in</seg><seg type="columnLine">frosted crystal and lighted the field perfectly, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">undue hardship on the surgeons' eyes. These innova-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, which the doctor often liked to explain to visitors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were his own, and as the surroundings had a soothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect on all within their influence, the mortality from</seg><seg type="columnLine">operations within this amphitheater was considerably less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that in the usual white operating room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Van Puyster was wheeled in and as he was placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the table the anesthetist asked, "What shall I use,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Use ethylene. I think it will be best for this opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion because it gives excellent anesthesia with no disa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeable after effect and the patient succumbs to its in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluences almost immediately."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mask was fitted over his face and the ethylene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen mixture turned on. In a few seconds the regu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar rhythm of his breathing showed that he was asleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The negro was already anesthetized in another room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now wheeled in and placed on a table beside him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sites of operation were sterilized with picric acid</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution and ether, and the infected arm carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandaged so none of the infected material could possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">get to the clean areas. Tourniquets were applied both</seg><seg type="columnLine">above and below the sites of incision to prevent the loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blood. The drapes were applied and Dr. Evans and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his assistant, Dr. Aquino, who had been previously in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed as to the procedure, each began his incisions</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a marvelous high frequency knife. This instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, which derives its energy from the three-electrode</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacuum tube, works on the principle of molecular dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">integration. The energy from the high frequency cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rents disintegrates the tissues in its path and leaves a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean wound behind. After the double amputation, Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evans and Dr. Aquino began the union of the black arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the white.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine black silk arterial suture, please," asked Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evans.

Dr. Aquino," he continued in his finest didactic</seg><seg type="columnLine">style, "has cut the vessels and nerves long enough so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that suturing may be easily accomplished. We will first</seg><seg type="columnLine">unite the ends of the brachial artery.

"For instance," he went on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"if that body were not traveling through Space, its world-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line would extend only into Time, or the Four Dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, as some people call it.

That is, the one point--x\' x\' x\'</seg><seg type="columnLine">x\'--will be in the future of our designated point,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the other--x2 x3 x4 --will be in the past.

Now--here's where we get to the core</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the matter: Do you know that the Fourth Dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion need not necessarily be time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I	stared at him blankly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It makes no difference whether or not we regard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Fourth Dimension as time," Brockhurst went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a moment. "To all practical purposes the Fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dimension and Time are identical. But--according to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain scientist named Turner, the Fourth Dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion is not time, but a certain constant multiplied by</seg><seg type="columnLine">time! And that constant is the velocity of light. Thus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we let w represent the fourth dimension of space, we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have:	w-ct,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">where c is the velocity of light--186,000 miles per sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond--and t is any period of time we choose to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Since velocity is distance divided by time, we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">make this equation a little more specific by writing it</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way:	w-(l/t)t,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in which I is the unit of distance--186,000 mile;;--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">t is the time required for light to cover that distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or one second. From this we can see that every body</seg><seg type="columnLine">travels 186,000 miles into the Fourth Dimension every</seg><seg type="columnLine">second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Upon this assertion of Dr. Turner I based certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculations of my own, which eventually culminated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time machine here. I won't go into the details</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> right now, but, briefly, it occurred to me that those</seg><seg type="columnLine">equations I just gave you were subject to relativity;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a particle's velocity through space must also influ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence its progress along the Fourth Dimension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Time as we know it is not universally absolute. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate of its passage depends to a great extent upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity of its observer with regard to some certain ref-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erence system. A moving clock will run slower with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect to a selected co-ordinate system than a sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionary one. According to the Lorentz-Fitzgerald for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mula, the 'time' of either clock is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   t</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        T -- --...............</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                       y/l -- ir/c'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">where t is the clock's rate when it is stationary, v is its</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity through space, and c is the velocity of light."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brockhurst stopped in order to shift his position.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he resumed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me give you an example. Imagine two asteroids</seg><seg type="columnLine">in space, 161,000 miles apart. For the sake of sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicity we will assume they are stationary in space, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least in relation to each other. On one of these aster-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oids, which we will call A, we place two observers hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing watches which run at the same rate when at rest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One observer, O, has a space-flier capable of attaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous speeds. Now at a given instant, which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same for both observers, O starts his space-flier and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the velocity of 161,000 miles per second flies from</seg><seg type="columnLine">asteroid A to asteroid B. The second observer, S, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maining on A, watches and times the flight of his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion, remarking that exactly one second is required</seg><seg type="columnLine">for O to make his trip from A to B. O, however, like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise times his trip, and he finds that only half a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">was needed for the journey. The reason, of course is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his watch ran only half as fast as normally while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was flying through space from A to B.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now this idea, it occurred to me, must also apply</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Turner's suggestion of the Fourth Dimension. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is no absolute time in the world, there is no abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lute gauge wherewith to measure our progress along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fourth Dimension! The corrected equation then, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes	,, ,rj, ..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                  _ w -- (l/T)t,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">t being the rate of time-passage to a stationary particle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and T being the rate of a moving particle.

It is simply that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no absolute rate of motion into the Fourth Dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion ! Time, Or more accurately, passage through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fourth Dimension, as far as concerns any particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, depends upon the velocity of that particle through</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. If its velocity equals that of light, there is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent passage of time, as measured from that body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the velocity is zero the rate of time-passage is at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">maximum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That idea forms the basis of my time machine. Par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticles traveling through space at different velocities have</seg><seg type="columnLine">different extensions into the Fourth Dimension. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">VIA THE TIME ACCELERATOR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">915</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to do in order to travel into the future or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past of a certain world-point is to alter one's velocity</seg><seg type="columnLine">with reference to that point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The only way in which we seemed likely to accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plish this was through particle vibration. No appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent passage of time can be measured from an atom, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">other particle, which does not vibrate. Time becomes</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexistent to that particle. Thus a particle which is vi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brating at a certain rate has a different space-time re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lationship than a second particle vibrating at some other</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequency. The two particles pass through the Fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dimension at different velocities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Having this idea in mind, I constructed that elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trical machinery which you see attached to the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the plane, between the wheels. That is the real time</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine, and it does nothing more nor less than so alter</seg><seg type="columnLine">the period of vibration of the protons and electrons</seg><seg type="columnLine">composing the plane, its occupant, and the time machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, that their rate of progress through the Fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dimension can be controlled at will; that is, the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be made to occupy different moments of 'time' at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desire of the operator. There! That's the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">long and short of it! The time-traveler sits in the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and starts the electric vibrator, regulates its frequency</seg><seg type="columnLine">to suit himself, and moves back and forth through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fourth Dimension, from world-point to world-point, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lists."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why attach the machine to an airplane?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, deeply impressed by Brockhurst's words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For safety's sake. This time machine is also a bona</seg><seg type="columnLine">fide airplane, and when traveling through 'time' it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">high above ground.

No--the safest course is to be up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air when time-traveling, so that upon arriving at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's destination one can move about as one desires,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without fear of drowning or being crushed under tons</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rock."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a while we sat and stared at the plane. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I rose and went over to inspect it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you ever travel in 'time' with it, Brockhurst?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stopped and glared at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yet you seem pretty all-fired sure it will work.

Your mathematics may tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">it'll work all right, but will it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will," Brockhurst assured me. "I know.

"Tomor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row morning at 9:30 A. M.

In a minute he was taxying swiftly across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open field behind his house, soon-rising into the quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">air and heading eastward. He spiraled up to about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards above the ground; then I saw a battery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of electron-tubes in the time machine on the craft's bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom flash into light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a while they glowed brightly as the plane droned</seg><seg type="columnLine">along its circular path overhead; but presently I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that their light was dimming, and that something was</seg><seg type="columnLine">happening to the plane. The throbbing roar of its en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gine was becoming duller--and then before my very</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes the craft grew indistinct and vanished, dissolving</seg><seg type="columnLine">into nothingness, like the figment of a dream!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet even as the ship disappeared in the empty sky, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard behind me the sound of a wheeled vehicle racing</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the ground; and spinning on my heel I beheld in</seg><seg type="columnLine">unutterable amazement, 'Brockhurst's time-machine roll</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a halt a few paces distant! But was it the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft? I peered at it more intently. Yes, it was--no,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not! Still--! By heaven, it was at that! Worn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stained, coated with the gray, impalpable dust of count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less centuries, braced and bound together by metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">strips that it might not fall apart, still it was the same.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In spite of its vastly changed appearance, some inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice assured me of the fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To corroborate my inward assurance, the glass door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cabin opened, and out clambered--Brockhurst.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But how changed!

Was it not, I questioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, the height of folly thus to tamper with the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finite mysteries of Time and Space--to thrust myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the coming centuries to a period yet uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived, with conditions still unconjectured? After all--</seg><seg type="columnLine">would the experiment prove successful? To be sure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had sent a small model of my time machine into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fourth Dimension; but so paradoxical, so grotesque, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">unreal did the entire matter appear that my reason re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused to accept the testimony of mathematics and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periment. And granting that success did attend my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairbrained undertaking, what circumstances, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurrences awaited me in the distant eon I was setting</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth to visit?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Might I not come to a period where human life was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible on the world? Or might I not enter an era</seg><seg type="columnLine">when humanity was subjugated by some mightier type</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life? Might not I perish in the course of my time-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voyage, or in the age I was intending to visit? Would</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ever return to the present?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had already closed the switch that started the time-</seg><seg type="columnLine">accelerator attached to the plane, but so strongly did</seg><seg type="columnLine">these various questions prey upon my mind that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorely tempted to open the circuit again and abstain *</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my foolhardy idea of flying into a future era.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet, as my hand lingered on the insulated handle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch my eye caught something in the serene blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens to my left. I looked. First only a dim, indis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinct blur was discernible; but swiftly it materialized</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a definite, concrete shape--it was an airplane, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">between its landing-wheels I descried a compact ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine, which even at that distance, I recognized as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time-machine. My time-machine, attached to the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane in which even now I rode! Evidently, then, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going into the Fourth Dimension and I was coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">back--for had I not just seen myself return out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fourth Dimension, and commence to glide down toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own house?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That decided me. All my doubts were answered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">allayed. All would be well. So I turned the dial that</seg><seg type="columnLine">regulated the vibratory rate of the time machine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my plane, and in a few more seconds I was slipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly into the Future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paradoxical? I should say! I had seen myself re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn from my time-trip before I had started it; had I</seg><seg type="columnLine">not seen that return I would not have commenced that</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange journey, and so could not have returned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to induce me to decide that I would make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the time machine beneath the fuselage of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane was fairly in action the world that lay below be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a blurred mass of ever-changing shades. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the ground beneath me heaved and swelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a stormy sea as with the passing centuries its level</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose and fell. Gray and silent, like the spectres of long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead worlds and civilizations, towering buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed into and out of existence! Mighty cities spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dwindled like fog before the sun. Forests and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lakes, rivers and hills flitted through Time below me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentary landmarks in the course of the ages, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rushing by my plane. Outside my machine, time</seg><seg type="columnLine">was speeding past at incredible velocity, but within my</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft it passed as normally as ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no distinction between day and night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Overhead stretched a deep blue haze, through which a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad, silver-gold band marked the progress of the sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the most fascinating thing to me was to watch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress of the stars. At the speed with which I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting through the fourth dimension they showed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine silver lines circling, curling, spiraling and streaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the blue skies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For what to me seemed like about half an hour I</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintained this rate of passage along the fourth dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">VIA THE TIME ACCELERATOR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">917</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sion; then at length I determined to halt my machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inspect the world of the future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the start of my journey I had set my auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic controls to stop after the passage of one million</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomical years, and as the figures on my dials</seg><seg type="columnLine">neared this number I commenced to decrease the vibra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional action of the time-accelerator, slowing down my</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlong flight through time, until, when my instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments registered the passing of one million years, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw open the switch and came to a halt in the fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimension--or to be more precise, reduced my velocity</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it to that with which you are moving through</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Then I gazed out of the plane to see what appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance was presented by the world of 1,001,930 A. D.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And what a scene I looked upon!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fading away to the horizon on every hand stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vast, level, sandy plain, bathed in the reddish light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the low-hanging afternoon sun. A range of low, crum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling red cliffs lay on the northern edge of the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming a natural barrier between earth and sky. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween me and the distant cliffs the sandy plain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dotted with immense green things of globular appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, which I took to be plants of some nature. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumption was soon to be verified.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then as my craft circled around to head south my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes discovered the most interesting thing of all--there</seg><seg type="columnLine">below and before me, its hither edge not more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile distant, sprawled a mighty city of titanic, blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone structures! Grim and massive, like medieval feu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dal castles, save that they were more squat and solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">in appearance, hundreds of those great buildings stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent and sombre in the bloody glow of the dying sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No sign of life could I detect in their vicinity--no hurry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing throngs, no wisp of smoke, no sound of traffic or</seg><seg type="columnLine">industry. To all appearances the city was deserted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shutting off the motor of my plane, I descended to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the city in a long, gentle glide, intently studying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange structures as I did so. The conviction that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city had long been forsaken and crumbling into</seg><seg type="columnLine">decay became ever stronger as I neared it and the edi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fices at its edge became more distinct. Yes--for dec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ades, possibly for centuries, few if any living beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">had occupied that once mighty center of a vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization. Then I slightly drew back the control rod</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my plane, the wheels bumped once or twice over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand, and I rolled to a stop about a hundred yards from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearest of the massive buildings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tentatively I poked my head out of my cabin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniffed. The air, though a trifle thinner than in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twentieth century, was of a very exhilarating quality,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which led me to presume that it possibly contained an</seg><seg type="columnLine">excess percentage of oxygen. I could see no form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life about me with the exception of the immense, ball-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped plants, so I stepped out upon the level sand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meditate upon a course of procedure. Now that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">here in the year 1,001,930, what was to be done?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air of mystery--of incredibly ancient mystery--</seg><seg type="columnLine">which prevailed over the enormous city at my side</seg><seg type="columnLine">captured me, so I had little to ponder concerning my</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediate course of action. The city stood there await-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me, and it would be silly to neglect the opportunity</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explore it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly, closing the door of the airplane cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind me, I set out to investigate the silent, ominous</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins that brooded on the desert before me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On my way, I took occasion to give more careful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to the scattered globular plants that grew out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sandy earth. They were, as I believe I have already</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned, a very dark green in color, enormous in size,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranging from eighteen to twenty feet in diameter. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bottoms grew hundreds and hundreds of long, thin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicate pink tentacles that were apparently roots, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">they extended into the soil. I observed that the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">globes themselves did not rest upon the ground, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stationed about two or three feet above it, seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly supported by the countless dozens of pink roots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It appeared ridiculous, however, to imagine that those</seg><seg type="columnLine">frail, slender, supple tentacles could possibly support</seg><seg type="columnLine">those gigantic globes, so I perforce surmised that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">globes themselves were hollow and filled with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighter-than-air gas--being, in fact, natural balloons</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchored by the pink roots. That this supposition was</seg><seg type="columnLine">correct I was soon to learn--unpleasantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My walk to the city was leisurely and somewhat cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tious; I always remained in a direct line with my plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I might flee to it in the event of necessity, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I felt certain that no danger threatened from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crumbling city, still I did not blind myself to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that there was a chance that it was inhabited</seg><seg type="columnLine">by creatures who might entertain hostile intentions to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I have already stated, at the time of my arrival</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this future day it was already late in the afternoon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun hanging upon the lip of the western horizon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I was still some fifty feet from the nearest struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture--a gigantic, cubicular affair topped by several flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">topped round towers--the last rays of the Day Star</seg><seg type="columnLine">faded away altogether, leaving the world in a twilight</seg><seg type="columnLine">that swiftly grew into dusk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this I halted to reconsider my intention of explor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the ancient city. My curiosity concerning it spurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">in me a desire to examine it by torchlight, if necessary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while common sense urged me to refrain from foolish</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceedings and wait for the morrow. And while I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood thus deliberating, I suddenly felt a soft, caressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch upon the back of my neck--and then another</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon my cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a start I spun around, facing my plane--only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stagger back in amazement at what I beheld. Hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing low in the evening air behind and above me was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the monstrous, globular plants, a mighty dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">green ball fully eighteen feet in diameter! Hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its slender, pink, whip-like lashes dangled from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom, forming a writhing net of menacing cords,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while from among them a long, sinuous green trunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended from the gas-distended globe to the level sand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its lower end terminating in a sucking, cup-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth that evidently acted as a natural vacuum-cup to</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchor the floating plant to the ground!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dozen thin pink "roots" uncurled and stretched out</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward me, and again I felt their questioning caress on</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat, creek and brow. A qualm of nausea, of unutter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able loathing, swept over me; then with a low, inarticu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late cry I dodged aside to flee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But ere I had taken a step the floating plant whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward me upon its sinuous trunk, and of a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was inextricably entangled in all the hundreds of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgusting, writhing, snake-like whiplashes--some no</seg><seg type="columnLine">thicker than a needle, others more than an inch in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter and possessed of a strength comparable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the boa constrictor!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a babe in the arms of a strong man I was lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">918</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">high into the air by the monstrous, malignant plant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the fury of unreasoning terror I struggled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my gigantic, soulless captor, shouting, biting, wriggling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kicking with all my power; but my efforts availed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me nothing save to exhaust me and enmesh me the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the merciless grip of those crushing tentacles. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothwere ripped to tatters, blue swellings and bloody</seg><seg type="columnLine">cu' 3 showed on my skin where the rope-like arms of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gieat plant had squeezed and torn my body. Torn--</seg><seg type="columnLine">yes--torn! Several of the tentacles, that strange fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught me, had fine, needle-like spikes near their ends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which scratched and cut me in dozens of places!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I discovered that the monstrous plant had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground and was slowly floating upward, while doz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ens of small, sucking mouths attached themselves to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open wounds of my body, to draw in the life-blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">that flowed from them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A groan of dismay broke from me. Was this to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">my fate--to die out here in this man-forsaken era,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the sucking lips of a vampire that belonged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the realms of hell? No--no! I couldn't die that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Somewhere I had a large-bladed pocket-knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my possession; if only I could get it--!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anew I began to fight and struggle, my hand work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing gradually toward my right hip pocket. The beast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant that held me constricted its powerful arms, crush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my ribs together and wrapping a choking tentacle</seg><seg type="columnLine">around my neck. Soon my breath was stopped and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head commenced to reel; my vision became blurred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">misty; my eyes watered profusely. Lord! I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight any longer--!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somehow my fingers gripped the knife that lay in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pocket; with one hand I opened both its blades, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I started to cut. Vaguely I felt the blades encounter</seg><seg type="columnLine">yielding surfaces, and presently the pressure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entangling lashes began to lessen. At last my right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand was free. Already I hung on the brink of uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness when my knife at length found the pitiless</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentacle which was throttling the life from me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">commenced to saw upon it. Luckily the strand was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender one, so it took but a few moments ere it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sundered and the deadly pressure against my throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">was relieved. Unwrapping the coiled arm of the plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">from about my neck I flung it away, to return then</seg><seg type="columnLine">to severing the remainder of the writhing lashes. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">what seemed hours of frantic slashing, the strongest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them were cut through, while the lesser of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not sufficiently powerful to restrain me from</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking loose. Released of their tight clutch I slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward through the writhing net and plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily to the sand beneath--free!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the course of my aerial battle with it, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying plant had floated a number of yards eastward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascending to an altitude of eighteen or twenty feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My drop of some twelve feet to the smooth, packed</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand underfoot had considerably shaken and bruised</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, leaving me trembling and exhausted as I lay half</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead upon the ground. My teeth chattered in my shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering, as I thought, with cold sweat exuding from</seg><seg type="columnLine">every pore of my body, of the grisly fate that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just escaped by the barest of margins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I had slightly recovered my breath and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength I grasped my knife and staggered giddily to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feet. Then I turned to the time machine resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the desert a hundred yards away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I had not taken two steps in its direction when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I halted, my heart leaping. Clustered around the plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their long, pink, snake-like tentacles running inquisi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively over it from end to end, were fully a dozen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the titanic globular plants. Others hung in the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">over it, or between me and the plane, while several</seg><seg type="columnLine">were drifting slowly toward me!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shouted hoarsely, then turned about and fled pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cipitately to the shelter of the nearest great building</seg><seg type="columnLine">that loomed ominously out of the gathering gloom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here I stumbled up a low series of steps and plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a rectangular, crumbling stone aperture that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave entrance to the structure. Within, I found myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a long, dust-covered corridor, dirtily lighted by a row</seg><seg type="columnLine">of small, grimy, luminous glass globes. That the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been in disuse for a long period was amply testified</seg><seg type="columnLine">to by the cracked walls, the many broken lights, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gray dust that lay inch-thick upon the uneven floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turning into the first doorway at my left I entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dimly-lighted rectangular room of sizable dimensions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparsely furnished with an age-old table and a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs, while against one wall stood a low, broad couch</seg><seg type="columnLine">piled with ancient cloths. Apparently in some bygone</seg><seg type="columnLine">day this had been the apartment of some long-dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabitant of this desolate, decaying city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the nearest chair I sat down to speculate. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation in which I found myself certainly was not an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enviable one. I was without food or drink in a world-</seg><seg type="columnLine">old pile of ruins where there possibly existed not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single drop of water or a crumb of bread. Weapons</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had none save my puny pocket-knife, and surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the city on every hand were countless hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense, formidable vampire-plants, any one of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood an excellent chance of bringing about my doom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My precious time machine was effectively guarded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">those enormous flying beast-plants, so I had practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">no chance whatever to reach the plane, let alone escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet--I would escape with it, for all that. It was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">decreed. Had I not, with my own eyes, seen myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear out of the fourth dimension back there in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twentieth Century, and glide down to my landing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field? Surely then, I was destined to return to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own age safe and sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then my ears caught a soft, stealthy sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind me, like the tread of a padded foot. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumping heart I spun around in my chair, my imagi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation picturing weird and terrible creatures creeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon me from behind. But the very fact that my eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaited some amazingly unusual entity, some awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of monstrous form, caused me to be only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more astonished at what I beheld, for that which met</seg><seg type="columnLine">my gaze was the most commonplace thing in the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">--it was a man. Yet so incongruous, so utterly foreign</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the familiar and commonplace seem in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">grotesque, unreal world, that I was prone to attribute</seg><seg type="columnLine">his presence to some trick of my own imagination.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, despite all that, he was real.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old and wrinkled, toothless and bald he was, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a coffee-brown skin whose texture suggested leather.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stood about five feet nine in height, clad in a simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">white cloth tunic lashed about his waist by a broad belt</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which depended two pockets, one at each hip.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">The one contained a long knife, the other a contrivance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that appeared to be some form of revolver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A minute passed during which the strange man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I regarded each other in silence. Then he spoke--in</seg><seg type="columnLine">VIA THE TIME ACCELERATOR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">919</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a tongue that despite its odd accent and unfamiliar pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nunciation I recognized as English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you Anton Brockhurst?" were the old fellow's</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that I almost sat down on the floor. "What?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried in utter amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you Anton Brockhurst?" he repeated. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be. My history tells me that there was but one</seg><seg type="columnLine">man alive on earth when Anton Brockhurst came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the past in his time machine. I am the last man!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore you must be Brockhurst!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Honestly, you could have knockcd me over with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feather. So astounded, so utterly flabbergasted did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient one's words leave me that I could but stand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gape at him in thunder-stricken silence. I was gasping</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a fish out of the water as I slowly gathered my wits</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reply to the old man's speech. At last I was able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to articulate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What--what--how . . . Yes, I am- Anton Brock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurst, but how do you know my name?" I stammered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Have--have we met before? I--I'm afraid I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">place you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Imagine me jawing such ridiculous rot to a man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives a million years after us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old fellow smiled at my evident perplexity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought so--I knew so," he said. "When I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet the last human being on earth I learned from</seg><seg type="columnLine">my history tablets, which were written about five hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred thousand years ago, that one Anton Brockhurst,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a native of the year 1930 A. D., built a time machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which he traveled a million years into the future,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he found the Last Man. The Last Man, desir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to see others of his kind before he died, prevailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Brockhurst to return with him, in the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine, into the Past--to the year 502,101 A. D.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the machine's arrival was duly recorded in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">histories. When the Last Man was born, half a mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion years later, he read those histories, and thus he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows now that his rescuer is named Brockhurst. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">very simple, is it not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sitting weakly on my chair, I nodded. My mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tumbling with doubts and wonderings. Once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was confronted by one of the inexplicable paradoxes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time'traveling. Here this man had learned my name</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I told it to him; he had learned his own future</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it transpired, through history books written half</seg><seg type="columnLine">a million years before his birth, and yet that future of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his could not have been written into the histories of</seg><seg type="columnLine">502,101 A. D. if it had not first occurred!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tiredly I shook my head; the riddle was too deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me. Yes--even for me, the man who invented the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time machine!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But--but," said I at length, "I don't know if I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">take you with me into the Past. My time machine is</seg><seg type="columnLine">constructed to accommodate but one person."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you must take me with you! You will take</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with you! I know it! You cannot desert me here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this God-forsaken, manless age! Tell me, tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you will take me with you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'll see what I can do," I promised. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">frankly, I don't see how I'm going to do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you will find a way. The history books say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I did come to the year 502,101. I want to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">other humans once more before I die. For nearly sixty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years I have been the last representative of our kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the earth. Yes, you must find a way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll try," I assured him, and for a long time we</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapsed into silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where--where am I?" I finally inquired. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">city is this, and to whom does it belong? How old</seg><seg type="columnLine">is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the city of Kur," responded the Last Man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing up a second chair and dropping into it. "It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a remnant of the Last Civilization, which began about</seg><seg type="columnLine">six hundred thousand years ago and reached its hey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day around 550,000 A. D. A hundred and fifty thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand years later, at about 700,000 A. D., it began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">decline, and by 900,000 A. D. it was almost completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiped out. It destroyed itself as all its predecessors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prehistoric civilizations, destroyed themselves. Greed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and avarice, lust for power, oppression of the weak and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rebellion of the untutored--it is the same old circle over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and over again. They rise, they flourish, and they fall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When the wars and revolutions had blotted out cul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, art, and science, the peoples of the earth were</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduced to the savagery from which they had sprung;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then it was the advent of the Martian vampire-plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">that completed the ghastly story by killing off the igno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rant, unprotected barbarians who once had been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lords of the Earth. In the last hundred thousand years</seg><seg type="columnLine">the toll of human lives taken by flying plants was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous that the perpetuation of the race was placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopelessly into the shadow. Now you see the result--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am the Last Man. Up to sixty years ago there still</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained three or four of us, but the others, too, died of</seg><seg type="columnLine">old age or were captured unawares by the floating plants</seg><seg type="columnLine">and killed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The flying plants--they are of Martian origin?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. The Last Man nodded in reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have had an unpleasant experience with one myself,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went on; "I gather from their appearance that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are hollow and filled with a lighter-than-air gas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quite so," agreed the Last Man with a nod. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are filled with hydrogen gas, which they extract from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water-vapor in the air and also from the moisture</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ground. It is their presence which has made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert of our world. Even our oceans are fast receding</seg><seg type="columnLine">before them. In a hundred thousand more years there</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be no more water on Earth. They are transforming</seg><seg type="columnLine">our entire planet to a vast desert, just as they have trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed Mars to a desert. The gigantic waterways built</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their planet by the ancient Martians are covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iiuge swarms of these plants, seeking to drain up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last few drops of water so that the hydrogen may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">extracted and stored in their hollow bodies. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same reason they attack animals, or other plants con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining water--to suck forth the liquid, expel the oxygen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and retain the hydrogen that they may float around more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wonder to what purpose all their mad blood-greed is.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seems to me that their existence must be as aimless as</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that of Man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Evidently the fact that you are the Last Man has</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed you in a position to judge your species," said I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wishing the old fellow's philosophy were less pessimistic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"knowing the faults and foolish deeds of your ances-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Last Man smirked. "And having nothing to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward to," he rejoined. "When I am dead--then</seg><seg type="columnLine">what ? The human race has come and gone, with nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look forward to," he rejoined. "When I am dead--</seg><seg type="columnLine">then what? The human race has come and gone, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to mark its one-time glory, its might, and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">920</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">world importance except a few old piles of crumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">masonry that soon will follow their builders to the primal</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust whence they came! Were you a woman, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">might yet be a glimmer of hope; but you are a man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And glad of it!" I thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aloud I turned the conversation again upon the flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You say that these vampire-plants came from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet Mars. How did that ever happen?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! It is suspected that they were deliberately</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought to this world during the last Martio-Tellurian</seg><seg type="columnLine">war, in 700,000 A.D., by the invading fiends from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red planet! Was ever a more hellish plot conceived?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knowing that our entire civilization, culture and prog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ress depended upon that most precious element, water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martians brought along young vampire-weeds from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their world and released them upon our own!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Considering the tremendous rate of growth which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants have--they develop from seed to maturity in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">course of a single day, a condition which was necessitated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their evolution by the extreme atmospheric changes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that take place upon their native planet--it is not to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">marveled at that in a comparatively short time our oceans</seg><seg type="columnLine">commenced to disappear, our atmosphere became dry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moistureless, and our fertile soil changed into an inhos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitable, hot red dust. In addition thousands of humans</seg><seg type="columnLine">and animals fell prey to the greedy tentacles of the flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">vampire-weed. Our nutritive vegetation withered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">died away in the dry soil and through lack of rainfall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Is it any wonder, then, that our mighty civilization, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">so proudly boasted of conquering the universe, collapsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and decayed before the rudimentary intelligence, or in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinct, of the vampire-plants?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not reply, for this topic of the downfall of man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become most distasteful to me, so we sat in silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a time. Then the old fellow asked suddenly, "Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">is this time machine of yours?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told him, and upon his request narrated the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">story of my voyage from 1930 A.D. to 1,001,930 A.D.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I had completed the tale, he suggested that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtain some much-wanted rest--a proposal to which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily acceded, being rather exhausted from my vicissi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tudes since my arrival in 1,001,930 A.D. Accordingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Last Man's gesture, I cast myself upon the broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">couch that was his bed, while he, extinguishing the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">by pressing a button in the wall, lay down beside me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The last thing I recall before I dropped off to sleep is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Last Man's voice reaching me out of the darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And tomorrow you will take me with you into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old fellow's persistence irritated me. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't he wait until morning, when I would be in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">better condition to think it over ? So rather tartly I an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I really don't see how I can do it! Frankly, it's im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Last Man said no more, and presently we fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep--at least, I did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALREADY the sun stood well up over the eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon when my lids slowly opened. I turned my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head to see whether the Last Man still slept but found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had apparently already risen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sitting up, I stretched and yawned and rubbed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumber out of my eyes. Then I rose to my feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked across the floor of the chamber to the doorway</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that opened to the corridor intending to inquire of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange host whether one might have water wherewith</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cleanse oneself and whether anything edible was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">had in the ancient city of Kur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But the old man was not to be seen in the corridor out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the chamber. So, turning to my right I sauntered</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the gallery to the rectangular entrance way, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">here glanced cautiously about in the vicinity of the struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. Nothing stirred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Casting my eyes toward the time machine, which rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the sand a hundred yards to my right, I beheld a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight that made my heart jump. Scattered on the desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the plane were a dozen or more great, torn, leaf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like things that I saw were exploded vampire-plants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while a number of others hovered in the air, surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the machine. Even as I looked, one of them burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a terrific noise, just as a toy balloon does when</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly pricked by a pin. I am quite sure now that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what caused the plant's explosion. It was the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. Under the growing heat of the sun's rays the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydrogen gas, so greatly expanded within the mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">braneous, globular bag that finally the thin skin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to resist the increasing gas pressure and broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">open. The bursting plants scatter afar the seeds or</seg><seg type="columnLine">spores, which take root in the soil and grow with in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credible speed during the daylight hours. When night</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes they break loose from the soil and float up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air--the huge, bloodthirsty monsters of my previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening's experience. The next morning the sunlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">bursts them again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet it was not this which riveted my attention. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight of the Last Man standing beside the time ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine, his revolver-like instrument glittering in his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door of the plane's cabin yawned open, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the looks of things he had been minutely inspecting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shouted at him and waved my arm, at the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking into a run toward him. He shot a hasty glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my direction; then in rapid succession five flashes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">red flame spat from his gun, and at each shot a hovering</seg><seg type="columnLine">vampire-plant vanished in a thunderous explosion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow fire. In a trice only a few flakes of blackened ash</seg><seg type="columnLine">were swirling through the air where previously had hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grim, flying plants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last of them had hardly disappeared when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Last Man ducked into the cabin of the plane, slamming</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door behind him. Before I guessed what he was up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to, the ship's propeller began to spin (I have a self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">starter in the craft so that the pilot can spin the propeller</seg><seg type="columnLine">by himself from within the cabin), and when I was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty yards distant it was roaring lustily. A moment later</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane commenced to roll off across the sands, gather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing momentum as she did so, and as I came to a halt with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dawning realization of the old scoundrel's purpose, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose gently off the ground and sped skyward in an east-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erly direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shout of horror, of despair leaped from my throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and an imperative call for him to halt, to return. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt whether he even heard me. A minute later, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinking heart, I watched the machine become a misty blur</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the blue skies overhead and vanish into Time! With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a low groan I slumped limply to the desert sands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried my face in my arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What a fate had overtaken me! Here I was ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooned in Time, in a distant age of the future, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of returning to my own era, stranded in a world</seg><seg type="columnLine">VIA THE TIME ACCELERATOR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">921</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of crumbling ruins, of fruitless earth, populated only by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weird vampire-plants from an alien planet and, worst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all--I was alone! Alone! That was what made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible blow doubly cruel. Had I had even a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion to share my miserable exile, the overwhelm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing despair that weighed me down would have been at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least slightly mitigated by the consolation of knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was another human being nearby, but to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">left thus alone--the only creature of my species upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet--was almost more than I could bear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wearily I raised my head, rose to my feet and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsteadily toward the crumbling city of Kur. I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know whither I was going, neither did I care. Bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-reproach filled my mind. I should have promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Last Man that I would return to the past with him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he would not have stolen the machine! What a fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had been in the first place even to think about time</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling! What a misguided ass I had been to start out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this accursed, hare-brained adventure! Why, oh, why</seg><seg type="columnLine">had I not obeyed the impulse to remain in my own time ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">But then--I had seen that time machine appear suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the sky, back in the year 1930, so it seemed that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to return. Yet--was I? Perhaps my eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had played me false; perhaps it was not my time machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all that I had seen, but an ordinary airplane emerging</seg><seg type="columnLine">from some wisp of mist that had at first rendered it so</seg><seg type="columnLine">indistinct! Or perhaps some scientist of my own age had</seg><seg type="columnLine">invented a device whereby to produce invisibility, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">attaching his machine to an airplane had rendered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft invisible. What I had taken to be my time machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">had probably really been this machine coming out of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of invisibility. Or possibly it had been my time</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine which I had seen, but with the Last Man at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls instead of me!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No matter which of these possibilities was the true one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact remained that my deplorable position was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowise remedied by this fruitless conjecture. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing for me to do in this sad situation was to make it as</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearable as I might.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Utterly crushed and despondent, I wandered long</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the empty, cracked stone avenues of Kur, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">footfalls ringing hollowly--mockingly--as I stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindly along my purposeless route.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus it was by pure accident that I meandered into an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense, tottering structure that reared ponderous and</seg><seg type="columnLine">imposing, majestic in all its decaying splendor, half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile or so from the spot where on the previous evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">my time machine had landed. From the various features</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were in evidence as I entered the enormous circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">lobby of the building, it was ostensibly some sort of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hibition palace or museum. Orderly rows of large glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases stretched away from the central lobby, covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gray dust of numberless millenniums and filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange and interesting relics of the Last Civilization.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To a small extent, these wonderful displays served to</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuage the despair that gripped me; but though I at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to interest myself in the strange, silent machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">that filled the glass cases of the nearest row, I was unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to discover anything of their purpose, since their con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction was beyond me and I could not read the odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">characters of the printed placards posted in the cases.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly I moved along the row of glass cases, many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were in a serious stage of disrepair, with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragments of glass and other debris littering the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">before them. Stirred up by my feet, the impalpable dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">of long-dead centuries rose in a thick, choking cloud,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">swirling lazily in the air and sinking down again to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor when I, who had so rudely interrupted its age-long</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace, had passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I came to the last great case in the row, not far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a rotting archway that opened upon a capacious</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone court, I checked my progress to stare first in mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentary interest, then in incredulous astonishment, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally in doubting puzzlement, at the single exhibit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">reposed within the glass-sided case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Could it really be--? No--no! That was impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible! Ridiculous! Absurd! But still-- Frowning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I glared at the thing in the box--silent, motionless, dust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered and braced with metal bands to prevent it from</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling apart--but despite my incredulity I saw that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was really what I thought it to be: there was my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">time machine! The very plane with which I had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this far-off age--the very machine that had spanned</seg><seg type="columnLine">a million years of time--the very machine with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Last Man had vanished into the Fourth Dimension</seg><seg type="columnLine">not more than an hour before!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So dumbfounded did the cognizance of this truth leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that I suddenly sat right down in the inch-thick dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">that carpeted the floor, blinking with unseeing eyes at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent machine in the case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How, in the name of all that was holy, did that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine get there? Through what queer freak of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it returned to 1,001,930 A.D. when I had seen it</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanish into thin air but an hour earlier? For five long</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes my very amazement kept me from grasping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious truth. But at last I saw light. Of course--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was how it worked!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the brown-skinned Last Man had clambered into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane that morning after familiarizing himself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its controls, he had flown back to the year 502,101 A.D.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as the history books written at that time had taught</seg><seg type="columnLine">him he would. There, evidently, he had ended his days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the time machine, for some reason or other, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed in this museum, to be found by its own builder</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a million years later!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course that elucidated the entire affair! But my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind whirled as it grappled with the new paradoxes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">attended this explanation. It meant that during the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceding night the same time machine had been in two dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent places simultaneously; at the one spot it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a new, spick-and-span condition while in the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, half a mile distant, it had been a machine so in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credibly ancient that only the metal bands around it</seg><seg type="columnLine">served to hold it together! This archaic machine had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been standing in this case for countless centuries. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the time that the Last Man had awaited my arrival</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the past, that he might appropriate my machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that very same instrument of escape from his eon had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been standing quietly in its case, only half a mile away!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had been waiting there before it arrived there, yet it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not have waited there if it had not arrived there</seg><seg type="columnLine">first! What would have occurred, I wondered, if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Last Man had returned to 502,101 A.D. with the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">that already stood there in that case? But he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done that, for then he would have been taking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time machine out of its location long before it arrived at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that location, and I, after arriving in 1,001,930, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have returned to 1930 with the original, new machine;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I could not have left it in 1,001,930 that it might go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to 502,101 A.D., where it could be put into a museum</seg><seg type="columnLine">case for the Last Man to find. My brain reeled groggily</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this tangle of contradicting facts and common sense.</seg><seg type="columnLine">922</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At length a doubt crept into my mind among my mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. Would this old, decrepit time machine, so long out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of use, operate?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I rose and kicked at the glass wall of the case, shatter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it into a thousand fragments. Then I stepped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case and carefully examined the plane and the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine. The first glance into the cabin assured me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was indeed my own machine, for engraved upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal-work within the cabin I found my own name and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the serial number I personally had put there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond a few necessary minor readjustments, nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared amiss with either plane or time machine, save</seg><seg type="columnLine">that both were fearfully dry and in need of oil. There-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, breaking out one entire wall of the exhibition case</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the machine might pass through, I rolled it out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case and upon the stone courtyard outside. Returning</seg><seg type="columnLine">then to the museum, I searched about for three long</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours until in hermetically sealed cans I found oil and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasoline, water, grease, and alcohol. These containers I</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened with the tools that I found still in their proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">place in the time machine. It took me nearly the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon to get the motor of the plane and the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine into working order, but at last the task was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done. Clambering into the cabin, I started the tvvo motors</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and was soon skimming across the stone courtyard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the museum, presently rising and spiraling upward into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue firmament.

Roy Hopkins</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT the September meeting of the Shelby County</seg><seg type="columnLine">Psychiatric Association I gave a preliminary</seg><seg type="columnLine">report of a case which I believe to be unique in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">annals of modern psychiatry. As that report was made</seg><seg type="columnLine">over eight months ago, I wish to present here a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">detailed account of the case, with its recent develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, and for the benefit of those of you who were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in attendance at that meeting or may have forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the details, I will consider the case from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the patient was admitted to the Psychopathic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hospital.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> History: H. V. P., a native born American of Dutch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and English ancestry, age 46. unmarried, white male,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was admitted to the receiving ward of the Psychopathic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hospital, July 28, 1941. He was committed to this in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitution by Judge Lynch, of the Sixth Judicial District,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the jury had found him insane when on trial for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of homicides of negroes. He came from a first</seg><seg type="columnLine">family, his early life was normal, with the exception</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a rather violent temper. In his youth he took up</seg><seg type="columnLine">art and was rapidly on the road to fame when an acci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent deprived him of his right arm. He fortunately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or it may have been unfortunate, retained the late Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evans, who performed upon him the world's first arm-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grafting operation. It may be well to note here that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arm was taken from a condemned negro criminal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a few years the patient was painting more marvelous</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures than ever, but some of them bordered on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fantastic. At this time his friends began to notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his conduct was slowly being altered. He dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged the negro valet who had been his faithful ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vant since childhood. He would cross the street to</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid passing a negro, and even at the mention of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could be noticed that his face grew tense and sullen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">About this time he had a series of engagements with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some very charming young ladies, but each one was</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly terminated. After this he was seldom seen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">society and his paintings grew more grotesque than ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was during this period that he started going out</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the night, and on several occasions he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to have stayed away from home for as many</seg><seg type="columnLine">as three days at a time and to have returned at the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that period with his clothes mud-spattered and torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in an altogether disreputable state. His man also</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that these events corresponded with a series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of brutal murders. It was after one such event, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the master returned with blood on his clothes, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new valet made his report to the chief of police. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">artist being questioned, readily admitted his guilt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made such statements before the jury as caused them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to render the unanimous verdict of insanity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the patient was first seen he was nervous and</seg><seg type="columnLine">irritable and had a habit of opening and clenching his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand, which was gloved. He appeared poorly</seg><seg type="columnLine">nourished and his face conveyed the impression of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was constantly besieged by hallucinations. Other</seg><seg type="columnLine">than this he seemed to be an average man. His clinical</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture presented nothing of interest and will not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussed here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the negro porter brought him his baggage</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was another near homicide committed, and but for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the immediate intervention of several white attendants</seg><seg type="columnLine">the assault would probably have terminated fatally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His condition grew rapidly worse and the hallucina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions increased in distinctness and duration, frequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurring in the day time. One of his commonest fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cies was that he was being pursued by a negro, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempting to cut off his arm. This type of aberration</seg><seg type="columnLine">is very typical of his kind of insanity. He grew more</seg><seg type="columnLine">morose and solitary and under no conditions would he</seg><seg type="columnLine">permit an attendant to remove his glove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In view of the preceding facts, a diagnosis of para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noia was made, and at this time it was suggested that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right arm again be amputated, this time above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">region of the graft. However, before this was accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plished he was found dead in his cell, having bled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death from a self-inflicted wound which had severed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right radial artery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Summary: A patient with a negative psychiatric his-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory became criminally insane following a graft of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">negro's arm, although the operation was a physical and</seg><seg type="columnLine">physiological success. From this we may conclude that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is advisable for a surgeon to consider the mental, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as physical, aspects of any such similar operation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The End.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Drums of Tapajos</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By Capt.

They arrive in due time in the outskirts of the tierra</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">frohibitiva, where they find it almost impossible to get enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">radians to go with them. They finally do get, because of the men's</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendship with the master, the services of Pedro, who had gone more</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply into the wilderness than any of the other natives, and returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">--though not to tell of it. More Indians were willing to go with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pedro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nankivell, during this trip, saves the life of Pedro from a water</seg><seg type="columnLine">reptile. In return, Pedro forfeits his life by telling the men his</seg><seg type="columnLine">story of the interior, in an effort to make these men give up this</seg><seg type="columnLine">m&lt;jd adventure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They continue, however, and soon enter the Unknown Gateway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its corresponding dangers of flying arrows and jungle terrors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By this time they have learned the truth of much of Pedro's story.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the most dangerous signal is the sound that later becomes known</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them as "the drums of Tapajos," for this generally heralds at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least one death. They have lost all but Pedro and two other Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all the men they started out with. When they get off the boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">and start afoot, they learn that the poisoned arrow shots that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken toll of some of their Indians are now used for the purpose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">guiding the travelers. Following the directions of the arrows, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon come to an enormous door, which opens quietly while they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering what to do, and Nahum, the Warder of the Outer Gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Crypt, appears. The five strangers follow Nahum through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gate and are made comfortable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a sumptuous repast and a rest, the 'Visitors" are taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the Master and the Council for examination as to their re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liability and fitness for remaining among these strange people. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">come through the examination with flying colors and are taken to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city of Troyana, where they meet Nahum's granddaughter, Estha,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his nieces Balkis and Adah. The adventurers are initiated into</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the wonders and secrets of the government with one exception--</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crypt remained a secret even to the highest among them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the guardians of the Crypt knew about it. Our travelers are</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted a view of the "Guardian of the Jungle," a saurian, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Pedro, they soon learn of an incipient revolution. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the groat ceremony of the year--the Adoration of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Golden Calf, that the excitement starts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Part III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Adoration of the Golden Calf</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was a great relief to leave that place of horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to return again to the beautiful regions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue city. The luxury and high degree of</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization that existed there formed a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrast to the barbarism and state of near-slavery</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we had just witnessed. I expressed as much to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nahum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Brother Duncan," he replied, "I can appreciate your</seg><seg type="columnLine">feelings very fully, for at times I have felt as you now</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel. It is, even now, a matter of great grief to me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to most of the brethren of the blue degree that such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of affairs must exist. Many attempts have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">made in the past to alleviate the condition of the Bearers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of Burdens, but they have been abortive. As a race,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they do not have the adaptability, mental capacity, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">moral integrity that is essential to the preservation'of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high degree of civilization.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the past they have been allowed to increase their</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers and to live in a state of independence much</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater than they now enjoy, but each time that this is</seg><seg type="columnLine">done they have tried to presume upon their privileges</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they were able to enjoy them and twice in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">history they have threatened the entire downfall of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization and the loss of our entire store of accumu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated knowledge.

Tonight at the ceremony you may get</seg><seg type="columnLine">some insight into their degradation and blood-thirstiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">which may tend to somewhat alter your present natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of sympathy for them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We reentered the garden by the door through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had quitted it, but there was no one to meet us. Nan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kivell looked disappointed and Nahum smiled broadly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Brother Nankivell," he said, "Estha asked me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tender her regrets that she will not be able to be at</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper with us tonight, but she is busy with preparations</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the evening's ceremony in which she plays a leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">part.

They were solid blue in color</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were heavy with silver embroidery, depicting many</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar emblems, together with some which we did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognize.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pistols, Bob?" asked Willis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hardly think so," said Willis.

Unfortunately they</seg><seg type="columnLine">can give but one discharge and then they are useless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hence we carry many of them. Some day soon I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">borrow one of your pistols and have our mechanics copy</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Meanwhile, I would advise you to return and arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourselves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He explained further when we returned armed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It has been over a thousand years since internal dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sension has threatened Troyana," he said, "but if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever comes again, it will come on this particular night in</seg><seg type="columnLine">preference to all others. On this night all of the Burden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bearers are assembled together with only a portion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Craftsmen and Planners. The black robes will out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">number the higher degrees by more than five to one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequently we always go armed. If the Burden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bearers were to try to revolt, ordinarily we could subdue</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in a few minutes by shutting off the air compres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sors and consequently their ventilation, but tonight they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be gathered in the room with us and this method</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be applicable. This is the one great holiday</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the year for them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If trouble developed, would Miss Estha be in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger?" asked Nankivell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I think not," replied Nahum, "but even if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, there is nothing that I could do. She is the High</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priestess of the Calf and she takes the central part in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceremony of the Adoration. I also have a part in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceremony which will prevent me from being with you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I will put you in charge of some one who will ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain it to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We entered the underground auditorium and I paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">in amazement at the size of it. One end was taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">up by a broad stage before which hung a golden curtain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the floor, directly before the curtain, was a section</seg><seg type="columnLine">of seats capable of holding about three thousand persons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as I could judge. This was already filled when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we came in with men and women attired in yellow robes</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked with white embroidery. On each side of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">section, arranged somewhat like the boxes in a theatre,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a smaller section in which were seated wearers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue. A railing divided these sections from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance of the room which constituted the main area.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would seat at least twenty-five thousand persons, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am sure. Tier on tier, the seats rose until they seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">endless and it was solidly filled with men, women and</seg><seg type="columnLine">children attired in severely plain black robes. Between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black section and the sections where sat the higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">degrees, stood a line of guards, some Indian and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">Craftsmen, officered by blue-clad Planners. A colorful</seg><seg type="columnLine">splash of color was made by a group of about fifty per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons, nearly all women and children, who wore robes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a brilliant crimson, heavily embroidered with gold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE whole assembly was strangely silent. While</seg><seg type="columnLine">those near us sat in more or less relaxed attitudes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tension that pervaded the black section could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly felt. It was evident in the strained attitudes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thousands of intently gazing eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nahum led us to seats in the blue section and left us</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment, returning with the Planner whom we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had met in the generator room that afternoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Brother Habbakuk has no part in the ceremonies</seg><seg type="columnLine">that follow," he said, "and I have asked him to sit here</seg><seg type="columnLine">by you and translate for your benefit, as the ceremonies</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">will be in Hebrew and Atlantean, with neither of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are conversant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Habbakuk greeted us courteously and Nahum de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted for the regions behind the golden curtain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you armed?" was his first question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We assured him that we were and he smiled in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather shamefaced manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the first time that I have worn the blue at</seg><seg type="columnLine">an Adoration and I am, perhaps, unduly nervous," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "At any rate, it will do you no harm to learn what</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do should anything happen. Do you see that door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the left of the curtain? That leads into a corri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dor on each side of which are elevators that lead into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sanctuary. They are of large capacity and are so</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged that raising one car automatically lowers an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. If you should have to take to them, enter with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out fear, close the door and ascend at full speed. Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">action in leaving will, in itself, open another car for</seg><seg type="columnLine">more persons. Now I will tell you something of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are to see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he paused, a deep sonorous voice sounded from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air before us and he hastily motioned us to silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I looked around for the source of the voice but could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, for a moment, find it. I looked inquiringly at Hab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bakuk who pointed toward the stage. Before the cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain stood Zephaniah, his arms outspread and his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised, speaking. He could not have been speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">loudly but his voice seemed to fill the air and to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all directions at once. It was evident that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of a microphonic transmitter before him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was amplifying his voice so that it filled the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">ampitheater.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The opening prayer to the God of Fire, whose son</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Calf is," whispered Habbakuk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The effect of the rich sonorous voice rolling out its</seg><seg type="columnLine">majectic Hebraic periods in the otherwise deathly silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">was impressive to the highest degree. As Zephaniah</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked the lights grew gradually dim and my attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">was drawn to a brilliant point of light above his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">which seemed to grow brighter and more intense and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">expand until its radiance filled the whole amphitheater.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His voice rolled on and on and it seemed to me that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was floating in the air and I was filled with a nameless</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of ecstasy. Larger and larger grew the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it seemed to be pervading my entire being and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated on waves of majestic sound, buoyed up with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">radiance of light. Lighter and lighter I grew-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Habbakuk pinched me sharply and I came to earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a crash. He gave the same treatment to Mariston</seg><seg type="columnLine">and motioned me to arouse Willis and Nankivell. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them had his eyes focussed on the point of light above</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zephaniah's head and an expression of rapture was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell's face. Willis was grinning like a satyr. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinched each of them sharply and they shook their heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked around. Nankivell started to speak but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">motioned him to silence and looked at Habbakuk. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at the light and then looked meaningly away. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood his motion and seized Nankivell by the ear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forcibly turned his head away. For perhaps five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes longer Zephaniah's voice rolled on and then died</seg><seg type="columnLine">away into quiet. Habbakuk shook his head sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hypnotism," he whispered. "I forgot to tell you not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look at the light."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Zephaniah's voice died away I ventured to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">again at the light and saw that it was coming through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden curtain. For a moment there was silence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a sweet wailing as of wood-winds and stringed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DRUMS OF TAPAJOS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">927</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">struments pervaded the air. Louder and louder it grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a note of barbarous sensuality crept into it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtain shivered slightly and I saw that it was slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissolving into nothingness before my gaze and an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct image was-gradually taking form behind it. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was from a point on this image that the single light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which now illuminated the entire building, shone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More and more transparent grew the curtain and pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently it disappeared and the image stood plain before us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was that of a calf, monstrous and satanic, eight or</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine feet high at the shoulder and constructed apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">of massive gold. Strings of sparkling gems surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">its misshapen neck and the eyes were huge red stones</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing with an internal fire of their own. From a spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the forehead emanated the intensely brilliant light</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had shone through the curtain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air of sensuality pervading the music became</seg><seg type="columnLine">more pronounced and a slight stir went through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">audience. The music rose to a crescendo of barbaric</seg><seg type="columnLine">passion and before the image appeared a figure, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently materializing from thin air. I gasped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked again. From the corner of my eye, I saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell was shaking his head and rubbing his eyes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dazed manner. No wonder--for the figure before us</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that of Estha; but not the Estha we thought we</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew. Gone was the girlishness and graceful dignity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her bearing and gone were the graceful robes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we had seen her. Her long black hair was</seg><seg type="columnLine">powdered with gold and hung free from a fillet, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkled and scintillated with the fire of a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">gems. Showers of glittering points of light, which could</seg><seg type="columnLine">only have been diamonds, hung pendant from each side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fillet flowing over her perfectly molded shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">and caught in a bunch before her. For the rest, she wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">a girdle of jewels over her hips from which depended</seg><seg type="columnLine">strings of gems half way to her feet and jeweled anklets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nankivell whistled softly between his teeth as he gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the vision of loveliness before him and I didn't blame</seg><seg type="columnLine">him much. I had realized that Estha was a beautiful girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a superb specimen of womanhood, but I had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">before realized the absolute perfection of her proportions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment she poised there and then as the music</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew more sensuous and languorous, she danced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Softly at first she began but more and more fire crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">into her movements until she seemed a wreathing mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of points of fire and represented the very spirit of pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. Faster and higher the notes of the music rose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping pace with the fury of the dance. Suddenly it</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped on a discordant note that crashed out, out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmony with the rest of it, and we came to with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">start. Then began the strains of a bacchanale which</seg><seg type="columnLine">could well have been played in the temples of Ashtoreth</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the height of the infamy of Babylon, that harlot</seg><seg type="columnLine">among cities. From the darkness beside Estha material-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized other shapes, clad in diaphanous draperies. Among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the group of girls I recognized both Adah and Balkis</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I heard Mariston's breath hiss out sharply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They joined Estha in a mad riot of motion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">surpassed anything that I had seen, even in dreams.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Faster and more furious grew the dance and then again</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a discordant crash and the dancers froze into im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobility on their knees, their arms upstretched in sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plication to the horrible image above them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE music started again but this time the strains</seg><seg type="columnLine">held a note of cruelty and blood-thirstiness. Slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dancers moved aside leaving Estha alone before the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">image and slowly, as though fascinated, she approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and mounted the steps of the pedestal on which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood. As she advanced with a langorous and feline</seg><seg type="columnLine">grace that seemed to suggest blood and torture, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she held in her hand a naked dagger whose blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistened in the light. Nahum came slowly into view</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the image of the calf and in his hands he held a</seg><seg type="columnLine">naked infant. Forward Estha glided, her entire attitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestive of cruelty and a desire for blood. Nahum</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed her the child and she took it in her arms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised it ceremonfously before the image and then low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered it again. Three times she raised and lowered it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed to me that that accursed image nodded. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">this happened, Estha laid the child on the platform be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the monster and raising her knife, she brought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" exclaimed Mariston hoarsely and strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled to his feet, drawing his automatic as he did so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Down! Sit down!" exclaimed Habbakuk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nankivell was also on his feet and I must have risen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although I have no recollection of moving, for I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself standing with drawn pistol when Iiabbakuk</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook me. I glanced down at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's not a child, it's a dummy!" he muttered hoarsely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What ?" I asked in a dazed manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a dummy! Don't let that fool fire!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I grasped Nankivell by the arms and dragged him for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cibly into his seat, while Habbakuk did the same to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mariston. Nankivell tried to struggle but I twisted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun from his grasp and turned my attention to Willis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was too late. I struck his arm up just as his gun went</seg><seg type="columnLine">off with an ear-shattering roar and his bullet struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">image. With the sound of the gun a haze seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear from my eyes and I saw plainly that what I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought was a human child was merely a bundle of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">inert material wrapped in white. I saw Mariston rub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound of the shot was followed by silence for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment and then a voice arose from the black section.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It rose alone, frightfully distinct in the profound hush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then arose a roar. I had never heard it before but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it for the blood cry of an angry mob. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black section came a wave of humanity rolling toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. The line of yellow-clad guards sprang forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">brandishing tubes such as I had seen hung to Nahum's</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt, but the mob was beyond fear. Forward they</seg><seg type="columnLine">surged, sweeping over the thin line of Cowans and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Craftsmen and then came a blinding flash and the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">was filled with the flash and crash of high tension elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trical discharges.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By dozens and by hundreds the oncoming Burden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bearers fell before the flash of guns of the Craftsmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Planners, but where one fell, a dozen took his</seg><seg type="columnLine">place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the sanctuary!" shouted Habbakuk in my ear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned toward the door he had pointed out earlier in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening. I turned to follow, but Nankivell was no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">by my side. I turned to look for him and saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a dozen tier of seats below me fighting his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the stage, Mariston at his heels. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing else to do, so I took out after him as fast as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't shoot, Dune," shouted Willis in my ear, "we</seg><seg type="columnLine">may need every round for close quarters."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Frank," I shouted as I reached him, "you're headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wrong way! Come back!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook himself free from my restraining hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">928</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed toward the stage as he fought his way forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Estha!" he shouted back over his shoulder, "she is</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut off! We've got to get to her!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked at the stage and saw the cause of his per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbation. Estha stood alone before the image and al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready the oncoming black wave was between her and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of retreat. Forward we made our way, blinded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the flashes and deafened by the roar of the electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">discharges. We reached the stage, but to our dismay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was ten feet above our heads and the smooth polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface offered no handhold. We were stopped for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment but Mariston sprang forward and put his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up with you, Frank!" he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nankivell ran forward and stepped in Mariston's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupped hands. Mariston gave a tremendous upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">heave and Nankivell jumped and between their efforts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rose high enough to get a grip on the stage above him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hastily put my shoulder under his foot and in a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment he was lost to view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Catch hold of me, Dune, Ray next," said Mariston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stepped beside him and between us we hoisted Willis</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the stage. In a moment he was on his stomach lean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over to grasp my hand and I joined him. I dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">prone beside him and we caught Mariston's hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoisted him just in time td escape having his ankles</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped by the first of our pursuers. We dragged him</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and I arose and looked around. The stage was empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is Frank?" I cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This way," cried Mariston, "I saw him go behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I followed him, but Willis was an old fighter and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed behind for a moment, long enough to shoot the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first two of our pursuers who gained the platform, thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving us a moment of respite. Mariston and I rounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the platform on which the image stood and before us</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw an open doorway. Into the darkness we plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed closely by Willis. As we did so, a flash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">orange light stabbed the darkness and a bullet whistled</seg><seg type="columnLine">past my ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Frank!" cried Mariston as I was about to return the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bob!" came a welcome answering voice and in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment we were beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are we?" asked Willis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," he replied. "Just as I gained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform, I saw a figure that I am sure was Estha dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear behind the idol and I followed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dune, you know how to shut that door, don't you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Willis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think so," I answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then shut it and keep those hellhounds out," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you a match?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mariston lighted one and I hastily looked for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the concealed emergency levers which Nahum had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown me that morning. Fortunately I found it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door rose with a crash just in front of our pursuers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving us in total darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now what?" asked Mariston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go ahead," said Nankivell eagerly, "Estha went this</seg><seg type="columnLine">way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If she did, she's probably safe in the sanctuary by</seg><seg type="columnLine">now," I replied. "She knows the roads here. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have thought of that and made our own escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">while we could. She probably stood there as a decoy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to draw the attack and enable the rest of us to get into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the elevators while she had her own way of escape open</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's probably true," said Mariston, "but all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same, I don't blame Frank at all. If it had been Balkis</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of Estha, I expect that I would have led the way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The question now is, which way shall we go ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's only one way," replied Willis, "and that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight ahead. We can't go back and one way forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">is as good as another. It will be just a matter of luck</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we land anyway, my sense of direction is no good</seg><seg type="columnLine">underground."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The truth of his statement was too self-evident to</seg><seg type="columnLine">merit discussion and we assented to his program.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let Nankivell lead the way," directed Willis. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">might possibly hit something ahead of him but after</seg><seg type="columnLine">that shot he made when we entered I don't care to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">him behind me if any shooting starts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Righto, old top," laughed Nankivell. "Still, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">had better be glad that I can't shoot. If I could, our.</seg><seg type="columnLine">number would be one less right now. Come on, boys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward march, and devil take the hindmost."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With pistols drawn and ready, we followed him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Pedro Pays His Debt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I HAVE no very clear idea as to the distance that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked before we encountered an obstacle. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not have been very far, but in the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and absolute quiet through which we moved, it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">interminable. My nerves were getting more jumpy every</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute, and I expect that I sprang three feet when</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a crash before us followed by Nankivell's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised in a howl of pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"What is it, Frank?" asked Mariston anxiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"---!" exclaimed Nankivell luridly. "I've</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">come to the end of this benighted passage and I ram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">med my head into a stone wall."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, is that all ?" replied Mariston in a relieved voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I thought it was something serious."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's serious enough to suit me," retorted Nankivell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Have you any more matches?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I used the only one I had when Dune closed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door," he replied. "Who has some?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have two," I said after I had searched the pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my pistol belt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only two?" cried Willis, "hasn't any one else any?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A silence answered his query.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll have to save them then," he remarked. "Dune,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know more about these doors than the rest of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">do, see if you can find the button."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I searched by the sense of touch unavailingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll have to use one of our matches then," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willis when I reported my inability to find the lever in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness. "Bob, you light it and let Dune stand by</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get the best advantage from it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The light flared up and I searched frantically for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sign of a lever which would open the way before</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. Not a thing could I find and the match flared up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It may be a door that will open only at a vocal com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand," I ventured, "Nahum told me that there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">some without emergency levers at places where Burden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bearers were commonly employed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"This may be one of them," assented Willis. "Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DRUMS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF TAPAJOS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">929</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the best thing for us to do, so far as I can see, is to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back the way we came. We had better separate and go</seg><seg type="columnLine">two to a side. In that way we may find an intersecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage that will lead us somewhere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How far is it back to where we entered?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mariston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a moment of silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Darned if I know, Bob," said Willis at length. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to have known enough to keep track of the num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of steps, but I forgot it. At any rate we know one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, it is straight behind us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I doubt that," I replied. "In this darkness, there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">little chance that we wouldn't swing off to one side. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather think that we will find that the passage has curved</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the left."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All the more reason for keeping in touch with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls," he said. "You come with me, Frank, and let</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dune go with Bob."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we started back I took the lead, my hand on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall beside me and carefully counting my footsteps. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone one hundred and ninety-seven before the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly ended. Simultaneously Willis spoke and an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced a similar discovery from the other wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Evidently we have hit a right-angle intersecting pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage," he said. "The question now is, which way shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">we go?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think that Nahum's house lies to our left," I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My sense of direction is no good underground in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark," he replied. "Even if you are right, I don't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">we want to go back there. Judging from such of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrap as I saw, Nahum and his friends are either in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanctuary or they have gone west. The place we want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find is the sanctuary and that should be almost di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly above us. Let's take the left for our way at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture until we hit another passage or a door. We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">split and go each side and keep track of our steps as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been doing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We changed direction and continued on our way. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone two hundred and sixty-two paces when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stopped by a stone wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the devil ?" exclaimed Mariston, "what do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">make of this, Ray?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no answer. He called again and still no</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer came to us. We turned and retraced our steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">but we found no intersecting passage. Again we called</seg><seg type="columnLine">but only silence answered us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must have turned off on a diverging passage,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Mariston. "These darned sandals don't make</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough sound on a rubber pavement to be heard a foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Take the left wall, Dune, and I'll take the right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but speak every five paces so we won't get separated."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this manner we started but after fifty paces we</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that our voices were suddenly muffled and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped and investigated. Sure enough, the corridor</seg><seg type="columnLine">branched off into two directions at a small angle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damn!" exclaimed Mariston. "Come over to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and take the left side of the corridor I am on. You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently on the one we followed before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again we resumed our advance but within eighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">paces the passage branched again. We stopped in dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">may.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ray! Frank!" shouted Mariston, throwing caution</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the winds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE strained our ears and it seemed that we caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">a faint reply. Mariston called again and this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were sure that we heard an answer, but it seemed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to come from behind us. We turned and retraced our</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps, halloing from time to time. The answers drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer for a time and then started to grow fainter and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes came from behind us again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Either we are completely turned around or else we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are in a perfect maze," said Mariston. "Turn around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dune, we might as well try to follow the sound."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We shouted again and an answer came faintly to us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We strove to follow it but it rapidly grew fainter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"The only thing for us to do is to stand still and shout,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob," I suggested. "They are moving as well as we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that is probably why we are missing each other."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're probably right," he replied. "We'll stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">right here and shout at intervals."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We did so and to our relief the answering voices came</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer. Once or twice they started to get fainter but</seg><seg type="columnLine">their average distance was steadily lessened and suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">they sounded almost at our sides. In a few moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willis and Nankivell joined us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now where?" Mariston asked after we had com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared notes and found that the experiences of Willis and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell had been identical with ours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Frankly, I haven't an idea," replied Willis. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fair idea of about where we were when we started,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I am completely lost now. We may be moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight back toward the ampitheater. For all that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, it may be just around the next corner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> None of us had any idea of our location so we set for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward at random, two on each side as before, but keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">vocal contact. It was well that we did so for in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments it became evident that we were in a perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">maze of passages and might very easily be going in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle. For over an hour we kept up our round of</seg><seg type="columnLine">marching and paused at last when we ran into a door</seg><seg type="columnLine">marking the end of the passage we had been following.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To say that we were tired would be putting it very</seg><seg type="columnLine">mildly. When a person has been used to walking with</seg><seg type="columnLine">heeled boots all of his life, heelless sandals, even on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubber flooring, will wear him out in a short time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be damned if I know what to do, Bob," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willis despondently, "I was never more thoroughly lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my life. Good Lord, look at that! Back! Back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw pistols!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That" was a narrow line of light on the roof before</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. As we watched, the crack grew wider and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent that the door ahead of us was slowly lowering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down it slipped until it had opened a space of about two</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and then the motion ceased. We watched it without</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving for a minute and then Nankivell stole silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. The rest of us followed at his heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We reached the door, the top of which was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">three feet above our heads and paused, listening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A murmur of voices came from the other side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrier. Something about one of the voices seemed quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar and we strained our ears. Suddenly Nankivell</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a shout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pedro!" he called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Seiior Frank!" came the answer from the other side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the door in what was quite evidently Pedro's voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Open the door, Pedro," called Willis. "We are</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Senor Ray," said Pedro, "it will not open more. Can</seg><seg type="columnLine">you get over it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Easy," said Nankivell, "get your back to it, Bob."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wait a minute, Frank," interposed Willis, "this may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a trap."</seg><seg type="columnLine">930</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Trap, nothing!" cried Nankivell, "I'd trust Pedro</seg><seg type="columnLine">anywhere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So would I, but it is possible that he is a prisoner and</seg><seg type="columnLine">is speaking under duress," objected Willis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not Pedro," replied Nankivell. "At any rate, I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as soon be bumped off in a hurry as starve to death</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this damned dungeon. I'm going over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mariston placed his back to the wall and, aided by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of us, Frank scrambled up upon the door, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">like most of the Troyana doors, proved to be about eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet thick. He crawled forward and looked over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther edge and then crawled back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, fellows," he said, "it's Pedro all right and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie's alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few moments we were beside him and together</seg><seg type="columnLine">we crawled to the far edge and dropped down. Pedro</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell on his knees and tried to kiss Nankivell's hand, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell forstalled him and insisted on shaking hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Pedro's embarrassment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How on earth did you find us ?" Mariston asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Seiior Bob, although you did not see me, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the guards in the big room when the great ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gician prayed. I had seen medicine men work before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I shut my eyes and my ears and he had no power over</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Then I saw the white Goddess dance and pretend</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was making a sacrifice. Then I heard Seiior</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ray's gun and then all fought and I tried to join you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw you climb up on the place w'here the God was and</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow the white Goddess, but I could not get up there</seg><seg type="columnLine">without aid and I was swept away by the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The black robes do not hate us of the Indian tribes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and none offered to do me harm. Besides, they know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we all carry poisoned knives, and it may be that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they avoid us because they wish to live and not because</seg><seg type="columnLine">they love us. When you shut the door in their faces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who were pursuing you came back and said that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were in the labyrinth and could never escape and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they would hunt you down at their leisure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When I heard these words, I took one of the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">robes who seemed to know that of which he spoke and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I drew him to one side and pressed the point of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">poisoned knife against him and bade him to follow me</seg><seg type="columnLine">without crying out. When we were away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd, I asked him of another entrance. He said that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was none and I told him that then he must die.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, since he saw that I meant what I had said, he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered another way into the labyrinth and he led</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to this door and told me that you were somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the far side of it. He did not know how to open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, so I took him away a distance and killed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When I had cleaned my knife, I went back to the hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brought with me another black robe to this spot. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew how to open the door and he tried to do so, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would open only a short distance. He said that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great ones above had so fixed it and that none of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black robes could do more than he had done. So I took</seg><seg type="columnLine">him away a distance and killed him and then came back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking how I could get over it. I prayed to the Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spirit and to the God of this place in the voice that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">bidden for each. When neither answered, I made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful medicine and prayed to each of the Gods in</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn, one phrase to each, and each in a different voice so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they would think that each was being supplicated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of his worshipers and aid one another. My prayer</seg><seg type="columnLine">was answered, for while I was praying I heard your</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. Since the Gods had answered my prayer, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanked them and spoke to you. That is all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's enough!" cried Nankivell. "That is more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any one of us could have done. You are a real</seg><seg type="columnLine">hero, Pedro. Now where shall we go? Do you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road to the sanctuary?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Seiior Frank, but I know the road to the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings where the Indians sleep. There my countrymen are</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there not even the black robes would dare to try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess we had better go there and work from there</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a base," said Mariston. "I hope we don't meet any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them on the way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have an idea," exclaimed Willis. "Pedro, where are</seg><seg type="columnLine">those two bodies?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But a short distance away, Seiior Ray."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine," he replied. "You fellows wait here. Pedro,</seg><seg type="columnLine">come with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were gone for perhaps ten minutes and returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with four black robes and sandals to match.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put these on," directed Willis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where did you get four ?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't ask questions," he retorted. "Pedro still had</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knife and I had my strength and it was their lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">or ours. Get them on and let's go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We made short work of doffing our ceremonial blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">robes and donning the black ones and, attired as four</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burden Bearers and one Cowan, we set forth under</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pedro's guidance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR perhaps half a mile we pursued our way through</seg><seg type="columnLine">tortuous corridors, meeting only a few doors which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened without trouble. We met no one and we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to breathe easier, when a sound reached our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears that stopped us in our tracks. It was the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices speaking in Atlantean and they were approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a corridor that intersected the one we were in, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few yards ahead. We turned to retreat but there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross passage and no door for several hundreds of yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our rear and the voices were apparently only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards from the intersection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we hesitated with drawn pistols, a body of ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in black robes came into sight bringing with them a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner. We were not seen for a moment and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">their leader looked toward us. He called something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us in Atlantean and I responded in a gibberish which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped would deceive him. It might have done so had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not his glance fallen on Nankivell's blond head. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost the same instant Mariston recognized the prisoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shouted his name aloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Zephaniah!" he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a word from the leader two of the band hurled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged Master to the floor and pinioned him while the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced toward us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let them come close enough that you won't waste a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot and then turn loose," said Willis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We obeyed his instructions and let the advancing men</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach to within ten yards before we opened fire. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sheer murder, shooting down those unarmed men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there was no time to hesitate and I downed my two</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a qualm of conscience. As the last of the eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell, we ran forward to release the Master.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nankivell and Pedro w'ere somewhat in advance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had almost reached him, when I saw something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made my blood run cold. One of his captors was</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding an electric pistol in bis hand and was squinting</seg><seg type="columnLine">along it toward Nankivell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look out, Frank!" I shouted, but I was too late.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a blinding flash and an ear-splitting roar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DRUMS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF TAPAJOS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">931</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment we were blinded. As my eyes cleared I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the sharp crack of an automatic and saw Nankivell</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing unharmed with a smoking pistol in his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again the pistol spoke and the second of Zephaniah's</seg><seg type="columnLine">captors dropped. Frank dropped his pistol and bent for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward over something on the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had called to him quickly, but I had been too slow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not so Pedro, however. He had seen Nankivell's peril</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as I had and where I had paused to warn him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pedro had acted to save him. He had thrown himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and had taken the charge of static electricity</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his own body and had saved his friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His whole left arm and shoulder were burned away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This alone had not been enough to absorb the charge, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had deflected it and it had spent its energy on the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. Sadly we looked at the shattered remains of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">faithful friend and guide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A faithful servant, brethren," said a deep sonorous</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice at our sides and we saw Zephaniah had risen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Faithful unto death. For such as he, there is a greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">reward laid up than for us who wear the blue, no matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">how worthily. Brethren, let us kneel and ask that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Architect make his example to so ennoble us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to raise in our bosoms such thoughts as will enable us</seg><seg type="columnLine">better to aid our fellow men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In silence we knelt and the solemn voice of the Master</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled out the stately periods and sounding phrases of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oldest prayer in the world. I have heard many</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayers in my life; I have heard a solemn requiem mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the soul of a departed Pope; I have heard a nation</seg><seg type="columnLine">weep for a martyred President; but never has a prayer</seg><seg type="columnLine">so moved me as that simple yet solemn prayer offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight hundred feet underground for the sake of a poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage who had given his all for the master whom he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made his friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he had finished the prayer, Zephaniah remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his knees for a few moments in silence and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My brethren," he said, "thanks to your timely aid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am still spared to labor for my people. Others may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be attracted by the sound of your weapons, so it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooves us to hasten to the sanctuary. We will take with</seg><seg type="columnLine">us the body of your servant in order that it may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposed of with fitting ceremonies. Let us pass on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nankivell and I raised Pedro's body and soberly fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed the Master, Nankivell's shoulders shaking with</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppressed sobs as he walked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Sanctuary</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE retraced our steps for perhaps a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards and then Zephaniah paused and facing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his left, spoke a few words. Before us a door</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid slowly down, displaying to our gaze the familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows of seats that were characteristic of the conveyances</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Troyana. We entered and seated ourselves, laying</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pedro's body respectfully on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How far are we from the sanctuary?" asked Maris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are close to the outer edge of the city," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zephaniah. "Unfortunately we cannot return by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most direct route for that leads through the amphitheater</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is held by the Burden Bearers. We will have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to a point beyond our destination and double back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">We changed conveyances four times before we entered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one which bore us swiftly upward as was shown by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure on our feet. Presently the elevator stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we were confronted by a row of Craftsmen, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised electric pistols in a threatening manner, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the color of Zephaniah's robe became evident to them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was recognized. With a cry of joy, a Planner</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was evidently in command of the detachment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards, hastened forward to greet him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is all well, Tubal?" asked the Master.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All is well, Most Worshipful Sir," replied the Plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner. "Many of our rank have perished, but many have</seg><seg type="columnLine">also gained the Sanctuary and are safe.

He called out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Hebrew and, when a Cowan answered, he gave an</seg><seg type="columnLine">order. The Indian bowed and went out, to return in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes with a pitcher of wine and five goblets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zephaniah gulped his eagerly and the rest of us were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">more reluctant. Zephaniah spoke to the Cowan again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a few minutes two Indians entered and raised Pedro's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body and reverently bore it out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My brethren," said Zephaniah kindly, "you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtless seen much that puzzles you.

"We seemed to see Estha prepare to sacrifice a</seg><seg type="columnLine">human child before that hideous monstrosity and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">later we saw that it was only a dummy and then trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">started. What did it all mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zephaniah smiled slightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doubtless you fixed your eyes on the spot of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">over my head when I began my prayer?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We nodded assent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That explains your bewilderment," he went on. "My</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayer and the light were designed for one thing alone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hypnotize such of the audience as were not in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret. Those who were, looked another way and</seg><seg type="columnLine">932</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped their ears. The reason for the ceremony is this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ancient Atlanteans, from whom the Bearers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burdens are descended, were a barbarous race who prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tised human sacrifice, temple harlotry and religious can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nibalism. Despite six thousand years of attempts to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cducate them, we have done little toward improving them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and have suppressed the practises I have named only</seg><seg type="columnLine">by force. Fortunately we have almost eliminated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst of the three, for cannibalism is hardly known.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even so, as recently as two years ago, a number of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">children were missed and their bones, when found,</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed evidence of the horror which had been perpe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In order to pacify them and make the problem of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their control easier, we contrived some two thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago, the Golden Calf and the ceremonies with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it is worshiped. At first we were forced to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">actual human sacrifices, but about twelve hundred years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago, the Master, who had an unusually far seeing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">acute mind, devised the present ceremony where a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayer with attendant concentration on a spot of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the first step. This, when properly contrived, has the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect of so hypnotizing the audience that a dummy</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrifice can be carried out without their detecting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fraud. For over a thousand years, no human being</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been sacrificed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are always cautious that no extraneous sound in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrupts the ceremony and my only explanation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">events of this evening is that the sound of the shot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which one of you fired, broke the spell, and enabled</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to detect the fraud. This, showing them that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being cheated of the vicarious pleasure which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have annually felt in a blood sacrifice, enraged them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought to a sudden head, discontent which has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">brewing for the last thirty years."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then Estha knew that it was a dummy?" said Nanki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vell with an air of great relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly. All wearers of the blue and many of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more advanced of the Craftsmen knew it. There</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was interrupted by the entrance of a blue-clad</seg><seg type="columnLine">messenger who saluted and spoke rapidly. Zephaniah's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face assumed a look of anxiety and he questioned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">messenger sharply. The messenger answered and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worried look on the Master's face deepened. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke in English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Direct Brother Joel to make all haste possible in</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting the main emergency generator," he directed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and have the observation post manned as soon as there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is sufficient power. Bid them to report at the asylum</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the space of an hour."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The messenger saluted and left.

It seemed that we had barely lain down</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a messenger entered and bade us to the asylum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We rose and followed him through corridors to the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we had first been examined. Again the bowing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">files of Craftsmen opened before us and we approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway. We had no difficulty in gaining admission</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after the proper ceremonies took our places.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is my order," said Zephaniah when all had as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembled, "that the deliberation of this assembly be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducted in English for the benefit of our newly found</seg><seg type="columnLine">brethren. This you will proclaim."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The orders were duly repeated and Zephaniah turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an officer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Brother Steward," he said, "report the state of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stores."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Most Worshipful Sir," was the reply, "the stores are</seg><seg type="columnLine">in excellent condition and are in full quantity for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">period of seventy years for those here assembled."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is well," said the Master. "Brother Armorer, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">is your report?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Most Worshipful Sir," replied the officer to whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question had been addressed, "there is an abundance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of charged tubes and all else needful for our proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">defense."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Brother Scribe," said the Master, "declare the num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of the brethren."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of the purple; two; one present and one imprisoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Vault, but reported well and safe.

There has been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">traitor in' our midst."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Master bowed his head while a murmur of aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishment ran around the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Worshipful Brother Amos, who was deposed thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">two years ago from the throne which you now occupy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not in our midst. We thought that he had been killed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he has been located and has joined forces with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bearers of Burdens. We cannot see the interior of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crypt due to its protection, but since the air compressors</seg><seg type="columnLine">are already driving air through the underground dwell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, it is evident that he has forced the Crypt before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators could be destroyed and has them in operation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Although the Crypt is in his possession, the Vault has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been closed and he has but a small store of energy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which to feed his generators. Still, with care, it may</seg><seg type="columnLine">last him for years, especially as the Bearers of Burdens</seg><seg type="columnLine">will now live above ground and the great energy used in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air compressors will be saved."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What of the Vault?" asked the Master anxiously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Vault is safe. Brother Zerubbabel holds it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has lowered the emergency doors so that he is protec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted by miles of rock from the Crypt.

Always enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy has been stored in the sanctuary storehouses to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet our anticipated needs for sixty years. Brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amos, as you know, had it in his care. He has stolen it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the sanctuary and there remains only base metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">and enough units of energy to maintain our observation</seg><seg type="columnLine">posts and to supply the ordinary comforts of life for</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DRUMS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF TAPAJOS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">933</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">five years with great economy. If we endeavor to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">the projectors, we will exhaust our store in a month."</seg><seg type="columnLine">A dead silence greeted this announcement for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and than an undertone of muttered imprecations</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the traitor ran around the hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My order is recalled," said the Master. "Let us take</seg><seg type="columnLine">counsel. Has any brother anything to offer?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fruitless discussion which followed lasted for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several hours, but no one had a constructive suggestion</seg><seg type="columnLine">to offer. The final conclusion reached was that energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be conserved in every way possible and that only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minimum of observation should be used and that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory would work night and day in an attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find a substitute for the missing material, from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, atomic energy could be produced, so far as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">science of Troyana was concerned. At length the meet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing adjourned with prayer and Nahum hastened up to us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My brethren," he exclaimed as he greeted us warmly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We had given both you and the Master up for lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you appeared and he related how your bravery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and skill had delivered him from the hands of our ene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mies. There is nothing in Troyana that is not yours for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the asking. Zephaniah wished to keep you with him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but my prayers have prevailed, and you are to resume</seg><seg type="columnLine">your places as members of my household. Will you</seg><seg type="columnLine">come with me as soon as you have received the thanks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and felicitations of the brethren? My granddaughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">is awaiting your arrival anxiously."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were dog-tired and we managed to cut short the</seg><seg type="columnLine">congratulations and thanks which were pouring in on</seg><seg type="columnLine">us from every side and accompanied Nahum. The small</seg><seg type="columnLine">suite of rooms to which he led us contrasted poorly with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the luxurious mansion where we had formerly been</seg><seg type="columnLine">housed, but the warmth of the welcome which met us</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than made up for anything that may have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we entered, Estha, again in the blue robes of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">rank, ran forward and threw her arms around Nankivell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Frank," she half laughed and half sobbed, "I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you had been killed. Why were you so foolish as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to try to follow me? Didn't you realize that I was safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knew what I was doing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't think," he said as he drew her closer to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All I saw was that you were in danger and I jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out after you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Silly boy," she cried and kissed him. I glanced ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehensively at Nahum but that old gentleman had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creetly looked the other way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From another room Balkis and Adah entered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanked us prettily enough for what little we had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to do, but their thanks had none of the fervor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmth of Estha's. One would think that Frank Nanki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vell had done everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We sat up most of the night talking to Nahum and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we found that the seriousness of the situation had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been exaggerated. Energy in the peculiar form that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was adapted to the atomic disintegrators of Troyana was</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed life and death, as well as power of offense and</seg><seg type="columnLine">defense, to this people. It was true that their enemies</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a larger supply and had also one of the best minds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Troyana to supervise its expenditure, but due to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger number that they had to provide for and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost impregnable position in the fortified sanctuary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation was really a deadlock. If we could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing neither could they.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such was the situation and such it remained. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first few days were interspersed with attempts on our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">part, or on the part of the cohorts of Amos, to obtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">an advantage, but both were equally unsuccessful, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither of the two parties was in a position to expend the</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy to try a decisive blow. If such a blow were</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempted and failed, the attackers would find them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves at the mercy of their enemies and the fight soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed into a stalemate, each side waiting for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other to make a false move which would leave them at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mercy of their opponents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ZEPHANIAH did not forget his promise about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pedro. The day after we reached the sanctuary, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnificent ceremony was held in the asylum, where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master preached a moving sermon about the virtues of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidelity. He ordered Pedro's body embalmed and placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a mausoleum against the time when it could be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved and interred in the forest from which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. It was a touching ceremony and we all broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at the Master's words, Nankivell especially, crying</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a baby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three months passed in this fashion. Willis, Mariston</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Nankivell were assigned to duties connected with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the defense while I was put to work in the laboratory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My puerile knowledge of the science of Europe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">America poorly fitted me to aid in the advanced prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lems in the constitution of the atom which were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried out, but I was something of a technician and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was able to be of some small use, I hope. I did my best</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our hours of duty differed and I saw comparatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">little of either Willis or Nankivell. I saw Mariston</seg><seg type="columnLine">every day and he told me how things were going with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others. Willis was getting more and more impatient</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the outside world, but Nankivell would need a team</seg><seg type="columnLine">of horses to drag him away, it seemed. He was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely enslaved by our host's charming granddaughter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mariston did not think that Nahum altogether approved</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the intimacy and had, indeed, spoken rather sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Estha on several occasions and had finally requested</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell to cease his attentions. I felt that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather more than a friend of the old gentleman and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolishly enough took it on myself to remonstrate with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him about his attitude. I didn't get far.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Brother Duncan," he said sternly, "you are a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried brother and so is Brother Nankivell and to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">both Troyana owes a great debt, but there are limits</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond which no one may go. No matter how much</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brother Nankivell and my granddaughter may love one</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, nothing can come of it. He is of the outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">world and she is of Troyana and such a union would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sult disastrously. Already, in your hearts, you tire of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place and long for greater freedom. Should Estha</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Brother Nankivell unite, he would be tied here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a hundred years or so, he would chafe at his bonds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and become miserable, longing for the world he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">known, and his discontent would kill Estha. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other hand, she was born in Troyana and could not live</seg><seg type="columnLine">in happiness beyond its halls. Much as I love you</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers that one request I cannot grant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You said 'beyond the halls of Troyana,' " I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly, "do you mean that there is a chance of escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">from here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled in a wry fashion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am right as you can see," he replied. "At the mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion of a chance to leave this city, you are all</seg><seg type="columnLine">agog and yet you are better adapted to Troyana than</seg><seg type="columnLine">either Brother Nankivell or Brother Willis. Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">934</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Brother Duncan, there is a chance, but I can say no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. In due time you will learn if it be the Master's</seg><seg type="columnLine">will."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought that there were no secrets from those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue degree," I replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None save those pertaining to the Crypt," he replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Our entire knowledge is not confined to the operation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a few machines. I can say no more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told Mariston what Nahum had said to me and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">made us both think. It was, therefore, less of a sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise than it would otherwise have been, when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were summoned to the asylum one evening to an assem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bly of which we had not been notified. We were told to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand before the altar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My brethren," said the Master, "it grieves my heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you should think of leaving us, for I have come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">love you like sons, but Brother Nahum informs me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that your hearts are sore for your homes. Is it so ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">We bowed without speaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It grieves me greatly and I would hold you here by</seg><seg type="columnLine">love if I could, but I will not hold you here by force.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is a way to return you from here to the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">whence you came, although it is known to but few and</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be used only by those who are chosen. Also remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber that you came to Troyana of your own free will and</seg><seg type="columnLine">accord and so the way was open to you. So must you</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave, but once you have left the way will then be for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever closed to you and yours. Make not your decision</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily, my brethren, but consult one with the other and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow, here, give to the Council your answer. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">refuse, never again will the chance to depart be offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you. If you choose to go, never again may you re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn. Now go in peace and may the blessings of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Architect rest on you and may his wisdom guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to a true choice, for my mind is torn and I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">not how to advise you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silently we saluted and withdrew. Not a word did</seg><seg type="columnLine">we speak until we were back in our rooms. Willis first</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke the silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank God, we are getting out of this hole," he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed heartily.

There is a lot to be learned here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'd like to stay a few months, or even years, longer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that is out of the question. Since this is to be our</seg><seg type="columnLine">only chance to get out, possibly we ought to take it. I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to see Molly again, but on the other hand, aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">we almost in honor bound to stay and see the end of it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nonsense 1" said Willis hotly, "it's none of our fight."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Shut up, Ray," replied Mariston. "Let each man</seg><seg type="columnLine">have his say and then we'll argue it. What is your de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cision, Dune?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think we really ought to stick it out, even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would like to go," I answered with a heavy heart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thankful that Molly could not hear me say it, "I vote</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stay here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to stay," said Nankivell shortly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because of Estha?" asked Mariston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nankivell nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the very reason why you are going," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mariston. "I am the exact opposite of Duncan. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would like to stay but I vote for going and so will you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frank, when' you hear me. I won't stay because of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Balkis. A little longer in her company and I wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to go and Nahum has shown me very plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that nothing more tragic than a marriage between one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them and one of us could happen. Neither Estha</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor Balkis could live in the world as we know it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">be happy and neither of us could live happily in Troyana.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each must keep to his own country, old man. Oil and</seg><seg type="columnLine">water won't mix, excellent as each one is alone. No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frank, you're going out with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And leave her ? I will not!" said Nankivell hotly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, you will, old man, and for the very reason that</seg><seg type="columnLine">now makes you declare you are going to stay. Because</seg><seg type="columnLine">you love her, you'll leave her. I'll talk with you tonight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I think that I can make you see it. Dune, you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">free to do as you please, for you have 110 foreign en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanglements. If the rest of us go, will you go or stay?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll let majority rule," I answered with a heart sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly lighter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right then, that's settled. We leave," said Maris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may, but I won't," retorted Nankivell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll see what you say in the morning," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mariston. "Dune, you and Ray turn in. Frank, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">come with me.

Whatever the cause was, I slept very poorly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whenever I woke, which I did at frequent intervals, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear Nankivell and Mariston arguing in the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. There was no doubt in my mind that the course</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Mariston advocated was that of common sense,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I couldn't help sympathizing with Nankivell. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to think what my decision would be under such</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances, but the problem was too much for me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thankful that I did not have to advise Nankivell, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally settled myself to sleep with a feeling that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter was on the knees of the gods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither Mariston nor Nankivell volunteered any in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation at breakfast the next morning and neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willis nor I cared to question them. When the meal</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been finished Nankivell arose with a muttered word</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what seemed to be rather sullen apology and left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. We turned to Mariston questioningly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">■	"He's going," said Mariston. "It is a pretty hard blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, but I made him see the light. I wouldn't say</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything about it to him if I were you.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">disinclination to talk about the matter had left him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he chatted with us in a normal manner and seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost eager in planning our return.

I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mariston's fist clenched and he shot me a dark look,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Nankivell answered promptly without a trace of em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrassment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DRUMS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF TAPAJOS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">935</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She took it rather hard at first, just as I did," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered, "but she soon saw the force of Bob's argu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. Balkis was there and when she heard that Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">favored our leaving, she sided with him and agreed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the course we were taking was by far the wisest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some reason, Mariston did not look entirely happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Nankivell's words. He flushed slightly and was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak when the entrance of Nahum put an end to</seg><seg type="columnLine">further conversation. Nahum saluted us affectionately</seg><seg type="columnLine">and told us that the Council had assembled and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaiting our arrival. At his suggestion we donned our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceremonial robes of blue and followed him to the asylum.-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our entrance was affected by the usual ceremonies, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we were by then sufficiently familiar to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">through with in Hebrew without assistance. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">conducted to the altar before the Master who greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">us courteously and asked if we made our decision."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We have, Most Worshipful Sir," replied Mariston</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was naturally the spokesman of our party.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Communicate it to me," directed Zephaniah.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have decided, with your gracious permission, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to the place whence we came," he answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It grieves me greatly so to hear," replied the Master,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and yet I applaud your answer as that directed by wis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom. Brother Nankivell, is this decision made of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own free will and accord, made without outside in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluence, without fear of punishment or hope of reward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and without possibility of future retraction?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is," answered Nankivell promptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The same question was propounded to each of us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we had all answered in the affirmative, the Master</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced himself as satisfied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In order to teach you the means of departure, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be necessary to communicate to you certain portions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Cryptic Degree," he went on. "This will involve</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking upon yourselves certain additional oaths, obli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gations and duties in addition to those which you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitherto taken and have observed. The assurances which</seg><seg type="columnLine">have previously been given to you are repeated. Being</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus reassured, are you willing to proceed?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We answered in the affirmative.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is my order that this assembly of Planners be now</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed," he proclaimed. "Brother Chancellor, is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master of the Cryptic Degree within the sanctuary or</seg><seg type="columnLine">has he furnished you with orders?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Most Worshipful Sir, he is not within the sanctuary</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no orders have been received from him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then, by virtue of my authority as the Worshipful</seg><seg type="columnLine">Senior Warden of the Cryptic Degree, in the absence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Right Worshipful Master, it is my order that an</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembly of the Cryptic Degree be now opened," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Brother Chancellor, you will clear the asylum</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all who have not been exalted. Brother Chamberlain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will prepare the candidates."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My obligation forces me to draw the veil over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elaborate and very impressive ceremonies that occupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next three hours. Suffice it to say, that in the end,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we found that we had learned many things. Not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">had we learned how we were to leave the city, but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had learned something that was of the greatest scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest, to me at least. The peculiar form of energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was used in the atomic generators of Troyana, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcity of which was causing so much concern, was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparatively common element, cobalt. There was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one source of this material within the limits of Troyana</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that was in the Vault, which was always guarded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the three Keepers of the Sacred Treasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the conclusion of the ceremonies, Zephaniah gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">us our final orders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My brethren," he said, "the night has far advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the rest of it and the day are given you for repose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and refreshment. Tomorrow night at the second hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">before dawn, you will come here prepared to depart. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slight token of my esteem and gratitude, the Steward</seg><seg type="columnLine">will bring to each of you a small package. In it you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will find enough diamonds to enable you to live without</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grim necessity of manual labor, as becomes nobles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Troyana in the outside world, to which you are going.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I trust that you will use the leisure which this gift will</seg><seg type="columnLine">grant to you, in labor for the good of mankind, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially your brethren. Is there any other thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is within my power to grant that you desire?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is, Worshipful Senior Warden," replied Nan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kivell. "There reposes in the sanctuary the body of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear friend who gave his life for me and also, in a meas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure, for you. I would like to be given his body so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I may take it with me and lay it respectfully to rest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest whence he came."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your request is granted," answered Zephaniah. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is such a request as I would expect to hear from you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brother Nankivell. Do any other of you have a desire?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then may the blessings of the Great Architect rest on</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and on us all and may you go your ways ever in</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace. Amen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So mote it be!" came a deep-toned chorus from</seg><seg type="columnLine">around us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day passed rapidly. It took time to go the rounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sanctuary and bid farewell to our many friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Troyana and many of the farewells were sad and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to say, for we had made real friends there and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">all knew that it was a last farewell, for it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeatedly told to us that there was no retracing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">route which we were taking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We changed our Troyana robes for the tramping gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments in which we had entered the city and made up</seg><seg type="columnLine">our packs, substituting for the missing sarque and</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarana, some of the marvelous concentrated foodstuffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which the sanctuary contained so large a store. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were ready for travel and had tested the weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our packs, Willis was disposed to object to the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition of the weight of Pedro's body to our load. Maris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton was non-committal, but I sided strongly with Nanki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vell. I felt that he was giving up enough as it was and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, if he felt like taking Pedro along, that that much</seg><seg type="columnLine">was due him. Anyway, Nankivell flatly refused to move</seg><seg type="columnLine">a step without it, so Willis was forced to give way. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did so and agreed to take it, at least as far as the jungle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although he grumbled a little at what he termed 'senti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental damnfoolishness'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS midnight approached, Nankivell left us and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">&gt;. to prepare Pedro's body for the trip. He declined</seg><seg type="columnLine">my proffered assistance and I stayed with Mariston and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willis, who were engaged in going, for the twentieth</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, over our return route after we had left the road.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our instructor was Hosea, the Junior Deacon, who had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at one time, spent forty years in the jungle as Warder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Outer Ways. With the aid of his detailed instruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, a map he drew, and our compasses and pedom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eters, we had little fear of going astray. In addition</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gave to us a sign which he assured us would be heed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed by the Cowans who guarded the jungle trails and tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">them that we had a right to pass and repass at will.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last the hour arrived.</seg><seg type="columnLine">936</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dune, come and help me with the body, will you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Nankivell from the next room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went to him and found that he had wrapped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body in many folds of linen and had tied it securely. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight rather surprised me, as I had an idea that an em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">balmed body was always lighter than a living one, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I accounted for the weight by the large quantity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrappings he had put on it. He took the head and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feet and we followed our guides to the asylum which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been cleared of all save those of the Cryptic Degree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Our final farewells and prayers were here spoken and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Steward handed to each of us the packages which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zephaniah had promised the day before. When all was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready, we stepped back from the altar and Zephaniah,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a final word of prayer, spoke certain words. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">response to his commands, the altar revolved slowly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side and we followed Nahum down the flight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs which the movement had revealed. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick with dust of ages and small wonder, for we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned the night before that they had not been used for</seg><seg type="columnLine">over six hundred years. I tried to count steps, but at</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere around five hundred and fifty, I lost count.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down and down we went, into the very bowels of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, stopping now and then to rest. The weight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pedro's body became a heavy burden but Mariston and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willis relieved me from time to time. Exhausted as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been, Nankivell refused to surrender his place</seg><seg type="columnLine">to anyone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At last we came to level ground, or rather a level pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage in the rock, and Nahum told us that we were below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the level of the Crypt. For perhaps two miles we fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed him along the passage, which was dimly lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a hand lamp which he carried, and then, at a word</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him, we paused. He advanced to the wall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">manipulated some dials and levers and we saw on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall before us, an empty corridor. Rapidly he searched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rooms and corridors adjacent to the one we had first</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen and then spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When the door opens, move rapidly," he directed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We must move some twenty yards and be in the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veyance that will take us to the entrance where you first</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw me before we are detected. The corridors approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the one we will enter are empty now but some may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be coming from a distance and, as you know, our convey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ances travel rapidly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Using the same words with which Zephaniah had</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved the altar, he lowered a door before us and strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly forward. The door closed behind him of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">own volition and in a few moments we were seated in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveyance and, although we knew that we were going</seg><seg type="columnLine">principally in a forward direction, the slight grade and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rapidity of our motion gave us the impression of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping. Presently this feeling passed and we felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were rising again. The car stopped and a door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened and we stood again in the corridor where we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">first met Nahum several months before. It seemed to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that only a few minutes had passed and I had to shake</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head to make me realize what we had been through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were not yet clear of the confines of Troyana and</seg><seg type="columnLine">already its wonders seemed like a dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door to the outside world opened at Nahum's</seg><seg type="columnLine">command and we stepped forth again on the road by</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we had first approached the lost city. Only,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of our faithful Pedro walking with us, his dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and embalmed body was borne sadly along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our parting with Nahum was brief, but sad. We had</seg><seg type="columnLine">all come to love the old gentleman, and he had grown</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fond of us, too, in his reserved way. He wrung us</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmly by the hand and wished us all good fortune with</seg><seg type="columnLine">equanimity, but when he came to say farewell to Nanki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vell I caught the suspicion of a tear in his eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Farewell, my son," he said slowly, "for as a son I</seg><seg type="columnLine">love you and it is my sorrow that you cannot actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">be my son. For your own good and for hers I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">acted and when the first pain has passed, you will each</seg><seg type="columnLine">bless me for my actions. And now, my brethren, may</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blessings of-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He essayed to give us the conventional blessing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Troyana but his voice broke and he turned hastily and</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreated into the hill and the massive door crashed shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that's that," remarked Willis, a little huskily, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we strode forward. His eye lighted suddenly. "Let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop and take a look at the rocks that Zephaniah gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">us," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," said Mariston, "Go ahead and look. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep my eyes open and be ready to make the peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal. I don't want to stop an arrow after all we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been through."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was no expert on gems, but Willis was. After a</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful examination, he announced that, at a conserva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive estimate, the diamonds that had been given us were</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth half a million dollars for each of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a bad haul," he commented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, it's not," replied Mariston thoughtfully, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">now that it's too late, I wish that I had sided with Dune</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Frank. I'd give the whole business for an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">more with Balkis."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dawn was just breaking as we started. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh muscles and a good road under us we made ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellent time, even with the handicap of our burden, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little over two hours of steady hiking brought us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point where we were to leave the road for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle. We rested for half an hour and then turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the trail and headed for our canoe, which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned on reaching by the night of the second day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks to the instructions for a better route which Hosea</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The trail along which we went was fairly open but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat began to get bad and the weight of our burden</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to increase momentarily. For two hours we</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled on and then Willis, who was carrying one end,</seg><seg type="columnLine">put it down and mopped his brow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Frank," he said, "I have given in to you on this mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter so far, but we are coming to harder going every</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute and I don't see how we are going to carry this</seg><seg type="columnLine">body any farther unless we throw away our guns and</seg><seg type="columnLine">packs and that would be suicidal. I appreciate your</seg><seg type="columnLine">feelings, but we have got Pedro back to the jungle, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it isn't his native one, and I don't see why we can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">bury him here just as well as any other place. At any</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate, I'm not going to carry him any farther."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MARISTON nodded assent and Nankivell turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I looked sheepish, but the thought of strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling under that burden any longer broke my spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I nodded as well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too bad," said Nankivell solemnly. "I had hoped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry it farther, but I can't do it alone and since you</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows won't help me, I'll have to give in. If it goes</seg><seg type="columnLine">any farther, it will have to go under its own power.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Help me to unwrap it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not bury it as it is?" I asked. "We have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of making a coffin here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DRUMS OF TAPAJOS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">937</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, let's have another look at him," protested Nanki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vell, his knife busy on the bindings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We cut the thongs and took off several layers of linen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell straightened up and looked at us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fellows," he said, "do me one favor, will you?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Step away a few paces and keep your backs turned while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I finish this job. I'd rather do it without witnesses."</seg><seg type="columnLine">We humored him and stepped away for a few paces.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We could hear him at work and presently his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke the stillness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, fellows, you can look now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We turned and looked. For a moment we stood there</seg><seg type="columnLine">smitten with amazement and then Nankivell's laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke the quiet. Before us was not the body of Pedro,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold in death, but instead, standing there smiling, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Estha.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mariston was the first to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the-? how the-?" he sputtered, "Frank,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">what the devil does this mean ?"•</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, nothing much," said Nankivell airily. "I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you had the drop on me when it came to arguing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I gave up and put the problem up to Estha. She felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">just like I did about it, but we knew that we couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">win you over, so we just decided to let you have your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own way and make a private addition of our own to</seg><seg type="columnLine">your plans and we did ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When was this planned?" asked Mariston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The day before yesterday. That was why I was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to fall in with your ideas when I came back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking to Estha. Balkis helped us out on it and if there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been some way of bringing her along, too, we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have let you in on it, but there wasn't. Anyway, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't even told Balkis that you wanted her to come."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You know that you can never go back," Mariston</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to Estha</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't want to," she said. "I made up my mind to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come with Frank, just as you made up your mind to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave Balkis. We'll see in a few years which one of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the wisest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll have to change our plans," interrupted Willis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We can't go on on this rpute for they know just how</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are going. We'll have to hunt another trail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think so," replied Nankivell. "In the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, Estha is in bed sick in Troyana so far as Nahum</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows and I think that Balkis can keep him fooled until</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are on the river. There is no use in changing routes</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway. We have to go to the river eventually and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we took a longer path they would just cut us off at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canoe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's some sense in that," remarked Willis. "Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Estha, you know Nahum's disposition better than we do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Will there be any pursuit?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't tell," she answered. "I am his only descend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant and he loves me greatly and if I were dragged back</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would mean my death. One of the most immutable</seg><seg type="columnLine">laws of Troyana is that of prescribing death for desert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers. That is all that I can tell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I doubt greatly whether there will be any," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mariston. "Even if Nahum urged it, I don't believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zephaniah would authorize any of the remaining few of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cryptic Degree to leave the city. I am more afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Amos may find out that we have left the city and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursue us. Nahum's only chance would be to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cowans sent after us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think that there is much danger of either</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those contingencies happening," I said. "Amos has</seg><seg type="columnLine">too little cobalt to waste any of it in wildcat observation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the jungle and I don't think that he will ever see us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As far as calling the Indians is concerned, I am positive</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Zephaniah would not allow the projectors to be used</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that purpose for they take a tremendous amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">power and he has less than Amos has. There is another</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to remember; we have in no way violated our obli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gations and I never heard of a woman taking any. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to me that Zephaniah has no real grounds on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which to base a pursuit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's all true," mused Mariston. "I expect that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best thing for us to do is to keep on with our original</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans. If Zephaniah wants to see us, no route that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can take will balk him for we have to move by the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">in any case. We are safe from the swamps along this</seg><seg type="columnLine">route, thanks to Hosea's map and there are Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere. Miss Estha, is that cloth impregnated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Certainly," she replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then the only suggestion that I would make is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Estha walk between Frank and me and that we each keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">a portion of it around us like a robe. That may protect</seg><seg type="columnLine">her from casual observation and at night we can rig a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent of it that she can sleep under. That's about all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can do, except to make as good speed as possible and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust to luck to get out of it with whole skins."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the formation which Mariston had suggested, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged ahead into the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell to the Rescue</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE route which Hosea had taught us was a vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">improvement over the one by which we had ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached Troyana. The ground was higher and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more open and the terrible plague of insect life which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tormented us was, to a large extent, missing. Estha's</seg><seg type="columnLine">costume was hardly such as an experienced traveller</seg><seg type="columnLine">would choose for a jungle trip and, had we tried to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace our steps over the old route, her sufferings would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been terrible. Even as it was, the mosquitos and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ticks were present in large enough numbers to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the journey unpleasant, to say the least.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We plodded on for nearly three hours before the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasing heat forced us to stop for rest. According to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our pedometers, we had thus far traversed nearly thir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen miles from the spot where we had left Nahum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mariston suggested that we make a tent of the tin-im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pregnated linen which we had brought from Troyana</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I tried to do so, but when I had it constructed, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was evident that she could not stay in it. The thick, close</seg><seg type="columnLine">weave of the cloth cut off every bit of air and made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent like the inside of a baking oven. Even Bob admit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted, after he had spent a few minutes in its shelter, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his idea was impractical. The next best thing that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could suggest was to rig some of it as a canopy over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head of the entire party and rest on the ground under</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Even this made it hot but we felt that we could stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and that it might be of advantage as a partial shield</seg><seg type="columnLine">against casual observation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shall we set a watch ?" asked Nankivell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," replied Willis. "Remember that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are out in the jungle again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe that we ought to," agreed Mariston. "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">take it, if you wish."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, draw straws for it," I said. "The loser keeps</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch during the siesta and is relieved at night."</seg><seg type="columnLine">938</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fair enough," said Willis. "Bob, get four blades of</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass and we'll draw."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, after suggesting such a method, I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the unlucky one and draw the short blade of grass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The others laughed and threw themselves at full length</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ground to rest and sleep a couple of hours while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shouldered my rifle and fell to walking. Tired as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, I knew that I would drop off to sleep in a few mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments if I didn't keep moving. Forward and back I</seg><seg type="columnLine">paced, varying the monotony of my route by taking an</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional turn around the camp and fighting off fatigue</seg><seg type="columnLine">and weariness as best I could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The jungle was silent with the curious hush that often</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtakes the tropical jungle at noon on a quiet day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when even the insects seem to feel the heat and lie quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the temperature falls. The sweat trickled down</seg><seg type="columnLine">my face and dropped off the end of my nose and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of my chin and I didn't have enough energy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wipe it off. The quiet became oppressive and I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel my nerves drawing taut. There was absolutely not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sound that could have raised my suspicions, but I sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly felt that unseen eyes were peering at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I whirled suddenly in my tracks hoping to surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">some lurking spy but not a movement of a leaf re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warded my effort. With a shrug of my shoulders, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned my back and resumed my pacing but the feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was being watched grew stronger and stronger. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred to me that it was possible that one or more In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dians were lurking in the undergrowth and I laid down</seg><seg type="columnLine">my rifle and made the sign of peace toward each point</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the compass, but without result.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shook myself and resolved to throw off such childish</seg><seg type="columnLine">feelings and glanced at my watch. In an instant, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair rose on the back of my neck and I knew where were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the phantom eyes whose gaze I had felt. From the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the watch, long iridescent streamers, visible even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mid-day, were leaping. I turned toward the sleepers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strove to raise my voice to call them but an unaccount-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able feeling of weakness and lassitude seemed to en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velope me. I struggled against it and staggered forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoping to touch one of them, but my limbs seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of lead and I could barely drag them. My tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">was completely paralyzed. Nearer and nearer I strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled. It seemed for a moment that I would reach them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a weight seemed to be pressing on my shoulders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I staggered and then wilted slowly to the ground. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a last effort and rolled toward them, at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time exerting all of my will power in an attempt to cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bob!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 don't know whether my lips actually formed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word that my mind shouted, for just as I was about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter it, a wave of darkness swept over me and blotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">out all the scene before me. I was falling, falling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I came to myself with a start. My first impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that I had fallen asleep on guard but a moment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrated effort enabled me to recall what had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened. I jumped to my feet with a start and the cry that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had started burst from my lips in a shriek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bob!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mariston raised his head with a grunt but Willis</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang to his feet like a startled deer, his pistol in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand by the time he had risen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?" he demanded, looking around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," I stammered. "I must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreaming. Is everything all right ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, yes," he answered looking down. "No, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder, it isn't. Frank! Bob! Turnout! The girl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gone?" I gasped stupidly. The fumes of that strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep seemed to still clog my brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For answer he pointed at the place where Estha had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lain. It was empty, although the impress of her body</seg><seg type="columnLine">still showed faintly on the vegetation. By this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell and Mariston were on their feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Estha?" were Nankiveil's first words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gone," I mumbled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gone ? Where did she go and when ?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," I replied feebly. "She was there all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right a few minutes ago, but when I woke up she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When you woke up ?" asked Mariston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," I returned. "I dropped off to sleep and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I woke up she was gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH an inarticulate cry of rage Nankivell sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me, his face working convulsively and in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes the light of murder. Willis caught him as he leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the face of his strength Nankivell's struggles</seg><seg type="columnLine">were as those of a child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steady, youngster" admonished Willis. "Keep your</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The damned traitor went to sleep and let her be</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolen," gasped Nankivell as he made another attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take it easy, boy," counseled Willis. "You aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to make matters any better by acting like a kid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sit quiet and let's hear about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nankivell struggled for a moment longer but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless in Willis' grasp and gradually his rage subsided</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he ceased struggling. Willis quietly sat him on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground but kept a sharp eye on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How did it happen, Dune ?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I collected my scattered wits and told him as clearly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could. When I came to the matter of the watch he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew in his breath with a sharp hiss but he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupt me until I had finished. Nankivell had watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with an angry glare in his eyes as I started my tale</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as the story progressed the anger faded from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and when I had finished he rose and held out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I beg your pardon, Dune," he said simply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shook his hand in silence. It was the first word of</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger that I had ever received from Frank Nankivell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the handsome way in which he atoned for his out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst made me forgive him without rancor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So, old Nahum got her back," mused Willis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nahum or Amos," answered Mariston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By thunder, that's right!" exclaimed Willis. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been either bunch. Both of them have ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servation posts and projectors at their service. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to you, Dune?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rays of some sort," I answered. "They affected my</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch and that is proof to me that they came from Troy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ana projectors, just what they were, I don't know. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">got the Cryptic Degree so hurriedly that I couldn't digest</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What difference does it make?" cried Nankivell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We've got to go after her at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long has it been since you were knocked out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dune?" asked Willis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced at my watch and gave a cry of surprise. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been just a few minutes after eleven when I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DRUMS OF TAPAJOS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">939</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seen the rays playing on it and when I looked again it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was half past five.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Over six hours' start," said Willis when I told him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They had plenty of time to get back on the road or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the city itself. I am afraid that a chase would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeless unless we were willing to follow her back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city or even into the sanctuary itself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'll follow her to hell 1" replied Nankivell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There or heaven is where you'll probably wind up if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you try to follow her," answered Willis quietly. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be pitch dark in another hour and a half and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't hope to make the road by that time. We will</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to wait here for the night and that gives them an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other twelve hours of start which would assure their re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to the city before we left this spot. I'm afraid that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's hopeless."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mariston slowly nodded assent. Nankivell looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one to the other and then at me. The force of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willis' arguments was too much for me and I silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook my head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So none of you have the guts to go back with me," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried. "All right, I'll do better without a bunch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">quitters with me anyway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seized his rifle and pack from the ground and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started toward the trail. He cast a scornful glance around</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw that Mariston was calmly adjusting his pack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What are you doing?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, don't be such a fool, Frank," replied Mariston in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a weary voice. "If you are going back, I'm going with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, of course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nankivell hesitated and I moved slowly over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to sling my pack. He looked at me questioningly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course Bob's going," I said as I picked up my</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle. "In point of fact, we're all going. I don't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there is one chance in a million that any of us will</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever live to see Troyana, let alone the sanctuary, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll try it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," chimed in Willis as he struggled with his pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">straps, "It's the craziest stunt that I ever heard of, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">if that fool youngster just naturally insists on getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself killed, I might as well keep him company."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell's face grew as red as fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I beg your pardon, fellows," he stammered. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are real pals, all right, but you mustn't go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not?" demanded Mariston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, it's just as Dune says. I haven't one chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a million to ever win through and you mustn't throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">away your lives on a wild-goose chase like that. Besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you fellows have nothing to gain and everything to lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'm just the other way around."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, shut up and quit arguing," said Mariston rudely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you go, we go, and that's all there is to it. We're</seg><seg type="columnLine">just wasting time. Before we start, however, we ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to decide where we are going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why to Troyana, of course," exclaimed Nankivell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What particular part?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nankivell paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wherever Estha is," he replied after a moment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Agreed, but where shall we try first, the sanctuary</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the city? If we go to the sanctuary after the road is</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed to us, it means sudden and painful death, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowing that we can get there, or I miss my guess. Iif</seg><seg type="columnLine">we go to the city, it means slower but considerably more</seg><seg type="columnLine">painful death. In neither case will we probably see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Estha, even if we chose the right place to look for her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's your funeral, Frank, take your choice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can decide that as we go," replied Nankivell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There is another point that may not have occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you," said Willis. "It's just possible that we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be going straight away from her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is more than possible that Nahum, if he is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party responsible for her absence, has communicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Warder o'f the Outer Ways and the Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards have captured her and have her here in the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">where she will be kept until we are disposed of."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell's face blanched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think that possible?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "More than possible," said Mariston. "I hadn't thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it before, but now that Willis has mentioned it, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems quite probable. He would know that you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotfoot it back and he might very easily have done that</seg><seg type="columnLine">very thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you think is the best thing to do ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's too late to do much of anything tonight," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willis. "It is getting too dark to trail right now and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">another hour it will be entirely dark. If we are going,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best thing to do is to wait for daylight and see if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can't pick up a trail. If we can, all right. If we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't, we can hit for Troyana and go it blind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nankivell grudgingly assented to Willis' program</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we made camp for the night while the light still</seg><seg type="columnLine">lasted. Before we had our netting up darkness had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen and the booming of mosquitos prophesied torment</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the unlucky men who had to mount guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE long sleep we had had in the afternoon had</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested us and we sat up and discussed plans until</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly midnight. Gradually the conversation lagged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently a gentle snore from Willis proclaimed his de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parture into the land of dreams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not sleepy, Bob," said Nankivell. "I am so wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried that I wouldn't sleep anyway. I'll take the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch and when I get tired, I'll call you or Ray."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mariston sleepily grunted an assent and Nankivell</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his rifle and slipped out from under the covering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a while I watched him pace his beat, dimly outlined</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the brilliant moonlight that filtered down through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves, and than I joined Mariston in sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I woke to find it broad daylight and Mariston shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">me by the shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here, Dune," he said handing me a sheet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper. I stared dumbly at it for a moment and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized it as a sheet torn from a notebook which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen in Nankivell's possession. I turned it over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that both sides were covered with tiny writing done</seg><seg type="columnLine">in pencil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "1:30 A.M." it read, "Dear fellows: I have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking it over and I know that I have no right to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">you go with me, especially after what 1 have seen to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. While I was on guard, I heard the drums again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew that it meant death for the one who heard them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I didn't wake you, but kept a close watch. The drum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming grew louder and louder and I thought that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head would burst and then I saw her. I tell you, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, as though she were standing before me. Her arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">were bound and she stood before the altar of the Golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Calf with a dozen Burden Bearers around her. I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">then where she was. She didn't know that I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">or hear her. The brutes were threatening her in Atlan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tean and she looked at them proudly and shook her head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said something. One of them struck her with a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of whip that he held and she cried 'Frank.' That settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">940</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it for me. I am going to her, although I know that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am watched and haven't a dog's chance to win through,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I'll die trying to reach her anyway. I didn't wake</seg><seg type="columnLine">you because I know that you would insist on going along</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I don't want you to. I took all of the ammunition</seg><seg type="columnLine">except twenty rounds for each of you because I may</seg><seg type="columnLine">need it. I have left my share of Zephaniah's diamonds</seg><seg type="columnLine">in payment. Divide them equally between you. Please</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't try to follow me, fellows, I will have four or five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours start and you can't catch me. By the time you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could leave the camp, I will be in Troyana--or dead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good-bye, fellows, and thanks for the help you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">give me if I woke you. Frank."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I read the message twice before I spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are we going to do?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What can we do?" asked Mariston sadly. "Frank</seg><seg type="columnLine">is right. He is either in Troyana or heaven by now. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought that there was one chance in a million of win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning through and helping him, I'd go after him, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been clever enough to stop us entirely."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How so ?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He took nearly all the ammunition," replied Mariston.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It would be folly to try to storm Troyana with three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and fifty rounds; it would be suicidal to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with fifty-three, and that is all he has left us. He has</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken my automatic, too. No, Dune, he evidently meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">it when he said that we were not to follow him. I hate</seg><seg type="columnLine">as badly as you do to desert him but it can't be helped."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard footsteps and looked up. Willis was approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the direction of Troyana.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I followed his trail for about half a mile and then lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">it on hard ground," he reported. "His tracks are at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least five hours old and he headed straight for the road.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm afraid that there isn't a bit of use in trying to over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed like the basest kind of treachery to desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">him but there was nothing else to do. Without ammuni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and short one pistol, it would indeed have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">suicidal to try to storm the halls of Troyana, especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we had abundant reason to know that our every</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement was watched and that our enemies would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaiting us. If we had had the least idea that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">even alive, I think that we would have gone after him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the odds were so great that he was dead, that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally gave tip discussing it and turned our faces sadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward home again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXII</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Warder of the Outer Ways</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A LL day we doggedly made our way onward. Thq</seg><seg type="columnLine">plague of insect life was not as bad as it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">X X- on the outward trip, but the ticks and mosquitos</seg><seg type="columnLine">were numerous enough to make it very unpleasant for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. Toward evening the ground began to fall rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the jungle to get thicker, sure proof to Willis that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were approaching the river. We came to a stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">that led in the general direction that we were going and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we essayed to follow it, but the multitudes of leeches</seg><seg type="columnLine">which fastened on us soon forced us to take to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle again and work our way through the lianas and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other creeping plants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By nightfall we had covered a good distance, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly as we could judge from Hosea's map, we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">within six miles of the place where we had left our</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe. The last two miles had been through mud that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was ankle deep and the prospect of spending the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">half sunk in the ooze and slime underfoot was not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">that induced us to linger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How about it, Ray?" asked Mariston, "shall we try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep on going in the hope of reaching the canoe to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willis studied the ground before replying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think so," he answered. "In the first place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as the sun sets, it will get as dark as the inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a cow here and I doubt whether we could keep our</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction close enough to make any speed, even with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid of the luminous compass. We would probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">wander around and not make over two miles forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the entire night. I hate to sleep in this muck as</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly as you do, but I think that it's the only thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly we set our watches and Mariston and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willis stretched themselves in the mire after a meager</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper and left me on guard. I found it almost impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible to keep awake. The steady marching of the day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coupled with the stirring events we had gone through,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had exhausted me both mentally and physically and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was soon sure that the watch which I was keeping was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">lax as to be practically worthless. My tour finally ended</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I hesitated whether or not to call Willis, who had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle watch. I realized that he was as tired as I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I finally lay down beside him without calling him. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that if we were doomed to be surprised that night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that such a watch as any one of us could manage to keep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not prevent it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The false dawn had died and the short period of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense darkness that heralds the true dawn was at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">densest when I awoke with a start. I sat bolt upright</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening intently, but no matter how I strained my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears there was no sound that would account for my sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den start into complete wakefulness. A glance at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of my watch showed me that it was behaving nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mally, although it still gave out an abnormally brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow from the excitation which it had recently received.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were, however, none of the long tell-tale streamers</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming from the dial and I shrugged my shoulders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that I must have been dreaming. I listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">again for a short time, but gave it up and lay down</seg><seg type="columnLine">again to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardly had I reached a prone position than I sat bolt</seg><seg type="columnLine">upright again with another start. Faint and far-distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and almost imperceptible it was, but none the less I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. It was the fatal drums of Tapajos. It was so faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I thought for a moment that I must be dreaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I tried plugging up my cars with my fingers. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">test resolved the last of my uncertainty, for it intensified</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drumming. With a groan I reached over and grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willis by the shoulder to shake him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At my touch he sprang to his feet in that state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete wakefulness that characterizes animals and</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks men who have spent their years in danger of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?" he asked in an undertone as he surveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country as best he could in the darkness, his drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shhhh!" I whispered, "Listen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bent his head and listened. The drumming had</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentarily ceased and he held his strained attitude.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While he was listening I shook Mariston and he sat up</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly, but much more slowly than the cat-like bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had characterized Willis' awakening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The three of us stood with straining ears, listening for</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DRUMS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF TAPAJOS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">941</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">any sound from the jungle. The usual nocturnal noises</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the jungle were silent for the most part and only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint hum of insect life was audible. Willis' hearing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">keener than mine and he caught the sound of the drum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming before either Mariston or I did, when it started</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The drums 1" he muttered hoarsely. "What the devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">is it, Dune? Are those devils after us again?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hush!" exclaimed Mariston. "See if it is getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">louder. It may not be meant for us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We listened intently and for a moment I hoped that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mariston's words might have some foundation in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the sound got no louder and, indeed, seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying out. Fainter and fainter it got until we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly distinguish it again and then, for a moment, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased. As it stopped, a faint whisper of sound came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us from miles away. It was faint and almost indistin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guishable among the other faint noises of the night, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was enough to blanch our faces with terror. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distant long-drawn-out hunting cry of the Guardian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it died away in the distance, so far away in fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the bubbling grunt which ordinarily ended it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">totally inaudible, the drums started again and this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were unquestionably louder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While we had been listening, the dawn had started and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could dimly see one another's outlines. I looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others and met questioning glances from them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Listen!" said Mariston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still faint and far-distant it was, but appreciably</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer than it had been the first time. There w'as no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt that it was the cry of the Guardian, for the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">call was audible to our sharpened senses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damn it!" exploded Willis. "Why in thunder didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frank leave us more ammunition?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind Frank," I replied, "the question is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">what Frank left, but what are we to do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing that I know of," said Mariston with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirthless laugh. "There aren't any trees here that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can climb, as there were a few miles back, and we know</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough of that creature to realize how futile a Spring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field bullet is going to be. Of course we can scatter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be one will get through, but since the brutes hunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">in packs of three I don't think that will do much good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE drumming was more distinct now. From time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to time it would die out until it was almost inaudi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble and then would come that horrible blood-curdling</seg><seg type="columnLine">shriek, each time nearer than the time before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It won't be long now," said Mariston with a sickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin in what was evidently an imitation of Nankivell's</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's scatter," exclaimed Willis. "It's a slim chance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll admit, but I think it's our only one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were about to obey his suggestion when a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought struck me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a minute," I cried. "Bob, didn't Nahum tell us</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these brutes always traveled in packs with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Cowans along with them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, he did," said Mariston as he paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stick together then," I said. "Fellows, it's not hope-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less yet. We have the sign to give to the Cowans to</seg><seg type="columnLine">protect ourselves. If they approach within seeing dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance before these things get us, we may have a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right, Dune," cried Mariston. "Spread out a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">and make the sign as soon as those howls get close."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What about the drumming?" asked Willis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," he replied. "We've got to take some</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of a chance and I believe that Dune is right and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have a better chance this way than any other."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nearer and nearer came the howls of the approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guardian until it was evident that the pack was not more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a few hundred yards away in the jungle. As had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened in our previous encounter with them the cries</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly ceased, only to be repeated in a moment from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind us and then from one side. The beasts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling us only a short distance away and yet, despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">the size and apparent unwieldiness of their bodies as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen them in Nahum's instruments, not a trace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of their passage through the jungle could we</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear. We waited for their nearer approach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The drumming, which had grown more and more in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistent, rose to a crescendo and then came the hateful</seg><seg type="columnLine">whish of an arrow. I must have caught a glimpse of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it appreached, for without conscious volition I sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly threw the butt of my gun up before my face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well indeed was it for me that I did so for there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight jar on the gun and the thud of the arrow hitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wood was plainly to be heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The sign!" I gasped, "that arrow was meant to hit."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mariston and Willis dropped their guns and put them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves in the proper position and gave the sign. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly a weird call sounded in the jungle and the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Guardian was suddenly silent. The call was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated and I could make out the fact that it was sylla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bated but the language was one that I did not know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">None of us replied but I recovered my wits enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop my gun and join the others in making the sign.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again the weird call came insistently from the jungle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What are we supposed to do ?" asked Mariston.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Darned if I know," I answered. "Stand still. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the safest thing that I can think of."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I almost caught the words of that cry last time," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willis. "I wish the fool would repeat it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His wish was not long of fulfillment for again the cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose. Willis grunted in satisfaction and, pitching his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice on a peculiar low wailing note, he emitted a series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of syllables which meant nothing to me. Apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">they meant more to the rest of the auditors for the cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">came again from the jungle, this time comparatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">close.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Talk to them, Ray, that's a good chap," said Mariston</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervously. "Tell them that you're Santa Claus or some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut up!" ejaculated Willis as he replied again to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voice from the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some time the colloquy went on and then Willis</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are not satisfied," he said. "The sign is right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they don't dare to attack, but he claims that, if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were from Troyana as we say, that the drumming would</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop, or indeed, would never have started."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"It must be Amos who is drumming," I exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tell him who we are and the condition in Troyana."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't do it," interrupted Mariston. "If they know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the power of the Master is broken, or at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked, there is no telling what they will do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is the name of the Warder of the Outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ways?" I asked suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gedaliah," answered Mariston after a moment's</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ray," I said, "tell them to send for Gedaliah. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form them that, as wearers of the crimson, we order his</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediate presence here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">942</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good stuff," he answered and gave the message to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cowan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Indian replied and for several minutes the talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back and forth, Willis momentarily growing more</seg><seg type="columnLine">emphatic in his speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good," he said at length. "My knowledge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">names of the officers seemed to impress him. He says</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Gedaliah is a long way off but that he would deliver</seg><seg type="columnLine">our message to him. Meanwhile, we are to remain here</seg><seg type="columnLine">without stirring, as any attempt to move will result in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shower of arrows and an attack from the Guardian of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Jungle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fair enough," said Mariston. "Now there's nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do but wait. Let's make ourselves comfortable."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning passed away in silence. For some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drums kept up their throbbing but presently they</seg><seg type="columnLine">died away and quiet reigned. The sun rose higher and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began to yawn. Willis was already snoring and Maris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton was nearly asleep. Knowing that we were sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by enemies who could easily kill us without our</seg><seg type="columnLine">catching a glimpse of them, we had seen no object in</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping a watch. Indeed, as Mariston pointed out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting a watch would tend to make our attackers think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were uncertain of our standing. I was about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch myself out in the mud and take a nap when an</seg><seg type="columnLine">interruption came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I HAD been drowsing, but not asleep, and it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible that anyone could have approached me</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the rear without alarming me; but someone did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a voice spoke almost in my ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I jumped to my feet, rubbing my eyes in amazement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and confronted a stately grey-haired man. It did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">need the blue-bordered robe girded up over the leather</seg><seg type="columnLine">shod legs to tell me that one of the Planners of Troyana</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood before me. One glance at his hawklike visage told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me who he was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fraternal greetings, Brother Gedaliah," I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretching forth my hand. Willis and Mariston strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled to their feet as our hands met. Gedaliah looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with cold suspicion in his eyes, but as I applied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telltale pressure, the suspicion faded and was replaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a look of astonishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whence came you?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced around at the jungle. His glance followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine and a look of understanding came into his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He faced the jungle and gave some commands in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same peculiar wail which Willis had used in addressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Indians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now we can safely speak," he said with a smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few minutes of challenging assured him of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge and he began to question us. The word of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the revolt of the Bearers of Burdens had not as yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached him and he was smitten dumb for a few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I had finished outlining the state of affairs in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Troyana to him. Naturally, I said nothing of Estha or</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Nankivell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought it strange that I had received no orders or</seg><seg type="columnLine">communications from the Master for so long," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">at length, stroking his beard. "This, then, accounts for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silence. But what do you here? Why are you not</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking part in the defense?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I explained to him the reasons which had impelled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master to send us from the city and he bowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His orders shall be obeyed," he said. "My brethren,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stream which you seek is but five miles from here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your property has been moved from the place where</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you left it, but it shall be returned at once. Your canoe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, has been devoured by termites but I shall give</seg><seg type="columnLine">you guides and warriors who will quickly construct you</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new one and who will paddle you down to the Tapajos.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There you will release them and send back by them this</seg><seg type="columnLine">token, that it may be known that they have done what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ordered. I regret that I cannot go with you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give you my personal aid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are you going?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where could I go but to the rescue of the Master</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my brethren?" he asked. "I will summon all of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cowan guards and the packs of the Guardians from all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides and march at once to their rescue."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good for you!" exclaimed Mariston. "Would we</seg><seg type="columnLine">be of any help? We would be glad to accompany you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I appreciate your offer and the Master shall be in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed of it, if I ever see him," replied Gedaliah with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow. "It is what I should expect from loyal brethren.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Did not the Master, however, say that the way was for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever closed to you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He did," I admitted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then again I say, his orders shall be obeyed," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Warder. "And now may the blessings of the Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Architect rest on you and on all of our brethren and may</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace and happiness ever be yours. Go on your way and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear nothing. The guides will precede you and serve</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Leave your impedimenta. It will be carried by</seg><seg type="columnLine">your servants."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke words of direction to the forest and a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen Indians came forward and shouldered our goods</seg><seg type="columnLine">without speech and trotted away into the jungle. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched them go arid then turned to speak our thanks</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our new-found friend, but he had disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'll be darned," exclaimed Willis. "I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I could move quietly but he beats any Indian that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever saw. Well, anyway we don't have to carry all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">junk. Let's move."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With lighter hearts than we had since our awakening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we took up our march.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Call</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN we reached the bank of the river we</seg><seg type="columnLine">found all of our goods intact and the Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">busily engaged in making a new canoe for us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When it was finished, the skilled paddlers, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the stream like a book, whisked us down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rio Tapajos in short order. We dismissed them there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took the paddles ourselves and, although the pad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dling stiffened us up a little, we had the advantage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">having the current with us and we made good speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We passed Bacabal without stopping and arrived in good</seg><seg type="columnLine">time at Itaituba where our friend, Dom Esteban, wel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comed us as men returned from the dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is Pedro?" was almost his first question.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mariston told him something of the manner of Pedro's</seg><seg type="columnLine">death and the Dom stroked his beard reflectively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He was a good and faithful servant," he said, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtless his death was such as he would have chosen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will have many masses said for the repose of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Dorn's kind offices sped us on our way to Belem</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was only by requesting it of him as a favor, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could get him to retain one of the smallest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">diamonds with which Zephaniah had presented us. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DRUMS OF TAPAJOS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">943</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing worth noting in our trip to Belem nor in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip to New York which followed. I radioed Molly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was coming and it was a very excited young woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">who met me at the dock and dragged me away to "tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">her all about it," while Mariston and Willis took our</seg><seg type="columnLine">diamonds to Tiffany's for appraisal and safe-keeping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tiffany's experts warned us against flooding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">market, but they agreed to take them on consignment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">put them slowly into circulation for us. While they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not venture to give exact figures, they stated that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willis' appraisal was entirely too low and that the stones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">excluding a few of the finest which we kept, would net</seg><seg type="columnLine">us nearly a million each. One of the finest I had set in</seg><seg type="columnLine">platinum for Molly and requested both of my friends to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be present at the wedding, which would take place in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mariston accepted the invitation gladly, but Willis re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused. He said that it had been his life-long ambition</seg><seg type="columnLine">to buck the tiger at Monte Carlo and that was where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going on the next boat. He left in fine feather with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred thousand good American dollars to his credit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The day before the wedding, Mariston received a collect</seg><seg type="columnLine">cable from him in which he asked for the price of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticket home. Molly and I discussed the advisability of</seg><seg type="columnLine">delaying the wedding until he arrived, but Mariston</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not hear of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know Ray Willis," he said, "and he is just as likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go to Pekin as to return to New York. I want to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work myself and I never will while I have you two</seg><seg type="columnLine">children on my hands. Go ahead and get married and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave me in peace."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We followed his advice and did so. We both tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">insist that he make his home with us, for a time at least,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he would not hear of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't do it, Dune," he said. "I like you both, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would be in the way. You remember what Zephaniah</seg><seg type="columnLine">told us to do? I don't know how you are planning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry out his orders but I am going to Central America</seg><seg type="columnLine">and start a model fruit plantation where work shall be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done efficiently and where the natives shall get humane</seg><seg type="columnLine">treatment. I have knocked around there a good deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I know that something of the sort is needed and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that I may be able to do some good there and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do nothing here that others can't do a lot better."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am going to endow a private research laboratory,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I told him, "and try to develop into a usable form some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the knowledge that I picked up in Troyana. I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I can do more good in that way than in any other."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I agree with you," he said. "If your pile isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to carry out your ideas, mine is always at your</seg><seg type="columnLine">call. Meanwhile you and Molly can keep a room for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and Pll stay with you when I am in New York. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can let Ray stay there for a while when he comes back--</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he ever does. Now Pll leave you, for I am sailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a good thing that Molly and I did not wait for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willis' return to get married, for Mariston had spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisely. He didn't go to Pekin, but he did go to Alexan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dria and get mixed up in some excavation work that</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him foul of the Egyptian Government and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wire him ninety thousand dollars less than two years</seg><seg type="columnLine">later to get him out of the scrape. I told him that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a fortune waiting for him in New York and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabled back that he was coming after it, and this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came. I lost no time in getting in touch with Maris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton and a month later we three sat in my laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking over old times and wishing Nankivell was with us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor old Frank," said Willis, "I am sorry that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go and make such an ass of himself just when we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world by the tail. I wonder what ever became of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He was probably killed within an hour after he left</seg><seg type="columnLine">us," I replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think so, Dune," said Mariston with sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigor. "I believe that he won through."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What makes you think so ?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have felt for months that he was alive and trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to communicate with me," he answered. "I can't tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I feel it, but in my bones I do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you seen or heard anything that makes you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think so?" asked Willis, looking at him keenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing definite, no. Why do you ask?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because I have had the same feeling," said Willis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I have felt that something was just outside my con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness trying to get inside. Once in particular, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had some trouble with a bunch of fellaheen, who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">working for me, and one of them drugged me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasheesh. I felt then that I was on the borderland and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would have sworn that I heard his voice. I put it</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to a dream, but since you say what you do I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is strange," replied Mariston. "Twice I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen him in a dream. Each time he was attired in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimson robes of the Cryptic Degree and he tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a message across to me, but he couldn't do it. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you make of it, Dune? Have you had any such indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cations ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BEFORE replying to his question, I went to my safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brought out a file of laboratory records.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had not intended to mention this for I put it down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an over-active imagination on the part of one of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistants," I said, "but in view of what you have both</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt, perhaps I was wrong. About a year ago--by-</seg><seg type="columnLine">George, exactly a year ago today," I went on as I glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the date of the report in my hand, "one of my assis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tants told me that he had received a broadcast on an</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremely low wave length from an unknown station.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could not make out the words, but it was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a mare, a goat and a cobra. I tried to verify his</seg><seg type="columnLine">report but I could not locate the station."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mariston looked at the report.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mare, goat, cobra," he mused. "I can't see where</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything of that sort connects up with Frank."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is rather far-fetched," I admitted, but I wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it were possible that getting only a few words as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did that he might have only received a portion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones he did get. 'Mare' might be part of 'Mariston,' and</seg><seg type="columnLine">'cobra' might have been 'cobalt' but I can't connect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">goat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That doesn't seem very probable," said Mariston.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Your receipt of a message by means of instruments</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't check up with our reception very well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it were any place other than Troyana in question,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would lay the thing in the case of Ray to hasheesh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he admits he had, and in your case to morbid im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aginings," I said. "However, we all know that Troyana</seg><seg type="columnLine">has means of communication that are different from any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing we knew of, and they may be developing some</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of telepathy, which accounts for it. All of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">would tend to make me think strongly that Frank is alive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't believe in spiritualism."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Neither do I," said Willis, "although I have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">some mighty funny things that I could tell you about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">944</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">both in India and in Egypt. Have you ever heard from</seg><seg type="columnLine">your mystery station again?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No, I haven't," I replied. "I was trying at that time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact I am still trying, to perfect something along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of the observation instruments that they had in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Troyana. I have made absolutely no progress along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of vision, but I have developed a radio receiver that</seg><seg type="columnLine">picks up some of the lower harmonics of radio waves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was with the first of these that my assistant heard, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought he heard, that message. I have made better and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more powerful instruments since, but I haven't received</seg><seg type="columnLine">a word."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a might)' interesting start," said Mariston.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Would you mind letting us see them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Not at all," I replied as I led the way into the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">section of my laboratory and pointed out the apparatus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mariston turned on the current and revolved one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dials.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're way off," I laughed. "You are on a much</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorter wave length than any station sends on. Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me tune it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mariston shook his head and looked again at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">year-old report that he held in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am interested in that mystery station," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We ought to hear from it tonight, if ever."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why so ?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because it is just a year since you last heard," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered. "Did you ever try to connect up the date</seg><seg type="columnLine">with anything that happened on our trip?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought for a moment and an idea flashed across</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind. I went to my desk and got out the diary</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had kept during our trip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're right," I said as I verified the date. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is exactly two years to a day since Nankivell left us</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried to make his way back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly," he replied. "Energy is scarce in Troyana</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he would have to conserve it. It is natural that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would pick out this as the date for making an attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he would be sure that he would be more in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds on that day than any other."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Greatly excited, I turned to the receiver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is that the instrument on which you heard him be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore?" asked Willis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, this is an improved model," I answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Possibly you had better get the old one out," he sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested. "I am no scientist, but it strikes me that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be something about that old instrument that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">it especially good for the purpose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I assented and leaving Mariston to play with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new instrument, I went into the storeroom and dug</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the older receiver. It was a matter of ten minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">work to get it connected up with batteries and fitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with tubes. I consulted the old report and set the dials</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clamped on a headset. As I expected, there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">result.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me take it," suggested Mariston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded and he approached to take the dial. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did so, I paused in the act of taking off the headphones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were words, or at least a murmur of words, issu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I replaced the headset on my head but the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped. I cautiously lifted them again with no result.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, Dune?" asked Mariston, his voice quiver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't know," I replied. "I thought for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had something but it must have been imagination."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I surrendered my place to him and he began with in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">finite patience to turn the dials. Again and again he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran over the gamut of the low wavelengths to the limit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the receiver without result. At last he gave up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned away, giving the dial an idle twist as he did so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly his face froze in an expression of amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God, Dune!" he exclaimed in a whisper, "listen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took the phones from him and adjusted them but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could hear nothing and said so. He took them back and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">admitted that he could hear nothing himself. I looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">around and my attention w'as drawn by a restless move-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment on the part of Willis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have it," I exclaimed. "The position of our bodies</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">must have been such as to give exactly the right capacity</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the receiver to get that station through. Move up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to where you were Ray, and Bob, you try to get in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">same position."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For half an hour we squirmed around trying to re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">establish the broken circuit. Suddenly Mariston held</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm getting it, fellows," he whispered, "keep steady</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as you were."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He listened again and an expression of positive awe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">overspread his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, Bob?" I whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Quiet," he replied, "it's Nankivell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willis and I involuntarily jumped forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now it's gone," he said. "Get back in position ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">actly as you were."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Five minutes more of squirming and he announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had it. He listened with rapt attention for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and then motioned me to take his place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did so and the process of establishing a balance had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to be done all over again and again until the right posi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion was attained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I couldn't get any words except 'Nankivell' and that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very indistinctly," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved in his chair as he spoke and I heard an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">indistinct murmur. I motioned him to hold his position</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and began to move my hand about trying to bring it in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clearer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently I made out a few words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mariston, Bob Mariston," I heard faintly and dimly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as though it were a voice from another world. There</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was a pause and the voice spoke again. "Dune, oh Dune.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ray Willis. This is . .

I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">go alone, but I am willing to risk Bob for the sake of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">additional weight that he can carry but I wouldn't take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance on you. Bob is an old woodsman and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">aren't. In the third place, Bob and I have done nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">much for the world and you are doing a lot.

I did not know in what form Frank</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted it, so I made up packages containing thirty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds for each of them, assorting the material so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of them would carry each form.

We</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, or at least are sure, that the Master has given</seg><seg type="columnLine">us permission to return, but I surely wish that we knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meaning of that phrase about the way we came out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Is it blocked or open ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's fifty-fifty," replied Willis.

The Indian looked to be no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than twenty-five. His hair was black and straight; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were twin black wells that seemed to have some</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious depth. Above his eyes his eyebrows were</seg><seg type="columnLine">jet black. Long, curved black lashes protected those</seg><seg type="columnLine">twin black wells.

His look was alert and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed a scholarly forehead. He was six feet three</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches tall and was built straight as an arrow. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">kneeled and stretched his arms towards his god, he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak the moment the burning incense had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the height of his god's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, mightiest of gods!

When you awake you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will find yourself in an unknown land. You will be in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge factory which will contain all the machines neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary for your preliminary task. Outside you will find</seg><seg type="columnLine">three mines. In each of these mine? there is a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal yet unknown to Earthmen. Extract the metals</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their ores, purify them and form an alloy of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">three, using the formula that you will find written upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">parchment and placed in your hand. In the mines there</seg><seg type="columnLine">are just enough of the metals to form the required</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of alloy. When you have finished forming this</seg><seg type="columnLine">alloy, you will begin to make the projectiles with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are to transfer all races to our neighboring planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus. The alloy that you will form will have stu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendous properties after it is shaped into the projectile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a certain power, more powerful than any combina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of rays and currents yet known on Earth, is gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erated to propel it. How to make the generator for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">power and how to make the projectiles, as well as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of their stupendous properties, you will find</seg><seg type="columnLine">already instilled into your brain by hypnotism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall now explain to you what the impending dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aster is. A century ago the atmosphere was composed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">20% oxygen, 79% nitrogen, and about 1% inert gases,</seg><seg type="columnLine">including carbon dioxide. Today, unknown to the scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tists and due to the fact that all country lands have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallowed up by cities whose people have long forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to plant and how a tree looks, the oxygen has</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminished to 18%, the nitrogen remains at 79% as do</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inert gases at 1%, while carbon dioxide has increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">to 2%. The reason the oxygen has gone so slowly is</seg><seg type="columnLine">because the country only began disappearing during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last half century. People have forgotten how to plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">because their food is made in concentrated or synthetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">form from the primary constituents by scientists. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees and vegetable life have given way to skyscrapers</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hold the hustling people who are slowly overcrowd-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the world. War, as you know, has entirely ceased be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause there is only one infinitely contented class, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is no distinction between East and West and only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one person rules the entire world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Within a few centuries the oxygen will entirely dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear and in its stead will be 20% carbon dioxide be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause there will be no vegetable life to consume the car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bon dioxide which is formed in a thousand and one dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent ways, while the oxygen is being consumed con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly by all animals and by many different combustions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You now realize that life will become extinct if no</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen can be obtained to take the place of that which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">being used. There is no way to replace this gas, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">all its available compounds are being used to form the</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrated foods. To prevent the extinction of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, it is necessary to transfer the people to a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet whose atmospheric conditions are favorable for</seg><seg type="columnLine">human life.

To</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause them to become extinct and to lower the heat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet so that Earthmen should be able to accustom</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves to their immediate surroundings when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrive, will be my task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When you have finished the making of the projectiles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and generators I shall come to you again and give you</seg><seg type="columnLine">your final instructions for the salvation of humanity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Until then, Retipuj, Good-bye."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As these last words were uttered, the voice ceased and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body of Retipuj was encased in vapors. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapors had disappeared, nothing of the body could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen at the altar or elsewhere. It had vanished into thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN Ratipuj opened his eyes, he found himself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fully equipped factory, just as his god had told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him he would. In his hand he found a parchment closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">written upon, which gave him the necessary formula.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Outside he found the three mines spoken of to him while</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his trance. Immediately he began to mine the ores,</seg><seg type="columnLine">extract the three metals, purify them, and finally, alloy</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in their proper proportions. To accomplish this</seg><seg type="columnLine">task, took him the best part of fifty years, inasmuch as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was doing all this by himself and irrespective of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultra-modern apparatus at hand. When this task was</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed, he began the building of the projectiles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the generators for the new power with whose aid he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to transfer Earthmen to Venus in order to save them</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the threatening disaster. The projectiles were of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an enormous size, being one hundred feet in diameter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred feet high. Their shape was very peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to describe these projectiles is very difficult. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient to say that the top end was circular and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a point, as in a bullet, while the end upon which each</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectile rested was hexagonal. From one end to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other the shape of each projectile blended from hexagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">to circle and from circle to hexagon, never diminishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor increasing the diameter of one hundred feet. All of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the projectiles, machinery included, were built of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">alloy which we will call thulerconium. The generators</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were to furnish the unknown power were also built</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this alloy. Seven hundred of these projectiles could he</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ACT OF RETIPUJ</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">949</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">make before all of the thulerconium had been used up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To each projectile one generator was assigned. The pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectiles could not function without the aid of this gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erator. The mechanism and machinery of the projectile</seg><seg type="columnLine">and generator were so intricate that not even the cleverest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of modern and ultra-modern scientists nor the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned men had the remotest understanding of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">construction. To complete these projectiles and gener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ators took him one hundred years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon the completion of this task, he set about to build</seg><seg type="columnLine">an altar and an image of his god, which took him a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">days. Upon the completion of the altar and god, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered incense and prayed. Soon he fell into a trance</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar to his previous one and the voice of his god came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him in order to give him his final instructions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Retipuj, listen carefully to these, your final instruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. The people on Earth will not be able to exist more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than fifty years longer on this planet. My task on Venus</seg><seg type="columnLine">is complete. Within ten years, Venus will be in conjunc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with the Earth. On the night that you see a falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">star within a radius of sixty miles above you and you see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon divided by colors of red, yellow, and blue, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will know that the time has come for you to start the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight to Venus. Meanwhile notify the world of the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pending disaster through the medium of thought waves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course this will be entirely new to them for no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">has ever attempted this practice. Your will power is</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong enough to perform this seemingly impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">task. It will take you about nine years to convince the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world of what you say. If the worst comes to the worst</seg><seg type="columnLine">apply hypnotism. You are on an uncharted island re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cently placed on the Earth through an upheaval of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">section around Madagascar which has no more inhabi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tants. The tidal wave caused by this upheaval has wiped</seg><seg type="columnLine">that island clean. This island upon which you are is only</seg><seg type="columnLine">three hundred miles from Madagascar. All the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">are to come to Madagascar from which you will transfer</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to your island and immediately place them in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectiles. When all the projectiles have landed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus, I promise you that I will give you that which you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have so long sought for, death. Until then, do your</seg><seg type="columnLine">work faithfully and follow instructions carefully. Good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bye, Retipuj. You have your final instructions, for this is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last time I shall speak to you while you are alive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The voice ceased and Retipuj came out of his trance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Immediately he set himself to his task. Every day at in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tervals of three hours he sent out his warning, telling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disaster and urging all to come to him. Papers be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to speak of an unknown power that interrupted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people's thoughts at regular intervals and caused them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of an impending disaster. Vaguely to their minds</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the message and they seemed to know where to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order to escape this. They had some thought of pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectiles and Venus, although they were somewhat hazy on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that score. Steadily for nine years they felt these</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts. Each day the impulses were stronger. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers attempted to scoff away these mysterious effects</seg><seg type="columnLine">by blaming the weather and the climate which seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be slowly changing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile as the years rolled by the oxygen dimin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished as the carbon dioxide increased. Scientists and</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned men soon discovered this through various tests</seg><seg type="columnLine">and began to diagnose the thought impulses that they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been receiving all this time. Finally one man volunteered</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a service of research into this matter. They soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">were able to record the impulses on a super-phonographic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">plate which gave Retipuj's message to the world. Dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing all this time, the loss of oxygen began to put in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly work. The feeble began to die out. Tubercu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">losis became the most deadly of diseases. The strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to wilt and panic began to reign. The scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadcast Retipuj's message to the world. The message,</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides explaining the thought impulses, caused a stam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pede for the island of Retipuj. Ships, submarines, air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes, every available trans-oceanic vehicle was seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this mad rush for freedom. Many failed to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island due to death; enough lived to fill all projectiles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RETIPUJ, during all this, put all the interplanetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">. vehicles into shape. He filled all projectiles with</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough food and drink to last all the people until Venus</seg><seg type="columnLine">was reached. The new power, on decomposing, fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nished the necessary oxygen for this great journey. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as the people arrived, they were told to enter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectiles, where the stupendous properties of thuler-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conium and the new power wrought a marvelous change</seg><seg type="columnLine">on them. As each person set foot inside the projectile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was diminished in size until just one foot high. Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">many could enter each projectile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the projectiles were controlled by the one in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Retipuj had entered. All were ready for the great ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture. The night that the last projectile was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely filled, Retipuj saw the signal of the falling star</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the colors on the moon, which told him that Venus</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in conjunction with the Earth and that the time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flight had come. Upon seeing this signal, Retipuj</seg><seg type="columnLine">began the flight. All generators worked in unison and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all vehicles shot simultaneously into the air, going at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moderate speed until safely out of the Earth's air</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket when they presently attained a speed of 186,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles per second, which is equal to the velocity of light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An unusual incident awaited them upon Venus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As each vehicle came within the atmosphere of Venus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its speed was reduced and it was sent in a different direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion by Retipuj so that all vehicles would scatter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthmen all around Venus. As each projectile struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground, the Thulerconium decomposed and gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">wafted the people to the ground where they attained</seg><seg type="columnLine">their original height.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the vehicle of Retipuj decomposed, those within</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pushed aside by an unknown force. Suddenly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolt from the sky shot past Retipuj and ripped open a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big hole where he stood. A second struck him causing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to fall into the hole, while a third covered the hole so</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely that the people who started looking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Retipuj could not discern as much as a scar on the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had last been seen. He had gone to join his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fathers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During all of the recital of this extraordinary tale,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Runtas Sunaru had listened carefully. As the tale ended</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sighed. Raycrem Arsm looked up at his ruler:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You understand now why Earth has not responded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and why the name of my family is important.

As the ruler finished this avowal he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave Ruycrem his hand to seal the vow; Ruycrem seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, squeezed it once, sighed contentedly, and passed out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this world called Venus.

BREUER</seg><seg type="columnLine">Editor, Amazing Stories:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Permit me to commend your November num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber. I am very much interested in your publica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and it gives me genuine pleasure every time</seg><seg type="columnLine">you get out some good things. I've never been an</seg><seg type="columnLine">editor and don't know how it feels; but I rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine that in these days of quantity production</seg><seg type="columnLine">and high pressure living and superficial achieve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, an editor of a sciencc-fiction magazine must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be up against it sometimes if he really prefers</seg><seg type="columnLine">literature to twaddle. I judge that by the stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">I read in the general run of scicnce-fiction maga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zines. As far as my own reading goes, ninety per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent of present-day scicnce-fiction as a whole is on</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the same plane as the general run of Wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">West and low-brow detective talcs. I can imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">the editor raising his hands to heaven and suppli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cating Providence to send him something with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least bit of literary flavor in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The November number was good; but two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stories appealed to me especially as a student</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the literary phases of sciencc-fiction. One was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stanton A. Coblentz' ''Missionaries From the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Sky." Heretofore, I have preferred Mr. Coblentz'</seg><seg type="columnLine">(if there is a "doctor" or a "professor" before</seg><seg type="columnLine">your name, please indulge my ignorance of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">point) popular-scientific essays and books, to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiction. Up-to-date he has not taken into considera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion the fact that pure fantasy is not literature, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot appeal to the cultured reader. His stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been largely untamed and unconfincd soarings</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the realms of scientific speculation, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">the touch of realism that is demanded in modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">literature, and with little interest in charactcr and</seg><seg type="columnLine">human motive. But, I like "The Missionaries</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the Sky" partly because it is short. (Poe</seg><seg type="columnLine">was right; many years ago he wrote that a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">literary work cannot be a work of art. because</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention and emotion cannot be sustained for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time.) Partly because it gives us drama, con*</seg><seg type="columnLine">flict of human motives. And partly bccausc it</seg><seg type="columnLine">attains the atmosphere of realism, without which</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sciencc-fiction story can be anything else than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">psychological document, interesting to the psychiat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rist who is studying the mental state of the writer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but to no one else. Mr. Coblentz has the scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">background; I rejoice very much to see him also</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">developing the literary touch. All I know about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him is what I gather from reading his stories in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this magazine, and all I say is based on such read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and on nothing else. Come again, Mr. Cob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lentz, with a short one, with real people and a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vincing atmosphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other is Jack Williamson's "The Cosmic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Express." I have been intensely interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack Williamson ever since I made his literary</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquaintance. Though his first story showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">chiefly promise of future possibilities, yet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise was there. I have hoped that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize that real lovers of literature cannot possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">be interested in the play of rays on some distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">asteroid, or the conflict of imaginary monsters that</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained one's receptive imagination. I have hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would understand that the only thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the readers of the ages arc interested in, is people;</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they are, but especially, what they do. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew he would do it some day, and he has done</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in "The Cosmic Express." In this story he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked out one of the principal raisons d'etre of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciencc-fiction: the effect upon human nature and</seg><seg type="columnLine">(.Continued on page 954)</seg><seg type="columnLine">January, 1931</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">953</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Always outside of things</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that's where I was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve short months ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I just didn't have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cash, that was all.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of grunted when we told him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">news, and asked Louise to leave us alone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, my heart began to sink as I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you and Louise have decided to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">married," he said to me when we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. "Well, Bill, just listen to me.

I knew your</seg><seg type="columnLine">father and mother, and you've always had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good reputation here, too. But let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask you just one question--how much</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you make?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twenty-eight a week," I told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't say a word--just wrote it</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on a piece of paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you any prospects of a better job</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a good raise some time soon ?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir; I can't honestly say that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have," I admitted.

When he saw my</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion he grunted. "I thought so," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.

Here's Budget No. 1: I figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can afford a very small unfurnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment, make your payments on enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain, inexpensive furniture to fix such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment up, pay your electricity, gas and</seg><seg type="columnLine">water bills, buy just about one modest out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit of clothes for both of you once each</seg><seg type="columnLine">year, and save three dollars a week for</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickness, insurance, and emergencies.

It is this:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the story "The Dynasty of the Blue-Black</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Rays" by Milton R. Peril, Tcnta Raci, the leader</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the Incan band, asks "What century is this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and is answered by one of the explorers, "The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">twentieth." Possibly Mr. Peril has the notion that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Incas dated their years from the birth of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Christ. I doubt that they ever heard of Christ</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">until the coming of Pizarro and the Spaniards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Maybe they reckoned their dates by the year of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the ruler's reign. However, I am not an authority</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on this, and I can leave it to Mr. Verrill, or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some other ethnologist to explain this. But they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">certainly didn't know what the twentieth century</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was. The explorer most likely should have ans-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wered, "The eight-hundredth since the accession</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Manco Capac." It would have been more en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lightening to the marooned Incans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The rest of the October issue was excellent--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> each issue surpasses the last. First in my pref-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> erence list comes the conclusion of "Skylark</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three." The science and adventure fairly took</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> my breath away. Tell Dr. Smith not to stop but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to keep on with his wonderful stories. Next comes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the story "The Prince of Liars." It is Mr. Han-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sen's best. It is told in such a queer and yet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> plausible way that one-half believes and half dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> believes it. Next in my estimation is "The Man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> from the Moon" by Otis Adclbert Kline. This</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> story is a sort of prelude to "Maza of the Moon"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> which appeared in Argosy last winter. The other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> stories were up to the Amazing Stories standard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The best novel that has appeared in Amazing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Stories to date, in my opinion, is "Skylark</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Three"; the best novelette, "The Green Splotches,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the best short story, "Madness of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dust." My favorite authors are Dr. Smith, R. F.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Starzl, T. S. Stribling, A. Merritt, John W.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Campbell, Jr., and Isaac R. Nathanson. Please</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">give us more of these authors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  About reprints. How about giving us one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">serial reprint a year for us hungry reprint fans?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I would suggest running Garrett P. Serviss's novel,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The Conquest of Mars" as the first. If this is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">absolutely impossible, please try printing them in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">paper-bound books at about 50c apiece. I hope</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that any reprint fans that want this will write in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and endorse my proposition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Interplanetary stories, as you may notice, are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> my dish. I can't get too much of them. I'll</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> stick to Amazing Stories as long 3s you keep</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> publishing them.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think I have already written about the October</seg><seg type="columnLine">issue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Drums of Tapajos," Capt S. P. Meek--</seg><seg type="columnLine">First third. As usual Captain Meek is up to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual high standard. Hope the second and third</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirds are_ as good--dare not hope they are better</seg><seg type="columnLine">--else he' will be equalling Dr. E. E. Smith's</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Skylark" masterpieces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Globoid Terror"--R. F. Starzl. In my esti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation the title is misleading--very little is men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned about the Globoid. Looks to me like merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">the usual villain-hero-heroine type of story with</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically no science--or should I say "super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">science." Really far below your usual standard for</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pineal Stimulator." I. S. Stephens and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fletcher Pratt. Very good. I rate it along with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Capt. Meek's short stories in previous issues.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Missionaries from tho Sky." S. A. Coblentz.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Very good. Will he write or has he written a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequel? He ought to--after having the Martians</seg><seg type="columnLine">all ready--actually* entering their balloon suits--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their journey of conquest over the earth--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could have another "War of the Planets" but</seg><seg type="columnLine">let's hope it will be somewhat different.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cosmic Express." Jack Williamson. A four-*</seg><seg type="columnLine">star story except for one thing, which reduces it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a two-star tale, that being the hero and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heroine took no food--no matches--no arms. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">went at it too casually to be "true to life" to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">as really interesting as Jack usually writes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Solarite"--John W. Campbell, Jr. I saved it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the last purposely in this letter as I want you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell J. W. C. Jr. of a couple of mistakes he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made which would have ruined the story were he</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the excellent author he is. First; page 731--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Read the paragraph beginning in the right hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">column: "Objects could pass right through us just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they passed through the air" (as long as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">"were transparent")--only opaque objects were</seg><seg type="columnLine">susceptible."--All O.K. so far--except--page 736</seg><seg type="columnLine">--line 9 to 32--Arcot dropped a can of luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">paint on the enemy plane which was transparent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same as the author had the Solarite--you re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member objects passed right through while it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same state as the enemy plane. Page 733</seg><seg type="columnLine">--L. H. column--52 lines from top (the beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the address.) Who made this address? Part</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be by Arcot--part by the Venerian or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Venerians. Which was it? Who made this</seg><seg type="columnLine">error, the author or did your printer leave out</seg><seg type="columnLine">part?--Also on page 733--preceding the address</seg><seg type="columnLine">referred to-- the Venerian speaks--"you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">little gold and platinum--and morlus is unknown"</seg><seg type="columnLine">--"in token of our appreciation we present this</seg><seg type="columnLine">small disc of morlus to each of you." How come</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Campbell did not finish the thought he started</seg><seg type="columnLine">and have the Venerians load down the Solarite</seg><seg type="columnLine">with gold and platinum? He evidently meant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have his Venerians do so but overlooked it until</seg><seg type="columnLine">way at the end of the story where the trend of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought had been broken--now a few pieces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravel to go along with the heavy masonry I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast. The captured enemy plane--why was it not</seg><seg type="columnLine">used in the fight?--How did he communicate with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kaxorians by radio when he was not sure they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a radio system--judging by the Lanorians not</seg><seg type="columnLine">having one, as stated--not positively--on page 723</seg><seg type="columnLine">--L. If. column, 12th to 22nd lines. Speaking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisibility--could not Arcot have interfered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enemy's invisibility quite as easily by elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trical vibrations as the enemy did with his own--</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than bring in the luminous paint? Also</seg><seg type="columnLine">how did the luminous paint spread to cover such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large surface in so small a quantity and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">short a time? Another thing! (As Andy says to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Min)--isn't it the theory that the sun's heat is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiated through free space but that its light is</seg><seg type="columnLine">some way rectified into heat after reaching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth or its atmosphere? Else why the supposedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">intense cold of free space (theoretically). Also</seg><seg type="columnLine">--if the Solarite received its energy by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">collector discs--which must face the sun--what</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to this supply of energy when avoiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">a meteorite with the discs away from the sun?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also on these sudden turns at the enormous speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of around 12 M.P. sec.--well--remember the 300</seg><seg type="columnLine">M.P. hour aeroplane. It speaks well for J. W. C.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jr's. writing ability that even with these errors</seg><seg type="columnLine">and discrepancies I stiil can rate his story at three</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Won't you call J.

Well, here is a letter from an even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more distant reader. So distant that it has taken</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me from November until now to find a store where</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I may obtain your magazine regularly. Should this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">store fail me, I shall probably be sending you an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">S.O.S. for a supply direct from you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  To date I have read only your November and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">April issues, but these have been sufficient to make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me eager to miss no more.

Also they are cleverly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">written and bear witness to exhaustive scientific</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knowledge 011 the part of your authors. It is a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pleasure indeed to hear from such men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I notice that some of your correspondents criti-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cize your stories for their improbability, but to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me this is their chief virtue. So many "impossi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ble" theories of the 19th century arc now familiar,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">established facts, that one must hesitate to condemn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">anything impossible today as impossible for all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time.

They open up a delightful field of conjecture,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">although I hope that our first overtures towards our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">neighbors are not met with the hostility usually</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">portrayed by authors. I liked "The Metal Horde"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for its idea of interplanetary friendship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Cold Light" I enjoyed, it seemed to hang to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gether so well.

Some of these theories are set forth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">most convincingly and in such fashion that each</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">step of reasoning involved may be clearly followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I would like to read some more about the Fourth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dimension. May I mention that I found most in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">teresting the letter from Mr. Frank Brueckel, Jr.,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">published in your April columns re the Einstein</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Theory of Relativity, and the "Godesic Flyer." I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have not read the story in question but found Mr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Brueckel's letter ample compensation.

When I have read</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more of your issues, and have had an opportunity</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to become more familiar with your authors, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would like to write to you again and perhaps ask a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">few questions. As for criticism--well I am no be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">liever in this, realizing that your selections arc</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">carefully and wisely made, but I certainly have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">110 use at all for destructive criticism.

Personally, the more flaws I find in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">story the better I like it, and I know that it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same with many other readers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I have not noticed lately any criticisms of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mathematics of any of the stories you have printed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although some authors are particularly careless in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this field. Take our friend Baron Munchhausen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must apologize for resurrecting back numbers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but really the chance is too good to miss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1.	The Baron's space flyer has for its motive</seg><seg type="columnLine">power the moon's gravity alone. The trip to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon only takes 104 hours but in practice it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be impossible to accomplish the trip in less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">9x/e days, under the given conditions as mathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matical reasoning readily shows. The return trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take 4 days, but that is another matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 2.	The Baron begins to retard his space flyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">when 600 miles from the surface of the moon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">using the earth's gravitational attraction. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">is impossible as the gravitational attraction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth near the moon is 1/3600th of its value on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth's surface, and in the distance named</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only produce a retardation of about 5/5/11</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles per hour, so that the space flyer would</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash into the moon with a velocity of 2394 6/11</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles per hour, assuming it to travel at 2400</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles per hour before retardation, as it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Baron took 48 minutes to "fall" right</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the moon's center. In actual practice he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take 81 minutes. It is not hard to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baron's error here. He used the time honored</seg><seg type="columnLine">formula S --l/i a t- and put o=acceleration at</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon's surface. Calculation actually docs give</seg><seg type="columnLine">about 48 minutes, but really this single equa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is no longer valid, as a is not constant</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout, as Munchhausen assumed. It de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creases as we approach the moon's center; having</seg><seg type="columnLine">zero value there. This problem is insoluble with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the aid of the calculus (as is also the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem).</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently Mr. Gernsback does not count among</seg><seg type="columnLine">his .accomplishments a knowledge of higher mathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matics, hence his errors. I have enclosed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solutions of these problems to support the asser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions made in this letter. There may be arithmeti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal mistakes, but I have gone over them care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully.

I saw in the "Discussions Corner"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a letter from a Seottie and thought that you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">might like to hear the opinion of a "Paddy." Like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Seottie, I get my Amazing Stories at Wool-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">worth's stores here in Cork. First, about the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">authors. Edmond Hamilton, Dr. Keller, and Jack</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Williamson are strong favorites with me. I have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no special favorite, as they are all so good. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">think that there is no artist to beat Wesso, as his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pictures are all absolutely marvelous and I ad-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mire his fertile imagination sincerely. If Wesso</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">left "A. S." it would be almost a tragedy. Re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">garding your cover, I think that there is not a more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attractive cover on the whole bookstand. I think</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the paper could be improved a bit, although</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I think that it has improved lately. I wish that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I could be assured of getting "A.

I thought that ''The Universe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Wreckers" was a fine story even if it was strained</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a little too far out of the ordinary. The "Gimlet"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was a bit of a bore, not because it was a very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">foolish story, but because it was written in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">language too advanced for the average layman-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reader. Before I forget it, I want to say more(y)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about that cover. Why did I neglect to say some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing about Morey before? If he can draw a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beautiful design like that on the April number, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is worthy of as much praise as Wesso. By the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">way, were the Andromcdans made of metal or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what? If I sent you 15/-, which is about three</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dollars and fifty cents, could I get a year's sub-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scription to "A. S."?

As near as I can under-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stand, this void is a perfect vacuum, therefore</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">frictionless and of no resistance whatever to light</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rays.

It is originality in plot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When A. S. was first launched on the stands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was an original idea in periodicals. It caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the public's attention and held it--but, in my esti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation, is wearing off. Why? Some time back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reader wrote in Discussions that he had read</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first few issues of the magazine and then, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming fed up on interplanetary travel, atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy, etc., he had stopped reading the book for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several months. Picking an issue up at a later</seg><seg type="columnLine">date, he was pleased to find new plots and original</seg><seg type="columnLine">themes. Perhaps you can see here what I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving at.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, honestly, admit it. How much longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you think your publication will last if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep up what you have been doing for a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time; namely, giving us stories with the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">old plots, ideas and murderous scientists? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other science-fiction magazines have the same fail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, the readers are treated to an original idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">only once in a blue moon. Some one said that It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was extremely difficult to think up an entirely new</seg><seg type="columnLine">theme. It is hard but I have tried it and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought about eight entirely new themes. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that your magazine can survive another ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">years if you give interplanetary talcs with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same old wars and weary old formulas. A good ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ception is The Skylark of Space. Atomic energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">is in it too, but it is so different from the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was welcomed with a great shout of</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief and a general clamor for a sequel. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequel, Skylark Three, shows so many original</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ideas in the very first installment, that I'd '&gt;e</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to wager that another shout for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequel arises. Good old Dr. Smith; he realizes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a change is a good tonic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You may think I'm exaggerating when I say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that every science-fiction magazine seems to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the brink of the downward path, but I mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">just what I say. What is needed? The tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">business man who secs, day in and day out, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same old scencs and sights, gets a tip from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">M.D. to give himself a treat to new scenes. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what all science-fiction magazines need. New ideas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not carbon copies of something that somebody</seg><seg type="columnLine">has written before. That is all I have to say on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this matter, Mr. Editor, and I wonder what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There Is something in my mind which has</seg><seg type="columnLine">bothered me -since the September, 1928, issue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is: Why doesn't H. G. Wells appear any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more? True, you published his Lord of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamos since that month, but it covered a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">small amount of space. In my opinion, it is Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wells who pul Amazing Stories on its feet. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I mean that a person, who picked up an</seg><seg type="columnLine">issue for the first time, was attracted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine by the name of H G. Wells more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he had just looked at the cover illustration.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The magazine needed somebody to advertise</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether or not the stories were just filthy trash</seg><seg type="columnLine">--amazing stories--or talcs worthy of being read</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">over and over again. Mr. Wells' name cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered that point. All of which brings nre to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement: I, and almost everybody in the Brook-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lyn Scientific Club, and other outsiders, want</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stories of Mr. Wells where they belong--</seg><seg type="columnLine">in A. S.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And how about Jules Verne?

By the way, what chance of letting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tubby go in a new trip around the universe?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seems a shame to let Tubby stay where he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not come into the open once more.
